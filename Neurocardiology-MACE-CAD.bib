abstract = {AIMS:The density HRV parameter Dyx is a new heart rate variability (HRV) measure based on multipole analysis of the Poincar{\'{e}} plot obtained from RR interval time series, deriving information from both the time and frequency domain. Preliminary results have suggested that the parameter may provide new predictive information on mortality in survivors of acute myocardial infarction (MI). This study compares the prognostic significance of Dyx to that of traditional linear and nonlinear measures of HRV.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS:In the Nordic ICD pilot study, patients with an acute MI were screened with 2D echocardiography and 24-hour Holter recordings. The study was designed to assess the power of several HRV measures to predict mortality. Dyx was tested in a subset of 206 consecutive Danish patients with analysable Holter recordings. After a median follow-up of 8.5 years 70 patients had died. Of all traditional and multipole HRV parameters, reduced Dyx was the most powerful predictor of all-cause mortality (HR 2.4; CI 1.5 to 3.8; P {\textless} 0.001). After adjustment for known risk markers, such as age, diabetes, ejection fraction, previous MI and hypertension, Dyx remained an independent predictor of mortality (P = 0.02). Reduced Dyx also predicted cardiovascular death (P {\textless} 0.01) and sudden cardiovascular death (P = 0.05). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, Dyx significantly predicted mortality in patients both with and without impaired left ventricular systolic function (P {\textless} 0.0001).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION:The new nonlinear HRV measure Dyx is a promising independent predictor of mortality in a long-term follow-up study of patients surviving a MI, irrespectively of left ventricular systolic function.},

abstract = {Background: Psychological stress is a risk factor for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in individuals with coronary artery disease. Certain brain regions that control both emotional states and cardiac physiology may be involved in this relationship. The rostromedial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC) is an important brain region that processes stress and regulates immune and autonomic functions. Changes in rmPFC activity with emotional stress (reactivity) may be informative of future risk for MACE. Methods: Participants with stable coronary artery disease underwent acute mental stress testing using a series of standardized speech/arithmetic stressors and simultaneous brain imaging with high-resolution positron emission tomography brain imaging. We defined high rmPFC activation as a difference between stress and control scans greater than the median value for the entire cohort. Interleukin-6 levels 90 minutes after stress, and high-frequency heart rate variability during stress were also assessed. We defined MACE as a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina with revascularization, and heart failure hospitalization. Results: We studied 148 subjects (69{\%} male) with mean±SD age of 62±8 years. After adjustment for baseline demographics, risk factors, and baseline levels of interleukin-6 and high-frequency heart rate variability, higher rmPFC stress reactivity was independently associated with higher interleukin-6 and lower high-frequency heart rate variability with stress. During a median follow-up of 3 years, 34 subjects (21.3{\%}) experienced a MACE. Each increase of 1 SD in rmPFC activation with mental stress was associated with a 21{\%} increase risk of MACE (hazard ratio, 1.21 [95{\%} CI, 1.08-1.37]). Stress-induced interleukin-6 and high-frequency heart rate variability explained 15.5{\%} and 32.5{\%} of the relationship between rmPFC reactivity and MACE, respectively. Addition of rmPFC reactivity to conventional risk factors improved risk reclassification for MACE prediction, and C-statistic improved from 0.71 to 0.76 (P=0.03). Conclusions: Greater rmPFC stress reactivity is associated with incident MACE. Immune and autonomic responses to mental stress may play a contributory role.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Abnormalities in the autonomic nervous system may occur in ischemic heart disease, but the mechanisms by which they are linked are not fully defined. The risk of cardiac events is increased during morning hours. Studying the contributions of autonomic mechanisms may yield insights into risk stratification and treatment. We hypothesize that autonomic dysfunction, measured by decreased heart rate variability (HRV), associates with abnormal stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). METHODS We performed a cross-sectional study of the association between abnormal myocardial stress perfusion with HRV using 276 middle-aged veteran twins without known ischemic heart disease. The primary independent variable was cardiac autonomic regulation measured with 24-hour electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, using linear and non-linear (multipole density, or Dyx) HRV metrics. The primary outcome was abnormal perfusion ({\textgreater}5{\%} affected myocardium) during adenosine stress on [13N]-ammonia myocardial perfusion imaging with positron emission tomography. RESULTS The mean (SD) age was 53 (3) years and 55 (20{\%}) had abnormal perfusion. HRV (by Dyx) was reduced during morning hours in subjects with abnormal perfusion. At 7 AM, each standard deviation (SD) decrease in Dyx was associated a 4.8 (95{\%} CI, 1.5 - 15.8) odds ratio (OR) for abnormal MPI. With Dyx {\textless} 2.0, the 7 AM OR for abnormal MPI was 11.8 (95{\%} CI, 1.2 - 111.4). CONCLUSIONS Autonomic dysfunction, measured by non-linear HRV in the morning hours, was associated with an increased OR of abnormal MPI. These results suggest a potentially important role of ECG-based biomarkers in risk stratification for individuals with suspected ischemic heart disease.},

abstract = {Background: Decreased vagal activity after myocardial infarction results in reduced heart-rate variability and increased risk of death. To distinguish between vagal and sympathetic factors that affect heart-rate variability, we used a signal-processing algorithm to separately characterise deceleration and acceleration of heart rate. We postulated that diminished deceleration-related modulation of heart rate is an important prognostic marker. Our prospective hypotheses were that deceleration capacity is a better predictor of risk than left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN). Methods: We quantified heart rate deceleration capacity by assessing 24-h Holter recordings from a post-infarction cohort in Munich (n=1455). We blindly validated the prognostic power of deceleration capacity in post-infarction populations in London, UK (n=656), and Oulu, Finland (n=600). We tested our hypotheses by assessment of the area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve (AUC). Findings: During a median follow-up of 24 months, 70 people died in the Munich cohort and 66 in the London cohort. The Oulu cohort was followed-up for 38 months and 77 people died. In the London cohort, mean AUC of deceleration capacity was 0{\textperiodcentered}80 (SD 0{\textperiodcentered}03) compared with 0{\textperiodcentered}67 (0{\textperiodcentered}04) for LVEF and 0{\textperiodcentered}69 (0{\textperiodcentered}04) for SDNN. In the Oulu cohort, mean AUC of deceleration capacity was 0{\textperiodcentered}74 (0{\textperiodcentered}03) compared with 0{\textperiodcentered}60 (0{\textperiodcentered}04) for LVEF and 0{\textperiodcentered}64 (0{\textperiodcentered}03) for SDNN (p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001 for all comparisons). Stratification by dichotomised deceleration capacity was especially powerful in patients with preserved LVEF (p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001 in all cohorts). Interpretation: Impaired heart rate deceleration capacity is a powerful predictor of mortality after myocardial infarction and is more accurate than LVEF and the conventional measures of heart-rate variability. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Background - The incremental prognostic value of stress single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for the prediction of cardiac death as an individual end point and the implications for risk stratification are undefined. Methods and Results - We identified 5183 consecutive patients who underwent stress/rest SPECT and were followed up for the occurrence of cardiac death or myocardial infarction. Over a mean follow up of 642±226 days, 119 cardiac deaths and 158 myocardial infarctions occurred (3.0{\%} cardiac death rate, 2.3{\%} myocardial infarction rate). Patients with normal scans were at low risk (≤0.5{\%}/y), and rates of both outcomes increased significantly with worsening scan abnormalities. Patients who underwent exercise stress and had mildly abnormal scans had low rates of cardiac death but higher rates of myocardial infarction (0.7{\%}/y versus 2.6{\%}/y; P{\textless}.05). After adjustment for prescan information, scan results provided incremental prognostic value toward the prediction of cardiac death. The identification of patients at intermediate risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction and low risk for cardiac death by SPECT may result in significant cost savings when applied to a clinical testing strategy. Conclusions - Myocardial perfusion SPECT yields incremental prognostic information toward the identification of cardiac death. Patients with mildly abnormal scans after exercise stress are at low risk for cardiac death but intermediate risk for nonfatal myocardial infarction and thus may benefit from a noninvasive strategy and may not require invasive management.},

abstract = {The monoaminergic innervation of the coronary vessels and myocardium in the dog was studied by means of the histochemical fluorescence method. The distribution of monoaminergic terminals in the arterial wall depends on the diameter of the artery. In large arteries, the terminals are regularly distributed around the entire circumference, the fibres being situated between the elastic lamellae of the adventitia. The terminals within the media could not be detected. In small arteries, the sympathetic ground plexus aggregates in two parallel strands, the artery being between them. In arterioles, two thick fibres only accompany the vellel. The myocardium is innervated by means of a three-dimensional sympathetic ground plexus distributed between the myocardial cells independently of vessels. No difference in density of innervation was found between the right and left heart. The point-counting method, on the other hand, has revealed that the density of innervation in the left auricle is nearly twice as dense as in the left ventricle. The terminals innervating the myocardium are markedly thinner than the fibres innervating the arteries. Two-dimensional plexuses innervate the epicardium, endocardium and valves.},

There was a linear trend with the severity of CAD; median LF power (IQR) in patients with normal coronaries was 275 (612), with minor coronary irregularities 255 (400), single-vessel CAD 212 (396) and more severe disease 170 (327) ms(2); p value for trend 0.003. There was a similar reduction in LF power regardless of the anatomical location of coronary stenoses. Comparing patients with LF less than 250 and 250 ms(2) or greater, the adjusted OR for obstructive CAD using multivariate regression was 2.42, 95{\%} CI 1.33 to 4.38 (p=0.004).

abstract = {Coronary artery disease is prevalent in different causes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), especially in individuals presenting with shockable rhythms of ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/pVT). The purpose of this report is to review the known prevalence and potential importance of coronary artery disease in patients with OHCA and to describe the emerging paradigm of treatment with advanced perfusion/reperfusion techniques and their potential benefits on the basis of available evidence. Although randomized clinical trials are planned or ongoing, current scientific evidence rests principally on observational case series with their potential confounding selection bias. Among patients resuscitated from VF/pVT OHCA with ST-segment elevation on their postresuscitation ECG, the prevalence of coronary artery disease has been shown to be 70{\%} to 85{\%}. More than 90{\%} of these patients have had successful percutaneous coronary intervention. Conversely, among patients resuscitated from VF/pVT OHCA without ST-segment elevation on their postresuscitation ECG, the prevalence of coronary artery disease has been shown to be 25{\%} to 50{\%}. For these patients, early access to the cardiac catheterization laboratory is associated with a 10{\%} to 15{\%} absolute higher functionally favorable survival rate compared with more conservative approaches of late or no access to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. In patients with VF/pVT OHCA refractory to standard treatment, a new treatment paradigm is also emerging that uses venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to facilitate return of normal perfusion and to support further resuscitation efforts, including coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention. The burden of coronary artery disease is high in this patient population, presumably causative in most patients. The strategy of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, coronary angiography, and percutaneous coronary intervention has resulted in functionally favorable survival rates ranging from 9{\%} to 45{\%} in observational studies in this patient population. Patients with VF/pVT should be considered at the highest severity in the continuum of acute coronary syndromes. These patients have a significant burden of coronary artery disease and acute coronary thrombotic events. Evidence from randomized trials will further define optimal clinical practice.},

The Statistical Update represents a critical resource for the lay public, policy makers, media professionals, clinicians, healthcare administrators, researchers, health advocates, and others seeking the best available data on these factors and conditions. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke produce immense health and economic burdens in the United States and globally. The Update also presents the latest data on a range of major clinical heart and circulatory disease conditions (including stroke, congenital heart disease, rhythm disorders, subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease [CHD], heart failure [HF], valvular disease, venous disease, and peripheral artery disease) and the associated outcomes (including quality of care, procedures, and economic costs). Since 2007, the annual versions of the Statistical Update have been cited {\textgreater}20 000 times in the literature. From January to July 2017 alone, the 2017 Statistical Update was accessed {\textgreater}106 500 times. Each annual version of the Statistical Update undergoes revisions to include the newest nationally representative data, add additional relevant published scientific findings, remove older information, add new sections or chapters, and increase the number of ways to access and use the assembled information. This year-long process, which begins as soon as the previous Statistical Update is published, is performed by the AHA Statistics Committee faculty volunteers and staff and government agency partners. This year's edition includes new data on the monitoring and benefits of cardiovascular health in the population, new metrics to assess and monitor healthy diets, new information on stroke in young adults, an enhanced focus on underserved and minority populations, a substantively expanded focus on the global burden of CVD, and further evidence-based approaches to changing behaviors, implementation strategies, and implications of the AHA's 2020 Impact Goals.

Objectives This study assessed the predictive accuracy and improvement in reclassification gained by the addition of the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score, the ankle-brachial index (ABI), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels, and family history (FH) of ASCVD to the PCE in participants of MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis). Methods The PCE was calibrated (cPCE) and used for this analysis. The Cox proportional hazards survival model, Harrell's C statistics, and net reclassification improvement analyses were used. ASCVD was defined as myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease-related death, or fatal or nonfatal stroke. Results Of 6,814 MESA participants not prescribed statins at baseline, 5,185 had complete data and were included in this analysis. Their mean age was 61 years; 53.1{\%} were women, 9.8{\%} had diabetes, and 13.6{\%} were current smokers. After 10 years of follow-up, 320 (6.2{\%}) ASCVD events occurred.

abstract = {Background: The associations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and coronary heart disease mortality in an exclusively low estimated 10-year risk group are not well delineated. We sought to determine the long-term associations of various LDL-C and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) thresholds and CVD and coronary heart disease mortality in a large, low 10-year risk cohort. Methods: The study sample included participants of the CCLS (Cooper Center Longitudinal Study) without a history of CVD or diabetes mellitus and defined as low risk ({\textless}7.5{\%}) for 10-year atherosclerotic CVD events at baseline based on Pooled Cohort Risk Assessment Equations. The associations of fasting LDL-C and non-HDL-C with CVD mortality were tested with Cox proportional hazards models. Results: In 36 375 participants (72{\%} men, median age 42) followed for a median of 26.8 years, 1086 CVD and 598 coronary heart disease deaths occurred. Compared with LDL-C {\textless}100 mg/dL, LDL-C categories 100 to 129 mg/dL, 130 to 159 mg/dL, 160 to 189.9 mg/dL, and ≥190 mg/dL were associated with a significantly higher risk of CVD death, with hazard ratios of 1.4 (95{\%} CI, 1.1-1.7), 1.3 (95{\%} CI, 1.1-1.6), 1.9 (95{\%} CI, 1.5-2.4), and 1.7 (95{\%} CI, 1.3-2.3), and mean reductions in years free of CVD death of 1.8, 1.1, 4.3, and 3.9, respectively. After adjustment for atherosclerotic CVD risk factors, LDL-C categories 160 to 189 mg/dL and ≥190 mg/dL remained independently associated with CVD mortality, with hazard ratios of 1.7 (95{\%} CI, 1.4-2.2) and 1.5 (95{\%} CI, 1.2-2.1), respectively. In multivariable-adjusted models using non-HDL-C {\textless}130 mg/dL as the reference, non-HDL-C 160 to 189 mg/dL, 190 to 219 mg/dL, and ≥220 mg/dL were significantly associated with CVD death, with hazard ratios of 1.3 (95{\%} CI, 1.1-1.6), 1.8 (95{\%} CI, 1.4-2.2), and 1.5 (95{\%} CI, 1.2-2.0), respectively. Restricting the cohort to those with 10-year risk {\textless}5{\%} did not diminish the associations of LDL-C and non-HDL-C with CVD mortality. Conclusions: In a low 10-year risk cohort with long-term follow-up, LDL-C and non-HDL-C ≥160 mg/dL were independently associated with a 50{\%} to 80{\%} increased relative risk of CVD mortality. These findings may have implications for future cholesterol treatment paradigms.},

abstract = {Background Detecting significant coronary artery disease (CAD) in the general population is complex and relies on combined assessment of traditional CAD risk factors and noninvasive testing. We hypothesized that a CAD-specific heart rate variability (HRV) algorithm can be used to improve detection of subclinical or early ischemia in patients without known CAD. Methods and Results Between 2014 and 2018 we prospectively enrolled 1043 patients with low to intermediate pretest probability for CAD who were screened for myocardial ischemia in tertiary medical centers in the United States and Israel. Patients underwent 1-hour Holter testing, with immediate HRV analysis using the HeartTrends DyDx algorithm, followed by exercise stress echocardiography (n=612) or exercise myocardial perfusion imaging (n=431). The threshold for low HRV was identified using receiver operating characteristic analysis based on sensitivity and specificity. The primary end point was the presence of myocardial ischemia detected by exercise stress echocardiography or exercise myocardial perfusion imaging. The mean age of patients was 61 years and 38{\%} were women. Myocardial ischemia was detected in 66 (6.3{\%}) patients. After adjustment for CAD risk factors and exercise stress testing results, low HRV was independently associated with a significant 2-fold increased likelihood for myocardial ischemia (odds ratio, 2.00; 95{\%} CI, 1.41-2.89 [P=0.01]). Adding HRV to traditional CAD risk factors significantly improved the pretest probability for myocardial ischemia. Conclusions Our data from a large prospective international clinical study show that short-term HRV testing can be used as a novel digital-health modality for enhanced risk assessment in low- to intermediate-risk individuals without known CAD.

abstract = {IMPORTANCE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death among adults in the United States. Treatment to prevent CVD events by modifying risk factors is currently informed by the Framingham Risk Score, the Pooled Cohort Equations, or similar CVD risk assessment models. If current CVD risk assessment models could be improved by adding more risk factors, treatment might be better targeted, thereby maximizing the benefits and minimizing the harms. OBJECTIVE To update the 2009 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on using nontraditional risk factors in coronary heart disease risk assessment. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on using nontraditional risk factors in CVD risk assessment, focusing on the ankle-brachial index (ABI), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level, and coronary artery calcium (CAC) score; the health benefits and harms of CVD risk assessment and treatment guided by nontraditional risk factors combined with the Framingham Risk Score or Pooled Cohort Equations compared with using either risk assessment model alone; and whether adding nontraditional risk factors to existing CVD risk assessment models improves measures of calibration, discrimination, and risk reclassification. FINDINGS The USPSTF found adequate evidence that adding the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score to existing CVD risk assessment models results in small improvements in discrimination and risk reclassification; however, the clinical meaning of these changes is largely unknown. Evidence on adding the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score to the Pooled Cohort Equations is limited. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess whether treatment decisions guided by the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score, in addition to risk factors in existing CVD risk assessment models, leads to reduced incidence of CVD events or mortality. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to conceptually bound the harms of early detection and interventions as small. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of using the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score in risk assessment for CVD in asymptomatic adults to prevent CVD events. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of adding the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score to traditional risk assessment for CVD in asymptomatic adults to prevent CVD events.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) has been shown to be attenuated in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and may, therefore, be possibly used for the early detection of myocardial ischemia. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic yield of a novel short-term HRV algorithm for the detection of myocardial ischemia in subjects without known CAD. We prospectively enrolled 450 subjects without known CAD who were referred to tertiary medical centers for exercise stress testing (EST) with single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). All subjects underwent 1-hour Holter testing with subsequent HRV analysis before EST with MPI. The diagnostic yield of HRV analysis was compared with EST, using MPI as the gold standard for the noninvasive detection of myocardial ischemia. All subjects had intermediate pretest probability for CAD. Mean age was 62 years, 38{\%} were women, 51{\%} had hypertension, and 25{\%} diabetes mellitus. HRV analysis showed superior sensitivity (77{\%}) compared with standard EST (27{\%}). After multivariate adjustment, HRV was independently associated with an 8.4-fold (p {\textless}0.001) increased likelihood for the detection of myocardial ischemia by MPI, whereas EST did not show a statistically significant association with a positive MPI (odds ratio 2.1; p = 0.12). Of subjects who were referred for subsequent coronary angiography, the respective sensitivities of HRV and EST for the detection of significant CAD were 73{\%} versus 26{\%}. Our data suggest that HRV can be used as an important noninvasive technique for the detection of myocardial ischemia in subjects without known CAD, providing superior sensitivity to conventional EST in this population.},

abstract = {Background: Clinical features from electronic health records (EHRs) can be used to build a complementary tool to predict coronary artery disease (CAD) susceptibility. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine whether an EHR score can improve CAD prediction and reclassification 1 year before diagnosis, beyond conventional clinical guidelines as determined by the pooled cohort equations (PCE) and a polygenic risk score for CAD. Methods: We applied a machine learning framework using clinical features from the EHR in a multiethnic, clinical care cohort (BioMe) comprising 555 CAD cases and 6,349 control subjects and in a population-based cohort (UK Biobank) comprising 3,130 CAD cases and 378,344 control subjects for external validation. Results: Compared with the PCE, the EHR score improved CAD prediction by 12{\%} in the BioMe Biobank and by 9{\%} in the UK Biobank. The EHR score reclassified 25.8{\%} and 15.2{\%} individuals in each cohort respectively, compared with the PCE score. We observed larger improvements in the EHR score over the PCE in a subgroup of individuals with low CAD risk, with 20{\%} increased discrimination and 34.4{\%} increased reclassification. In all models, the polygenic risk score for CAD did not improve CAD prediction, compared with the PCE or EHR score. Conclusions: The EHR score resulted in increased prediction and reclassification for CAD, demonstrating its potential use for population health monitoring of short-term CAD risk in large health systems.},

OBJECTIVES: To examine whether newer HRV analysis algorithms, as used by the HeartTrends device, are superior to exercise stress testing (EST) for the detection of myocardial ischemia in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: We present pilot data of the first 100 subjects enrolled in a clinical trial designed to evaluate the yield of short-term (1 hour) HRV testing for the detection of myocardial ischemia. The study population comprised subjects without known CAD referred to a tertiary medical center for EST with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). All patients underwent a 1 hour electrocardiographic acquisition for HRV analysis with a HeartTrends device prior to ESTwith MPI. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) were calculated for EST and HRV analysis, using MPI as the gold standard for the non-invasive detection of myocardial ischemia. RESULTS: In this cohort 15{\%} had a pathologic MPI result. HRV analysis showed superior sensitivity (85{\%}), PPV (50{\%}) and NPV (97{\%}) as compared to standard EST (53{\%}, 42{\%}, 90{\%}, respectively), while the specificity of the two tests was similar (86{\%} and 85{\%}, respectively). The close agreement between HRV and MPI was even more pronounced among patients {\textgreater} 65 years of age.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has become the single most important and largest cause of NCD deaths worldwide at over 50{\%}. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 17.6 million people died of CVD worldwide in 2012. Proportionally, this accounts for an estimated 31.43{\%} of global mortality, with ischaemic heart disease (IHD) accounting for approximately 7.4 million deaths, 13.2{\%} of the total. IHD was also the greatest single cause of death in 2000, accounting for an estimated 6.0 million deaths. The global burden of CVD falls, principally, on the low and middle-income (LMI) countries, accounting for over 80{\%} of CVD deaths. Individual populations face differing challenges and each population has unique health burdens, however, CVD remains one of the greatest health challenges both nationally and worldwide.},

abstract = {The intrinsic cardiac nervous system has been classically considered to contain only parasympathetic efferent postganglionic neurones which receive inputs from medullary parasympathetic efferent preganglionic neurones. In such a view, intrinsic cardiac ganglia act as simple relay stations of parasympathetic efferent neuronal input to the heart, the major autonomic control of the heart purported to reside solely in the brainstem and spinal cord. Data collected over the past two decades indicate that processing occurs within the mammalian intrinsic cardiac nervous system which involves afferent neurones, local circuit neurones (interconnecting neurones) as well as both sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent postganglionic neurones. As such, intrinsic cardiac ganglionic interactions represent the organ component of the hierarchy of intrathoracic nested feedback control loops which provide rapid and appropriate reflex coordination of efferent autonomic neuronal outflow to the heart. In such a concept, the intrinsic cardiac nervous system acts as a distributive processor, integrating parasympathetic and sympathetic efferent centrifugal information to the heart in addition to centripetal information arising from cardiac sensory neurites. A number of neurochemicals have been shown to influence the interneuronal interactions which occur within the intrathoracic cardiac nervous system. For instance, pharmacological interventions that modify b-adrenergic or angiotensin II receptors affect cardiomyocyte function not only directly, but indirectly by influencing the capacity of intrathoracic neurones to regulate cardiomyocytes. Thus, current pharmacological management of heart disease may influence cardiomyocyte function directly as well as indirectly secondary to modifying the cardiac nervous system. This review presents a brief summary of developing concepts about the role of the cardiac nervous system in regulating the normal heart. In addition, it provides some tentative ideas concerning the importance of this nervous system in cardiac disease states with a view to stimulating further interest in neural control of the heart so that appropriate neurocardiological strategies can be devised for the management of heart disease.},

abstract = {The intravenous infusion of adenosine provokes anginalike chest pain. To establish its origin, an intracoronary infusion of increasing adenosine concentrations was given in 22 patients with stable angina pectoris. During adenosine infusion, 20 patients had chest pain without electrocardiographic signs of ischemia. They all reported that the chest pain was similar to their usual anginal pain. In 10 of the 22 patients adenosine was also infused into the right atrium, but it never produced symptoms at the doses that had provoked chest pain during intracoronary infusion. In seven other patients, the intracoronary adenosine infusion was repeated after intravenous administration of aminophylline, an antagonist of adenosine P1-receptors. Aminophylline decreased the severity of adenosine-induced chest pain (assessed with a visual analog scale) from 42 +/- 22 to 23 +/- 17 mm (p less than 0.002). In the remaining five of the 22 patients, monitoring of blood oxygen saturation in the coronary sinus during intracoronary adenosine administration showed that maximum coronary vasodilation was achieved at doses lower than those responsible for chest pain. A single-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of the effect of aminophylline on exercise-induced chest pain was also performed in 20 other patients with stable angina. Aminophylline, compared with placebo, decreased the severity of chest pain at peak exercise from 67 +/- 21 to 51 +/- 23 mm (p less than 0.02), despite the achievement of a similar degree of ST-segment depression. Finally, the effect of intravenous adenosine was compared in 10 patients with predominantly painful myocardial ischemia and in 10 patients with predominantly silent ischemia.},

abstract = {Objectives: This study sought to examine the relationship between inflammation and coronary microvascular function in asymptomatic individuals using positron emission tomography (PET) and assessment of coronary flow reserve (CFR). Background: Coronary microvascular dysfunction is an early precursor of coronary artery disease (CAD) thought to result from endothelial cell activation and inflammation, but data are limited. Methods: We examined 268 asymptomatic male monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Plasma biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial cell activation included C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, white blood cell count (WBC), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. Blood flow quantitation was obtained with [13N] ammonia PET at rest and after adenosine stress. CFR was measured as the ratio of maximum flow to baseline flow at rest; abnormal CFR was defined as a ratio {\textless}2.5. A summed stress score for visible perfusion defects was calculated. Results: In within-pair analyses, all biomarkers, except VCAM-1, were higher in twins with lower CFR than their brothers with higher CFR (p {\textless} 0.05). This was observed in the entire sample, as well as within pairs discordant for a CFR of {\textless}2.5. Associations persisted after adjusting for summed stress score and CAD risk factors. In contrast no biomarker, except IL-6, was related to the summed stress score of visible defects. Conclusions: Even in asymptomatic subjects, a decrease in coronary microvascular function is accompanied by a systemic inflammatory response, independent of CAD risk factors. Our results, using a controlled twin design, highlight the importance of coronary microvascular function in the early phases of CAD. {\textcopyright} 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

These associations were noted in men and women, old and young, and in all regions of the world. Collectively, these nine risk factors accounted for 90{\%} of the PAR in men and 94{\%} in women. Interpretation Abnormal lipids, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, abdominal obesity, psychosocial factors, consumption of fruits, vegetables, and alcohol, and regular physical activity account for most of the risk of myocardial infarction worldwide in both sexes and at all ages in all regions. This finding suggests that approaches to prevention can be based on similar principles worldwide and have the potential to prevent most premature cases of myocardial infarction.},
