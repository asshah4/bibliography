abstract = {This Journal feature begins with a case vignette highlighting a common clinical problem. Evidence supporting various strategies is then presented, followed by a review of formal guidelines, when they exist. The article ends with the author's clinical recommendations. A 50-year-old woman with bipolar depression presents with a widespread pruritic rash of 1 day's duration. She is afebrile and otherwise well. She has a history of child-hood eczema and is allergic to sulfonamide antibiotics. Her medications include thy-roxine daily, naproxen intermittently, and lamotrigine, which she began taking 3 weeks earlier. How should this case be evaluated and treated? The Cl inic a l Probl em In the United States, patients fill more than 300 million drug prescriptions and purchase millions of over-the-counter medications each month. 1 In many cases patients are using these medications for the first time. Cutaneous reactions are among the most common adverse effects of drugs, including penicillins, cephalo-sporins, sulfonamide antimicrobial agents, and allopurinol (with an incidence of up to 50 cases per 1000 new users), and particularly the aromatic amine antiseizure medications, including carbamazepine, phenytoin, and lamotrigine (with an inci-dence of up to 100 cases per 1000 new users). 2-7 Drug-related rash is reported for nearly all prescription medications, usually at rates exceeding 10 cases per 1000 new users. These reactions can range from asymptomatic mild eruptions to life-threaten-ing conditions. Cutaneous reactions may be difficult to distinguish from common rashes that are unrelated to medication use, particularly viral exanthems. Exanthematous drug eruptions (also called morbilliform or maculopapular drug eruptions) are the most common drug-induced eruptions. 2,7 They and the much rarer and more serious Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) are idiosyncratic, T-cell–mediated, delayed (type IV) hypersensitivity reactions. 8-11 Classically, antigen-presenting cells present haptens, composed of the drug or its metabolite bound to a protein or peptide, to naive T cells. These antigen-specific T cells proliferate, infiltrate the skin, and release cytokines, chemokines, and other proinflammatory mediators that are responsible for the signs and symptoms of the drug-related rash. 12-15 According to an alternative theory known as the p-i (pharmacologic interaction of drugs with immune receptors) concept, small-molecule drugs or their metabolites, which are not complete antigens, activate T cells directly by binding to T-cell receptors. 12,13},
