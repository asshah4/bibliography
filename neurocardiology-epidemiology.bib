abstract = {Twin studies have long been recognized for their value in learning about the aetiology of disease and specifically for their potential for separating genetic effects from environmental effects. The recent upsurge of interest in life-course epidemiology and the study of developmental influences on later health has provided a new impetus to study twins as a source of unique insights. Twins are of special interest because they provide naturally matched pairs where the confounding effects of a large number of potentially causal factors (such as maternal nutrition or gestation length) may be removed by comparisons between twins who share them. The traditional tool of epidemiological ‘risk factor analysis' is the regression model, but it is not straightforward to transfer standard regression methods to twin data, because the analysis needs to reflect the paired structure of the data, which induces correlation between twins. This paper reviews the use of more specialized regression methods for twin data, based on generalized least squares or linear mixed models, and explains the relationship between these methods and the commonly used approach of analysing within-twin-pair difference values. Methods and issues of interpretation are illustrated using an example from a recent study of the association between birth weight and cord blood erythropoietin. We focus on the analysis of continuous outcome measures but review additional complexities that arise with binary outcomes. We recommend the use of a general model that includes separate regression coefficients for within-twin-pair and between-pair effects, and provide guidelines for the interpretation of estimates obtained under this model.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Electric excitation initiates myocardial mechanical contraction and coordinates myocardial pumping. We hypothesized that ECG global electric heterogeneity (GEH) and its longitudinal changes are associated with cardiac structure and function. METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants from the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) (N=5114; 58{\%} female; 22{\%} blacks) with resting 12-lead ECGs (visits 1-5) and echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, LV global longitudinal strain, LV mass index, LV end-diastolic volume index, and LV end-systolic volume index at visit 5 were included. Longitudinal analysis included ARIC participants (N=14 609) with measured GEH at visits 1 to 4. GEH was quantified by spatial ventricular gradient, QRS-T angle, and sum absolute QRS-T integral. Cross-sectional and longitudinal regressions were adjusted for manifest and subclinical cardiovascular disease. Having 4 abnormal GEH parameters was associated with a 6.4{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 5.5-7.3) LV ejection fraction decline, a 24.2 g/m(2) (95{\%} confidence interval, 21.5-26.9) increase in LV mass index, a 10.3 mL/m(2) (95{\%} confidence interval, 8.9-11.7) increase in LV end-diastolic volume index, and a 7.8 mL/m(2) (95{\%} confidence interval, 6.9-8.6) increase in LV end-systolic volume index. Altogether, clinical and ECG parameters accounted for approximately one third of LV volume and 20{\%} of systolic function variability. The associations were significantly stronger in cardiovascular disease. Sum absolute QRS-T integral increased by 20 mV*ms for each 3-year period in participants who demonstrated LV dilatation at visit 5. Sudden cardiac death victims demonstrated rapid GEH worsening, whereas those with LV dysfunction demonstrated slow GEH worsening. Healthy aging was associated with a distinct pattern of spatial ventricular gradient azimuth decrement. CONCLUSIONS: GEH is a marker of subclinical abnormalities in cardiac structure and function.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature. Purpose: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) improve survival of systolic heart failure (HF) patients who are at risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). We recently showed that electrocardiographic (ECG) global electrical heterogeneity (GEH) is independently associated with SCD in the community-dwelling cohort and developed GEH SCD risk score. The Global Electrical Heterogeneity and Clinical Outcomes (GEHCO) study is a retrospective multicenter cohort designed with two goals: (1) validate an independent association of ECG GEH with sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias and appropriate ICD therapies and (2) validate GEH ECG risk score for prediction of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias and appropriate ICD therapies in systolic HF patients with primary prevention ICD. Methods: All records of primary prevention ICD recipients with available data for analysis are eligible for inclusion. Records of ICD implantation in patients with inherited channelopathies and cardiomyopathies are excluded. Raw digital 12-lead pre-implant ECGs will be used to measure GEH (spatial QRST angle, spatial ventricular gradient magnitude, azimuth, and elevation, and sum absolute QRST integral). The primary endpoint is defined as a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia event with appropriate ICD therapy. All-cause death without preceding sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia with appropriate ICD therapy will serve as a primary competing outcome. The study will draw data from the academic medical centers. Results: We describe the study protocol of the first multicenter retrospective cohort of primary prevention ICD patients with recorded at baseline digital 12-lead ECG. Conclusion: Findings from this study will inform future trials to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from primary prevention ICD. Trial registration: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT03210883.},

abstract = {The construct validity and the test-retest reliability of a self-administered questionnaire about habitual physical activity were investigated in young males (n = 139) and females (n = 167) in three age groups (20 to 22, 25 to 27, and 30 to 32 yr) in a Dutch population. By principal components analysis three conceptually meaningful factors were distinguished. They were interpreted as: 1) physical activity at work; 2) sport during leisure time; and 3) physical activity during leisure time excluding sport. Test-retest showed that the reliability of the three indices constructed from these factors was adequate. Further, it was found that level of education was inversely related to the work index, and positively related to the leisure-time index in both sexes. The subjective experience of work load was not related to the work index, but was inversely related to the sport index, and the leisure-time index in both sexes. The lean body mass was positively related the the work index, and the sport index in males, but was not related to the leisure-time index in either sex. These differences in the relationships support the subdivision of habitual physical activity into the three components mentioned above.},
