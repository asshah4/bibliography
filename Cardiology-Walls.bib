abstract = {Reverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and recovery of LV function are associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. A growing body of evidence suggests that even among patients who experience a complete normalization of LV ejection fraction, a significant proportion will develop recurrent LV dysfunction accompanied by recurrent heart failure events. This has led to intense interest in understanding how to manage patients with heart failure with recovered ejection fraction (HFrecEF). Because of the lack of a standard definition for HFrecEF, and the paucity of clinical data with respect to the natural history of HFrecEF patients, there are no current guidelines on how these patients should be followed up and managed. Accordingly, this JACC Scientific Expert Panel reviews the biology of reverse LV remodeling and the clinical course of patients with HFrecEF, as well as provides guidelines for defining, diagnosing, and managing patients with HFrecEF.},

abstract = {Routine cardiac catheterization provides data on left heart, right heart, systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures, vascular resistances, cardiac output, and ejection fraction. These data are often then applied as markers of cardiac preload, afterload, and global function, although each of these parameters reflects more complex interactions between the heart and its internal and external loads. This article reviews more specific gold standard assessments of ventricular and arterial properties, and how these relate to the parameters reported and utilized in practice, and then discusses the re-emerging importance of invasive hemodynamics in the assessment and management of heart failure. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In broad terms, “advanced” heart failure describes a clinical syndrome characterized by persistent or progressive symptoms and ventricular dysfunction despite guideline-directed medical therapy. Clinically the definition is often dependent upon iterative and integrated clinical assessments to identify patients with worsening status and reliance on specific therapies. This review examines current consensus definitions, highlights strategies for risk stratification and prognostication, and examines short- and long-term treatment strategies. Lastly, this paper explores future directions of research and development for the field.},

@article{Felker2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Loop diuretics are an essential component of therapy for patients with acute decompensated heart failure, but there are few prospective data to guide their use. METHODS: In a prospective, double-blind, randomized trial, we assigned 308 patients with acute decompensated heart failure to receive furosemide administered intravenously by means of either a bolus every 12 hours or continuous infusion and at either a low dose (equivalent to the patient's previous oral dose) or a high dose (2.5 times the previous oral dose). The protocol allowed specified dose adjustments after 48 hours. The coprimary end points were patients' global assessment of symptoms, quantified as the area under the curve (AUC) of the score on a visual-analogue scale over the course of 72 hours, and the change in the serum creatinine level from baseline to 72 hours. RESULTS: In the comparison of bolus with continuous infusion, there was no significant difference in patients' global assessment of symptoms (mean AUC, 4236±1440 and 4373±1404, respectively; P = 0.47) or in the mean change in the creatinine level (0.05±0.3 mg per deciliter [4.4±26.5 ?mol per liter] and 0.07±0.3 mg per deciliter [6.2±26.5 $\mu$mol per liter], respectively; P = 0.45). In the comparison of the high-dose strategy with the low-dose strategy, there was a nonsignificant trend toward greater improvement in patients' global assessment of symptoms in the high-dose group (mean AUC, 4430±1401 vs. 4171±1436; P = 0.06). There was no significant difference between these groups in the mean change in the creatinine level (0.08±0.3 mg per deciliter [7.1±26.5 $\mu$mol per liter] with the high-dose strategy and 0.04±0.3 mg per deciliter [3.5±26.5 $\mu$mol per liter] with the low-dose strategy, P = 0.21). The high-dose strategy was associated with greater diuresis and more favorable outcomes in some secondary measures but also with transient worsening of renal function. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with acute decompensated heart failure, there were no significant differences in patients' global assessment of symptoms or in the change in renal function when diuretic therapy was administered by bolus as compared with continuous infusion or at a high dose as compared with a low dose.
