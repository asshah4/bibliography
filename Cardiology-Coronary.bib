@article{McFalls2004,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The benefit of coronary-artery revascularization before elective major vascular surgery is unclear. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients at increased risk for perioperative cardiac complications and clinically significant coronary artery disease to undergo either revascularization or no revascularization before elective major vascular surgery. The primary end point was long-term mortality. RESULTS: Of 5859 patients scheduled for vascular operations at 18 Veterans Affairs medical centers, 510 (9 percent) were eligible for the study and were randomly assigned to either coronary-artery revascularization before surgery or no revascularization before surgery. The indications for a vascular operation were an expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm (33 percent) or arterial occlusive disease of the legs (67 percent). Among the patients assigned to preoperative coronary-artery revascularization, percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 59 percent, and bypass surgery was performed in 41 percent. The median time from randomization to vascular surgery was 54 days in the revascularization group and 18 days in the group not undergoing revascularization (P{\textless}0.001). At 2.7 years after randomization, mortality in the revascularization group was 22 percent and in the no-revascularization group 23 percent (relative risk, 0.98; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.70 to 1.37; P=0.92). Within 30 days after the vascular operation, a postoperative myocardial infarction, defined by elevated troponin levels, occurred in 12 percent of the revascularization group and 14 percent of the no-revascularization group (P=0.37). CONCLUSIONS: Coronary-artery revascularization before elective vascular surgery does not significantly alter the long-term outcome. On the basis of these data, a strategy of coronary-artery revascularization before elective vascular surgery among patients with stable cardiac symptoms cannot be recommended.

@misc{Taqueti2018,
abstract = {Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) refers to the subset of disorders affecting the structure and function of the coronary microcirculation, is prevalent in patients across a broad spectrum of cardiovascular risk factors, and is associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Contemporary evidence supports that most patients with CMD also have macrovessel atherosclerosis, which has important implications for their prognosis and management. In this state-of-the-art review, the authors summarize the pathophysiology of CMD, provide an update of diagnostic testing strategies, and classify CMD into phenotypes according to severity and coexistence with atherosclerosis. They examine emerging data highlighting the significance of CMD in specific populations, including obesity and insulin resistance, myocardial injury and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and nonobstructive and obstructive coronary artery disease. Finally, they discuss the role of CMD as a potential target for novel interventions beyond conventional approaches, representing a new frontier in cardiovascular disease reduction.},
