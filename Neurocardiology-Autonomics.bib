abstract = {Neural elements of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system transduce sensory inputs from the heart, blood vessels and other organs to ensure adequate cardiac function on a beat-to-beat basis. This inter-organ crosstalk is critical for normal function of the heart and other organs; derangements within the nervous system hierarchy contribute to pathogenesis of organ dysfunction. The role of intact cardiac nerves in development of, as well as protection against, ischemic injury is of current interest since it may involve recruitment of intrinsic cardiac ganglia. For instance, ischemic conditioning, a novel protection strategy against organ injury, and in particular remote conditioning, is likely mediated by activation of neural pathways or by endogenous cytoprotective blood-borne substances that stimulate different signalling pathways. This discovery reinforces the concept that inter-organ communication, and maintenance thereof, is key. As such, greater understanding of mechanisms and elucidation of treatment strategies is imperative to improve clinical outcomes particularly in patients with comorbidities. For instance, autonomic imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system regulation can initiate cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy that compromises cardiac stability and function. Neuromodulation therapies that directly target the intrinsic cardiac nervous system or other elements of the nervous system hierarchy are currently being investigated for treatment of different maladies in animal and human studies.},

abstract = {We tested the hypotheses that (1) progression of coronary artery disease (CAD) increases sympathetic inflow to the heart, thus impairing cardiac blood supply, and (2) reduced sympathetic tone improves cardiac microcirculation and ameliorates severity of anginal symptoms. Electrical irritation of the nerve auricularis-a sensitive ramus of the vagus nerve-provides a central sympatholytic action. Using this technique, we studied the effects of vagal neurostimulation (VNS) on hemodynamics, the content of atrial noradrenergic nerves and the microcirculatory bed of CAD patients. VNS was performed in the preoperative period of CAD patients with severe angina pectoris. The comparison groups consisted of untreated patients with CAD or Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Atrial tissue of patients with this syndrome (n=6); with effort angina (n=14); with angina at rest (n=10); and with severe angina treated with VNS (n=8) contained the following volume percentages of noradrenergic nerves: 1.7±0.1{\%}, 1.3±0.3{\%}, 0.5±0.1{\%} (p{\textless}0.05 vs. the other groups) and 1.3±0.2{\%}, respectively. In these groups, cardiac microcirculatory vessels (diameter, 10-20 $\mu$m) had the following densities: 2.7±0.2{\%}, 3.4±0.2{\%}, 2.0±0.4{\%} (p{\textless}0.05 vs. the other groups) and 3.3±0.3{\%}, respectively. VNS treatment abolished angina at rest, decreased heart rate and blood pressure. It improved left ventricular ejection fraction from 50±1.5{\%} to 58±1.0{\%} (p{\textless}0.05), also changing left ventricular diastolic filling. The ratio of time velocity integrals of the early (Ei) to late (Ai) waves increased from 1.07±0.12 to 1.65±0.17 after VNS (p{\textless}0.05). In electrocardiograms of VNS-treated patients, QRS- and QT-duration were shortened, the PQ-interval did not change, but T-wave configuration improved. In the postoperative period, heart failure occurred in 90{\%} of the control group, vs. 12{\%} in patients treated with VNS (p{\textless}0.05). We conclude that CAD is characterized by overactivity of sympathetic cardiac tone. Vagal stimulation reduced sympathetic inflow to the heart, seemingly via an inhibition of norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves. VNS' sympatholytic/vagotonic action dilated cardiac microcirculatory vessels and improved left ventricular contractility in patients with severe CAD.

abstract = {We hypothesized that selective control of ventricular contractility might be mediated by postganglionic parasympathetic neurons in the cranial medial ventricular (CMV) ganglion plexus located in a fat pad at the base of the aorta. Sinus rate, atrioventricular (AV) conduction (ventricular rate during atrial pacing), and left ventricular contractile force (LV dP/dt during right ventricular pacing) were measured in eight chloralose-anesthetized dogs both before and during bilateral cervical vagus stimulation (20-30 V, 0.5 ms pulses, 15-20 Hz). Seven of these dogs were tested under beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol, 0.8 mg kg -1 i.v.). Control responses included sinus node bradycardia or arrest during spontaneous rhythm, high grade AV block or complete heart block, and a 30{\%} decrease in contractility from 2118 ± 186 to 1526 ± 187 mm Hg s -1 (P {\textless} 0.05). Next, the ganglionic blocker trimethaphan (0.3-1.0 ml of a 50 $\mu$g ml -1 solution) was injected into the CMV fat pad. Then vagal stimulation was repeated, which now produced a relatively small 5{\%} (N.S., P {\textgreater} 0.05) decrease in contractility but still elicited the same degree of sinus bradycardia and AV block (N = 8, P {\textless} 0.05). Five dogs were re-tested 3 h after trimethaphan fat pad injection, at which time blockade of vagally-induced negative inotropy was partially reversed, as vagal stimulation decreased LV dP/dt by 19{\%}. The same dose of trimethaphan given either locally into other fat pads (PVFP or IVC-ILA) or systemically (i.v.) had no effect on vagally-induced negative inotropy. Thus, parasympathetic ganglia located in the CMV fat pad mediated a decrease in ventricular contractility during vagal stimulation. Blockade of the CMV fat pad had no effect on vagally-mediated slowing of sinus rate or AV conduction.},

abstract = {In 18 dogs on total cardiopulmonary bypass, the average interval between local activations during artificially induced ventricular fibrillation (VF interval) was measured from extracellular electrograms, simultaneously recorded from up to 32 ventricular sites. VF intervals were used as an index of local refractoriness, based on the assumption that during ventricular fibrillation, cells are reexcited as soon as they have recovered their excitability. In support of this, microelectrode recordings in two hearts during ventricular fibrillation did not show a diastolic interval between successive action potentials. Refractory periods determined at a basic cycle length of 300 msec with the extrastimulus method correlated well with VF intervals measured at the same sites. Thus, this technique allows assessment of spatial dispersion of refractoriness during brief interventions such as sympathetic stimulation. The responses to left, right, and combined stellate ganglion stimulation varied substantially among individual hearts. This was observed both in dogs with an intact (n = 12) and decentralized (n = 6) autonomic nervous system. Individual ventricular sites could show effects of both left and right stellate ganglion stimulation (42{\%} of tested sites) or show effects of left-sided stimulation only (31{\%}) or right-sided stimulation only (14{\%}). In 13{\%} of sites, no effects of stellate stimulation were observed. Apart from these regional effects, the responses could be qualitatively different; that is, within the same heart, the VF interval prolonged at one site but shortened at another in response to the same intervention, although shortening was the general effect and prolongation the exception. Whenever sites responded to stellate ganglion stimulation with a shortening of VF interval, this shortening was approximately 10{\%} for left, right, or combined stimulation, whether the autonomic nervous system was intact or decentralized. In six of 12 hearts in the intact group, there was a distinct regional effect of left stellate ganglion stimulation; in the other six hearts, the effects were distributed homogeneously over the ventricles. In three hearts, the effect of left stellate ganglion stimulation was strongest in the posterior wall, and in the other three hearts, in the anterior wall. The effects of right stellate ganglion stimulation were restricted to the anterior or lateral part of the left ventricle. Dispersion of VF intervals increased after left and combined stellate ganglion stimulation in the intact group and after right stellate ganglion stimulation in the decentralized group, but not significantly in every heart. This points to a marked individual variation with regard to the effects of sympathetic stimulation on electrophysiological properties of the heart.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effects of unilateral stellate ganglion blockade on left ventricular function. DESIGN Prospective cohort of patients with chronic regional pain syndrome type I and II of the upper extremity requiring therapeutic stellate ganglion blockade. SETTING University-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS Fifteen adult ASA physical status I and II patients with the diagnosis of chronic regional pain syndrome type I and II of the arm were studied. Right stellate ganglion block was performed in nine subjects and a left in six. INTERVENTIONS Stellate ganglion block was performed with 10 mL of 1{\%} plain Xylocaine. Transthoracic echocardiograms were performed immediately prior and 30 min following the block. MEASUREMENTS Heart rate and blood pressure were monitored at regular intervals. Global systolic function was determined by calculating ejection fraction. Regional systolic motion was evaluated on the short axis and four-chamber views using the American Society of Echocardiography criteria. Diastolic function was assessed with pulsed-wave Doppler of the left ventricular outflow tract and the mitral valve. Data collected included isovolumic relaxation time and early and atrial velocity patterns. MAIN RESULTS A successful stellate ganglion block was achieved in all patients. Blood pressure and heart rate were not significantly different during data collection. Patients who underwent a right stellate ganglion block showed no significant differences in systolic or diastolic function. Following a left stellate ganglion block, global and regional systolic function remained unchanged. Isovolumic relaxation time was increased but did not reach statistical significance (80 +/- 13 ms to 88 +/- 9 ms; p = 0.09). Left ventricular end-diastolic (LVEDV) and end-systolic volumes (LVESV) were significantly increased (LVEDV from 73 +/- 9 mL to 100 +/- 9 mL, p {\textless} 0.02; LVESV from 31 +/- 4 mL to 37 +/- 4 mL, p {\textless} 0.03). CONCLUSIONS In patients without cardiovascular disease, unilateral denervation of the left ventricle after stellate ganglion block produces no clinical deleterious effects on left ventricular function.},

abstract = {Cardiac sympathetic denervation for intractable angina pectoris in patients unsuitable for conventional revascularization is currently gaining popularity since this procedure may be performed via minimally invasive surgery. A thorough understanding of cardiac innervation and its variations is crucial to successfully effect cardiac denervation. This study aimed to demonstrate the cervical and thoracic sympathetic contributions to the cardiac plexus. The cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunks in 21 fetuses and eight adults were micro-dissected bilaterally and documented ( n=58 sides). The superior cervical cardiac ramus originated from the superior cervical ganglion (present in all specimens) in 53{\%} of cases. The middle cervical ganglion (incidence 81{\%}) gave rise to the middle cervical cardiac ramus in 88{\%} of cases. The cervico-thoracic ganglion (incidence 85{\%}) gave the cervico-thoracic cardiac ramus in 84{\%}. In the thoracic region, four cardiac rami arose from the T2-T6 segment of the thoracic sympathetic trunk. All cervical and thoracic cardiac rami were traced consistently to the deep cardiac plexus. Khogali et al.'s (1999) success of limited T2-T4 sympathectomy in relieving pain at rest of patients with intractable angina pectoris appears to indicate that a significant afferent pain pathway from the heart is selectively interrupted. The variability in pattern of the cervical ganglia, cardiac rami and cervical contributions to the cardiac plexus does not appear to affect the outcome of limited sympathectomy. The complexity of cardiac pain pathways is not fully understood. The study is continuing and attempts to contribute to defining these cardiac neuronal pathways.},

abstract = {Autonomic dysregulation in cardiovascular disease plays a major role in the pathogenesis of arrhythmias. Cardiac neural control relies on complex feedback loops consisting of efferent and afferent limbs, which carry sympathetic and parasympathetic signals from the brain to the heart and sensory signals from the heart to the brain. Cardiac disease leads to neural remodeling and sympathovagal imbalances with arrhythmogenic effects. Preclinical studies of modulation at central and peripheral levels of the cardiac autonomic nervous system have yielded promising results, leading to early stage clinical studies of these techniques in atrial fibrillation and refractory ventricular arrhythmias, particularly in patients with inherited primary arrhythmia syndromes and structural heart disease. However, significant knowledge gaps in basic cardiac neurophysiology limit the success of these neuromodulatory therapies. This review discusses the recent advances in neuromodulation for cardiac arrhythmia management, with a clinical scenario-based approach aimed at bringing neurocardiology closer to the realm of the clinical electrophysiologist.},

abstract = {This study was prompted by the prospect of transgenic pigs providing donor hearts for transplantation in human recipients. Autonomic innervation is important for the control of cardiac dynamics, especially in the conduction system. Our objective was to assess the relative distribution of autonomic nerves in the pig heart, focusing initially on the conduction system but addressing also the myocardium, endocardium and epicardium (see Crick et al. 1999). Quantitative immunohistochemical and histochemical techniques were adopted. All regions of the conduction system possessed a significantly higher relative density of the total neural population immunoreactive for the general neuronal marker protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) than did the adjacent myocardium. A similar density of PGP 9.5-immunoreactive innervation was observed between the sinus node, the transitional region of the atrioventricular node, and the penetrating atrioventricular bundle. A differential pattern of PGP 9.5-immunoreactive innervation was present within the atrioventricular node and between the components of the ventricular conduction tissues, the latter being formed by an intricate network of Purkinje fibres. Numerous ganglion cell bodies were present in the peripheral regions of the sinus node, in the tissues of the atrioventricular groove, and even in the interstices of the compact atrioventricular node. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-containing nerves were the dominant subpopulation observed, representing 60-70{\%} of the total pattern of innervation in the nodal tissues and penetrating atrioventricular bundle. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive nerves were the next most abundant neural subpopulation, representing 37{\%} of the total pattern of innervation in the compact atrioventricular node compared with 25{\%} in the transitional nodal region. A minor population of ganglion cell bodies within the atrioventricular nodal region displayed TH immunoreactivity. The dominant peptidergic nerve supply possessed immunoreactivity for neuropeptide Y (NPY), which displayed a similar pattern of distribution to that of TH-immunoreactive nerve fibres. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-immunoreactive nerves represented 8-9{\%} of the total innervation of the nodal tissues and penetrating atrioventricular bundle, increasing to 14-19{\%} in the bundle branches. Somatostatin-immunoreactive nerve fibres were relatively sparse (4-13{\%} of total innervation) and were most abundant in the nodes, especially the compact atrioventricular node. The total pattern of innervation of the porcine conduction system was relatively homogeneous. A substantial proportion of nerve fibres innervating the nodal tissues could be traced to intracardiac ganglia indicative of an extensive intrinsic supply. The innervation of the atrioventricular node and ventricular conduction tissues was similar to that observed in the bovine heart, but markedly different to that of the human heart. It is important that we are aware of these findings in view of the future use of transgenic pig hearts in human xenotransplantation.},

abstract = {Endurance exercise training promotes numerous cellular adaptations in both cardiac myocytes and skeletal muscle fibers. For example, exercise training fosters changes in mitochondrial function due to increased mitochondrial protein expression and accelerated mitochondrial turnover. Additionally, endurance exercise training alters the abundance of numerous cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins in both cardiac and skeletal muscle myocytes, resulting in a protective phenotype in the active fibers; this exercise-induced protection of cardiac and skeletal muscle fibers is often referred to as "exercise preconditioning." As few as 3-5 consecutive days of endurance exercise training result in a preconditioned cardiac phenotype that is sheltered against ischemia-reperfusion-induced injury. Similarly, endurance exercise training results in preconditioned skeletal muscle fibers that are resistant to a variety of stresses (e.g., heat stress, exercise-induced oxidative stress, and inactivity-induced atrophy). Many studies have probed the mechanisms responsible for exercise-induced preconditioning of cardiac and skeletal muscle fibers; these studies are important, because they provide an improved understanding of the biochemical mechanisms responsible for exercise-induced preconditioning, which has the potential to lead to innovative pharmacological therapies aimed at minimizing stress-induced injury to cardiac and skeletal muscle. This review summarizes the development of exercise-induced protection of cardiac myocytes and skeletal muscle fibers and highlights the putative mechanisms responsible for exercise-induced protection in the heart and skeletal muscles.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The extent and locations of intrinsic cardiac ganglia on the human heart were investigated to facilitate studying their function. METHODS: The locations and number of major intrinsic cardiac ganglia were determined in six human hearts by means of microdissection following methylene blue staining. Light and electron microscopic analyses were performed on right atrial and cranial medial ventricular ganglia obtained from 12 other human hearts. RESULTS: Gross anatomy: Collections of ganglia associated with nerves, i.e., ganglionated plexuses, were observed consistently in five atrial and five ventricular regions. Occasional ganglia were located in other atrial and ventricular regions. Atrial ganglionated plexuses were identified on 1) the superior surface of the right atrium, 2) the superior surface of the left atrium, 3) the posterior surface of the right atrium, 4) the posterior medial surface of the left atrium (the latter two fuse medially where they extend anteriorly into the interatrial septum), and 5) the inferior and lateral aspect of the posterior left atrium. Ventricular ganglionated plexuses were located in fat 1) surrounding the aortic root, 2) at the origins of the right and left coronary arteries (the latter extending to the origins of the left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries), 3) at the origin of the posterior descending coronary artery, 4) adjacent to the origin of the right acute marginal coronary artery, and 5) at the origin of the left obtuse marginal coronary artery. Microscopic anatomy: Ganglia ranged in size from those containing a few neurons to large ganglia measuring up to 0.5 x 1 mm. The human heart is estimated to contain more than 14,000 neurons. Neuronal somata varied in size and shape. Many axon terminals in intrinsic cardiac ganglia contained large numbers of small, clear, round vesicles that formed asymmetrical axodendritic synapses, whereas a few axons contained large, dense-cored vesicles. CONCLUSIONS: The human intrinsic cardiac nervous system is distributed more extensively than was considered previously, most of its ganglia being located on the posterior surfaces of the atria and superior aspect of the ventricles. Each ganglion therein contains a variety of neurons that are associated with complex synaptology.},

abstract = {The mouse heart is a popular model to study the function and autonomic control of the specialized cardiac conduction system (CCS). However, the precise identity and anatomical distribution of the intrinsic cardiac nerves that modulate the function of the mouse CCS have not been adequately studied. We aimed at determining the organization and distribution of the intrinsic cardiac nerves that supply the CCS of the mouse. In whole mouse heart preparations, intrinsic neural structures were revealed by histochemical staining for acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Adrenergic, cholinergic and peptidergic neural components were identified, respectively, by immunohistochemical labeling for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), and protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5). Myocytes of the CCS were identified by immunolabeling of hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel 4 (HCN4). In addition, the presence of CCS myocytes in atypical locations was verified using fluorescent immunohistochemistry performed on routine paraffin sections. The results demonstrate that four microscopic epicardial nerves orientated toward the sinuatrial nodal (SAN) region derive from both the dorsal right atrial and right ventral nerve subplexuses. The atrioventricular nodal (AVN) region is typically supplied by a single intrinsic nerve derived from the left dorsal nerve subplexus at the posterior interatrial groove. SAN myocytes positive for HCN4 were widely distributed both on the medial, anterior, lateral and even posterior sides of the root of the right cranial (superior caval) vein. The distribution of HCN4-positive myocytes in the AVN region was also wider than previously considered. HCN4-positive cells and thin slivers of the AVN extended to the roots of the ascending aorta, posteriorly to the orifice of the coronary sinus, and even along both atrioventricular rings. Notwithstanding the fact that cholinergic nerve fibers and axons clearly predominate in the mouse CCS, adrenergic nerve fibers and axons are abundant therein as well. Altogether, these results provide new insight into the anatomical basis of the neural control of the mouse CCS.},

abstract = {A very schematic summary of possible factors that affect coronary vascular resistance is illustrated in Fig. 11. These factors are mechanical, myogenic, metabolic, and neural.64 Mechanical influence is passive and is essentially determined by the extravascular compression which is important only during systole and particularly in the subendocardial layers of the left ventricular myocardium. With respect to the myogenic factor it is controversial whether it plays a role in adjustments of coronary vascular tone. Metabolic processes are possibly integrated at the level of the myocardial cell PO2 which is the resultant of oxygen supply and need, which in turn depend on the myocardial contractile activity as well as other biochemical processes. A decrease in myocardial PO2 gives rise to the release of the vasodilator metabolite adenosine. Nevertheless, other chemical factors (H+, K+, osmolarity) known to be released by the heart (which by themselves are poor and transient coronary vasodilators and whose release does not correspond with changes in coronary resistance) may play a role by modulating the coronary sensitivity to adenosine and other factors. {\textcopyright} 1975.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine how neurons within the right atrial ganglionated plexus (RAGP) and posterior atrial ganglionated plexus (PAGP) interact to modulate right atrial chronotropic, dromotropic, and inotropic function, particularly with respect to their extracardiac vagal and sympathetic efferent neuronal inputs. Surgical ablation of the PAGP (PAGPx) attenuated vagally mediated bradycardia by 26{\%}; it reduced heart rate slowing evoked by vagal stimulation superimposed on sympathetically mediated tachycardia by 36{\%}. RAGP ablation (RAGPx) eliminated vagally mediated bradycardia, while retaining the vagally induced suppression of sympathetic-mediated tachycardia (-83{\%}). After combined RAGPx and PAGPx, vagal stimulation still reduced sympathetic-mediated tachycardia (-47{\%}). After RAGPx alone and after PAGPx alone, stimulation of the vagi still produced negative dromotropic effects, although these changes were attenuated compared with the intact state. Negative dromotropic responses to vagal stimulation were further attenuated after combined ablation, but parasympathetic inhibition of atrioventricular nodal conduction was still demonstrable in most animals. Finally, neither RAGPx nor PAGPx altered autonomic regulation of right atrial inotropic function. These data indicate that multiple aggregates of neurons within the intrinsic cardiac nervous system are involved in sinoatrial nodal regulation. Whereas parasympathetic efferent neurons regulating the right atrium, including the sinoatrial node, are primarily located within the RAGP, prejunctional parasympathetic-sympathetic interactions regulating right atrial function also involve neurons within the PAGP.},

abstract = {Dysfunction of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system is implicated in the genesis of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. While this system has been studied extensively in animal models, far less is known about the intrinsic cardiac nervous system of humans. This study was initiated to anatomically identify neurotransmitters associated with the right atrial ganglionated plexus (RAGP) of the human heart. Biopsies of epicardial fat containing a portion of the RAGP were collected from eight patients during cardiothoracic surgery and processed for immunofluorescent detection of specific neuronal markers. Colocalization of markers was evaluated by confocal microscopy. Most intrinsic cardiac neuronal somata displayed immunoreactivity for the cholinergic marker choline acetyltransferase and the nitrergic marker neuronal nitric oxide synthase. A subpopulation of intrinsic cardiac neurons also stained for noradrenergic markers. While most intrinsic cardiac neurons received cholinergic innervation evident as punctate immunostaining for the high affinity choline transporter, some lacked cholinergic inputs. Moreover, peptidergic, nitrergic, and noradrenergic nerves provided substantial innervation of intrinsic cardiac ganglia. These findings demonstrate that the human RAGP has a complex neurochemical anatomy, which includes the presence of a dual cholinergic/nitrergic phenotype for most of its neurons, the presence of noradrenergic markers in a subpopulation of neurons, and innervation by a host of neurochemically distinct nerves. The putative role of multiple neurotransmitters in controlling intrinsic cardiac neurons and mediating efferent signaling to the heart indicates the possibility of novel therapeutic targets for arrhythmia prevention. {\textcopyright} 2009 IBRO.},

The paper has two objectives: first, to provide an explicit statement of the theory; and second, to introduce the features of a polyvagal perspective. The polyvagal perspective emphasizes how an understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms and phylogenetic shifts in neural regulation leads to different questions, paradigms, explanations, and conclusions regarding autonomic function in biobehavioral processes than peripheral models.

abstract = {There is continuing belief that cardiac parasympathetic postganglionic fibres are sparse or absent from the ventricles. This review of the literature shows that the supposition is a myth. Early studies considered that fine silver-stained fibres coursing amongst ventricle myocardial cells were most likely cardiac parasympathetic postganglionic fibres. The conclusions were later supported by acetyl cholinesterase staining using a method that appeared not to be associated with noradrenaline nerve fibres. The conclusion is critically examined in the light of several recent histological studies using the acetyl cholinesterase method and also a more definitive technique (CHAT), that suggest a widespread location of parasympathetic ganglia and a relatively dense parasympathetic innervation of ventricular muscle in a range of mammals including man. The many studies demonstrating acetylcholine release in the ventricle on vagal nerve stimulation and a high density of acetylcholine M2 receptors is in accord with this as are tests of ventricular performance from many physiological studies. Selective control of cardiac functions by anatomically segregated parasympathetic ganglia is discussed. It is argued that the influence of vagal stimulation on ventricular myocardial action potential refractory period, duration, force and rhythm is evidence that vagal fibres have close apposition to myocardial fibres. This is supported by clear evidence of accentuated antagonism between sympathetic activity and vagal activity in the ventricle and also by direct effects of vagal activity independent of sympathetic activity. The idea of differential control of atrial and ventricular physiology by vagal C and vagal B preganglionic fibres is examined as well as differences in chemical phenotypes and their function. The latter is reflected in medullary and supramedullary control. Reference is made to the importance of this knowledge to understanding the normal physiology of cardiac autonomic control and significance to pathology.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of atrial GP stimulation (GPS) on ventricular refractoriness, restitution properties and electrical alternans. Methods: In 12 anesthetized dogs, two multiple electrode catheters were sutured at left and right ventricular free walls for recording. Monophasic action potentials were recorded from six epicardial ventricular sites. Ventricular effective refractory period (ERP), action potential duration (APD) restitution properties and APD alternans were measured at baseline and during GPS. Results: Compared with baseline, GPS significantly prolonged ventricular ERP and APD at all sites and decreased their spatial dispersions (P {\textless} 0.05 for all). GPS also significantly flattened ventricular restitution curves and decreased the maximal slope of restitution curves at each site (P {\textless} 0.05 for all). APD alternans occurred at shorter pacing cycle length at each site during GPS when compared with baseline (P {\textless} 0.05 for all). Conclusions: GPS prolonged ventricular ERP, decreased the slope of restitution curves and delayed APD alternans, indicating that GPS may exert a protective role for ventricular arrhythmias. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Currently there is no description of an in vitro whole heart preparation for comparing the influence of each sympathetic supply on cardiac function. The aim was to establish the viability of using an in vitro model to investigate the effects of left and right sympathetic chain stimulation (LSS/RSS). For this purpose the upper sympathetic chain on each side was isolated and bipolar stimulating electrodes were attached between T2-T3 and electrically insulated from surrounding tissue in a Langendorff innervated rabbit heart preparation (n = 8). Heart rate (HR) was investigated during sinus rhythm, whilst dromotropic, inotropic and ventricular electrophysiological effects were measured during constant pacing (250. bpm). All responses exhibited linear increases with increases in stimulation frequency (2-10. Hz). The change in HR was larger during RSS than LSS (P. {\textless}. 0.01), increasing by 78. ±. 9. bpm and 49. ±. 8. bpm respectively (10. Hz, baseline; 145. ±. 7. bpm). Left ventricular pressure was increased from a baseline of 50. ±. 4. mm. Hg, by 22. ±. 5. mm. Hg (LSS, 10. Hz) and 4. ±. 1. mm. Hg (RSS, 10. Hz) respectively (P. {\textless}. 0.001). LSS, but not RSS, caused a shortening of basal and apical monophasic action potential duration (MAPD90). We demonstrate that RSS exerts a greater effect at the sinoatrial node and LSS at the left ventricle. The study confirms previous experiments on dogs and cats, provides quantitative data on the comparative influence of right and left sympathetic nerves and demonstrates the feasibility of isolating and stimulating the ipsilateral cardiac sympathetic supply in an in vitro innervated rabbit heart preparation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Multiple imaging studies of the presynaptic component have reported that those individuals with the lowest retention or fastest washout of the radiolabeled analogs have a much greater annual mortality than do those with greater retention or slower washout rate. The results of some studies have suggested that the image abnormalities are better predictors of death than are more common predictors of outcome such as ejection fraction, heart rate variability, and microvolt T-wave alternans. The variability between these studies makes it unclear which measure of presynaptic dysfunction is the most predictive. -Receptor imaging has not been evaluated as extensively as a prognostic tool as has presynaptic imaging.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Anatomical Society. The rabbit is widely used in experimental cardiac physiology, but the neuroanatomy of the rabbit heart remains insufficiently examined. This study aimed to ascertain the architecture of the intrinsic nerve plexus in the walls and septum of rabbit cardiac ventricles. In 51 rabbit hearts, a combined approach involving: (i) histochemical acetylcholinesterase staining of intrinsic neural structures in total cardiac ventricles; (ii) immunofluorescent labelling of intrinsic nerves, nerve fibres (NFs) and neuronal somata (NS); and (iii) transmission electron microscopy of intrinsic ventricular nerves and NFs was used. Mediastinal nerves access the ventral and lateral surfaces of both ventricles at a restricted site between the root of the ascending aorta and the pulmonary trunk. The dorsal surface of both ventricles is supplied by several epicardial nerves extending from the left dorsal ganglionated nerve subplexus on the dorsal left atrium. Ventral accessing nerves are thicker and more numerous than dorsal nerves. Intrinsic ventricular NS are rare on the conus arteriosus and the root of the pulmonary trunk. The number of ventricular NS ranged from 11 to 220 per heart. Four chemical phenotypes of NS within ventricular ganglia were identified, i.e. ganglionic cells positive for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and biphenotypic, i.e. positive for both ChAT/nNOS and for ChAT/tyrosine hydroxylase. Clusters of small intensely fluorescent cells are distributed within or close to ganglia on the root of the pulmonary trunk, but not on the conus arteriosus. The largest and most numerous intrinsic nerves proceed within the epicardium. Scarce nerves were found near myocardial blood vessels, but the myocardium contained only a scarce meshwork of NFs. In the endocardium, large numbers of thin nerves and NFs proceed along the bundle of His and both its branches up to the apex of the ventricles. The endocardial meshwork of fine NFs was approximately eight times denser than the myocardial meshwork. Adrenergic NFs predominate considerably in all layers of the ventricular walls and septum, whereas NFs of other neurochemical phenotypes were in the minority and their amount differed between the epicardium, myocardium and endocardium. The densities of NFs positive for nNOS and ChAT were similar in the epicardium and endocardium, but NFs positive for nNOS in the myocardium were eight times more abundant than NFs positive for ChAT. Potentially sensory NFs positive for both calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P were sparse in the myocardial layer, but numerous in epicardial nerves and particularly abundant within the endocardium. Electron microscopic observations demonstrate that intrinsic ventricular nerves have a distinctive morphology, which may be attributed to remodelling of the peripheral nerves after their access into the ventricular wall. In conclusion, the rabbit ventricles display complex structural organization of intrinsic ventricular nerves, NFs and ganglionic cells. The results provide a basic anatomical background for further functional analysis of the intrinsic nervous system in the cardiac ventricles.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Previous studies have documented abnormalities of arterial baroreflexes in animals and patients with congestive heart failure. This study determined whether cardiopulmonary reflex control of sympathetic nerve activity was abnormal in a canine model of low-output heart failure induced by rapid ventricular pacing. METHODS AND RESULTS We stimulated mechanoreceptors throughout the cardiopulmonary region by volume expansion and left atrial mechanoreceptors selectively by inflating small balloons at the junctions of the pulmonary veins and left atrium. Responses of renal sympathetic nerve activity and left atrial and systemic arterial pressures were recorded. In the control group, 15{\%} volume expansion raised left atrial pressure 3.5 +/- 0.8 mm Hg and resulted in a 70 +/- 8{\%} reduction in renal nerve activity. In the heart failure group, 15{\%} volume expansion resulted in a 6.8 +/- 3.0 mm Hg rise in left atrial pressure with only a 16 +/- 20{\%} reduction in renal nerve activity (p {\textless} 0.01). When volume expansion was performed after pretreatment with hemorrhage to lower left atrial pressure to the normal range in the heart failure group, the markedly attenuated response in the heart failure group persisted. After vagotomy, volume expansion elicited no change in renal nerve activity. Inflation of the atrial balloons caused a 28 +/- 9{\%} reduction in renal sympathetic nerve activity and a 13 +/- 4 mm Hg decrease in arterial pressure in the control group. Renal nerve activity (-5 +/- 3{\%}) and mean arterial pressure (-1 +/- 1 mm Hg) did not change with balloon inflation in the heart failure group. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that dogs with low-output heart failure exhibit marked attenuation of cardiopulmonary mechanoreflex control of sympathetic nerve activity. This attenuated response is mediated via cardiac vagal afferent fibers and is due to either abnormalities in cardiopulmonary baroreceptors or abnormalities in the central nervous system.},

abstract = {We have previously shown that direct vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) reduces the slope of action potential duration (APD) restitution while simultaneously protecting the heart against induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF) in the absence of any sympathetic activity or tone. In the current study we have examined the role of nitric oxide (NO) in the effect of VNS. Monophasic action potentials were recorded from a left ventricular epicardial site on innervated, isolated rabbit hearts (n = 7). Standard restitution, effective refractory period (ERP) and VF threshold (VFT) were measured at baseline and during VNS in the presence of the NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NA, 200 microm) and during reversing NO blockade with L-arginine (L-Arg, 1 mm). Data represent the mean +/- S.E.M. The restitution curve was shifted upwards and became less steep with VNS when compared to baseline. L-NA blocked the effect of VNS whereas L-Arg restored the effect of VNS. The maximum slope of restitution was reduced from 1.17 +/- 0.14 to 0.60 +/- 0.09 (50 +/- 5{\%}, P {\textless} 0.0001) during control, from 0.98 +/- 0.14 to 0.93 +/- 0.12 (2 +/- 10{\%}, P = NS) in the presence of L-NA and from 1.16 +/- 0.17 to 0.50 +/- 0.10 (41 +/- 9{\%}, P = 0.003) with L-Arg plus L-NA. ERP was increased by VNS in control from 119 +/- 6 ms to 130 +/- 6 ms (10 +/- 5{\%}, P = 0.045) and this increase was not affected by L-NA (120 +/- 4 to 133 +/- 4 ms, 11 +/- 3{\%}, P = 0.0019) or L-Arg with L-NA (114 +/- 4 to 123 +/- 4 ms, 8 +/- 2{\%}, P = 0.006). VFT was increased from 3.0 +/- 0.3 to 5.8 +/- 0.5 mA (98 +/- 12{\%}, P = 0.0017) in control, 3.4 +/- 0.4 to 3.8 +/- 0.5 mA (13 +/- 12{\%}, P = 0.6) during perfusion with L-NA and 2.5 +/- 0.4 to 6.0 +/- 0.7 mA (175 +/- 50{\%}, P = 0.0017) during perfusion with L-Arg plus L-NA. Direct VNS increased VFT and flattened the slope of APD restitution curve in this isolated rabbit heart preparation with intact autonomic nerves. These effects were blocked using L-NA and reversed by replenishing the substrate for NO production with L-Arg. This is the first study to demonstrate that NO plays an important role in the anti-fibrillatory effect of VNS on the rabbit ventricle, possibly via effects on APD restitution.},

abstract = {Homeostasis is a founding principle of integrative physiology. In current systems biology, however, homeostasis seems almost invisible. Is homeostasis a key goal driving body processes, or is it an emergent mechanistic fact? In this perspective piece, I propose that the integrative physiological and systems biological viewpoints about homeostasis reflect different epistemologies, different philosophies of knowledge. Integrative physiology is concept driven. It attempts to explain biological phenomena by continuous formation of theories that experimentation or observation can test. In integrative physiology, "function" refers to goals or purposes. Systems biology is data driven. It explains biological phenomena in terms of "omics"-i.e., genomics, gene expression, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics-it depicts the data in computer models of complex cascades or networks, and it makes predictions from the models. In systems biology, "function" refers more to mechanisms than to goals. The integrative physiologist emphasizes homeostasis of internal variables such as Pco2 and blood pressure. The systems biologist views these emphases as teleological and unparsimonious in that the "regulated variable" (e.g., arterial Pco2 and blood pressure) and the "regulator" (e.g., the "carbistat" and "barostat") are unobservable constructs. The integrative physiologist views systems biological explanations as not really explanations but descriptions that cannot account for phenomena we humans believe exist, although they cannot be observed directly, such as feelings and, ultimately, the conscious mind. This essay reviews the history of the two epistemologies, emphasizing autonomic neuroscience. I predict rapprochement of integrative physiology with systems biology. The resolution will avoid teleological purposiveness, transcend pure mechanism, and incorporate adaptiveness in evolution, i.e., "Darwinian medicine."},

abstract = {1. Myocardial ischaemia and infarction activate vagal and sympathetic sensory endings in the ischaemic myocardium, resulting in powerful reflex effects. The vagal afferents are either mechano- or chemosensitive, whereas sympathetic afferents may be mechano-, chemosensitive or both. 2. Activation of vagal afferents results in sympathoinhibitory, cardioinhibitory, vasodepressor responses. Cardiac sympathetic afferents activated during myocardial ischaemia mediate sympathoexcitatory, vasoconstrictor cardioaccelerator responses. 3. The focus of the present review is on the activation of sympathetic afferents by myocardial ischaemia and on the resulting reflex responses that they mediate. 4. These endings are more likely to be activated as the degree of ischaemia progresses from subendocardial towards transmural. They are evenly distributed between the anterior and inferoposterior wall. Although it has been suggested that these endings are activated by bradykinin, recent evidence indicates that they are activated by adenosine released from the ischaemic myocardium. Results from our laboratory indicate that this effect is due to the activation of adenosine A1, but not adenosine A2 receptors. 5. Activation of ventricular vagal and sympathetic afferent fibres during myocardial ischaemia in humans is responsible for the autonomic changes observed and, in the case of the sympathetic afferents, for the sensation of angina pectoris.},

This review will briefly summarize the neural mechanisms of atrial fibrillation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRECENT FINDINGS: Complex interactions exist between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system on the atrial electrophysiologic properties. Direct autonomic recordings in canine models demonstrated simultaneous sympathovagal discharges are the most common triggers of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Also, intrinsic cardiac autonomic nerve can serve as a sole triggering factor for the initiation of atrial fibrillation. Modulation of autonomic nervous system (ANS) by electrical stimulation has been tried as a treatment strategy clinically and experimentally. Recent studies showed that autonomic nervous system modulation can suppress the stellate ganglion nerve activity and reduce the incidence of paroxysmal atrial tachyarrhythmias in ambulatory dogs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY: The autonomic nerve system influences the initiation and perpetuation of atrial fibrillation. Scientific advances toward a better understanding of the complex interrelationships of the various components of the ANS will hopefully lead to improvement of treatments for this common arrhythmia.},

abstract = {Background: The ganglionated plexi (GP) located at the junction of the superior vena cava, aorta, and right pulmonary artery (SVC-Ao GP) was proposed to be the head station between the extrinsic and the intrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous system (ECANS and ICANS, respectively). Objective: To investigate the chronic effects after interrupting the ECANS-ICANS connections by ablating the SVC-Ao GP. Methods: A right thoracotomy in 10 dogs allowed stimulation at the right superior and inferior pulmonary veins (RSPV and RIPV, respectively), right atrial appendage (RAA), and SVC to determine effective refractory period (ERP) and atrial fibrillation (AF) inducibility in the first operation. Group 1 (n = 5) received SVC-Ao GP ablation; group 2 (n = 5) received no ablation. A second operation and the same measurements were made 10 weeks later. A pacemaker with lead implanted at the RSPV recorded atrial fibrillation or tachycardia (AF/AT). Results: During the first operation in group 1, ERPs increased significantly in the SVC but not at the RSPV, RIPV, or RAA site immediately after ablation, whereas ERPs decreased significantly in the RSPV, RIPV, and RAA but not the SVC in the second operation performed 10 weeks later (compared to the ERP in the first operation). ERPs decreased and AF/AT burden increased significantly from weeks 4 and 5, respectively, after the first operation in group 1 dogs. The ERP and AF/AT burden in group 2 remained unchanged between operations. Conclusions: Ablation of the head station GP between the ECANS and the ICANS prolonged the ERP acutely, but shortened regional ERPs and increased AF/AT burden chronically, suggesting that the ECANS may tonically inhibit the ICANS activity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Heart Rhythm Society.},

abstract = {The immunological problems of pig hearts supporting life in human recipients have potentially been solved by transgenic technology. Nevertheless, other problems still remain. Autonomic innervation is important for the control of cardiac dynamics and there is evidence suggesting that some neurons remain intact after transplantation. Previous studies in the human heart have established regional differences in both general autonomic innervation and in its component neural subpopulations. Such studies are lacking in the pig heart. Quantitative immunohistochemical and histochemical techniques were used to demonstrate the pattern of innervation in pig hearts (Sus scrofa). Gradients of immunoreactivity for the general neural marker protein gene product 9.5 were observed both within and between the endocardial, myocardial and epicardial plexuses throughout the 4 cardiac chambers. An extensive ganglionated plexus was observed in the epicardial tissues and, to a lesser extent, in the myocardial tissues. The predominant neural subpopulation displayed acetylcholinesterase activity, throughout the endocardium, myocardium and epicardium. These nerves showed a right to left gradient in density in the endocardial plexus, which was not observed in either the myocardial or epicardial plexuses. A large proportion of nerves in the ganglionated plexus of the atrial epicardial tissues displayed AChE activity, together with their cell bodies. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive nerves were the next most prominent subpopulation throughout the heart. TH-immunoreactive cell bodies were observed in the atrial ganglionated plexuses. Endocardial TH- and NPY-immunoreactive nerves also displayed a right to left gradient in density, whereas in the epicardial tissues they showed a ventricular to atrial gradient. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-immunoreactive nerves were the most abundant peptide-containing subpopulation after those possessing NPY immunoreactivity. They were most abundant in the epicardial tissues of the ventricles. Several important differences were observed between the innervation of the pig heart compared with the human heart. These differences may have implications for the function of donor transgenic pig hearts within human recipients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the present paper, we describe a model of neurovisceral integration in which a set of neural structures involved in cognitive, affective, and autonomic regulation are related to heart rate variability (HRV) and cognitive performance. METHODS: We detail the pathways involved in the neural regulation of the cardiovascular system and provide pharmacological and neuroimaging data in support of the neural structures linking the central nervous system to HRV in humans. We review a number of studies from our group showing that individual differences in HRV are related to performance on tasks associated with executive function and prefrontal cortical activity. These studies include comparisons of executive- and nonexecutive-function tasks in healthy participants, in both threatening and nonthreatening conditions. In addition, we show that manipulating resting HRV levels is associated with changes in performance on executive-function tasks. We also examine the relationship between HRV and cognitive performance in ecologically valid situations using a police shooting simulation and a naval navigation simulation. Finally, we review our studies in anxiety patients, as well as studies examining psychopathy. CONCLUSION: These findings in total suggest an important relationship among cognitive performance, HRV, and prefrontal neural function that has important implications for both physical and mental health. Future studies are needed to determine exactly which executive functions are associated with individual differences in HRV in a wider range of situations and populations.},

abstract = {Background: The sympathetic nervous system is thought to play a role in the genesis of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT). Left and added right cardiac sympathectomy have been shown to reduce the burden of arrhythmias in the setting of a VT storm. However, the contribution of the right stellate ganglion (RSG) and the left stellate ganglion (LSG) to the innervation of the anterior left ventricular (LV) wall is not well understood. Objective: To evaluate the innervation of the anterior LV wall by the LSG and the RSG. Methods: The heart and stellate ganglia were exposed via sternotomy in pigs with normal hearts (n = 8). A 20-electrode catheter was placed on the anterior LV wall to record activation recovery interval (ARI), a surrogate measure of action potential duration. A microdialysis catheter was inserted in a similar location to sample interstitial norepinephrine (NE) content. ARI and NE measurements were recorded at baseline and during LSG and RSG stimulation. Results: LSG stimulation shortened ARI by 17.1{\%} ± 10.5{\%} (mean ± standard error), while RSG stimulation shortened ARI by 42.1{\%} ± 15.7{\%}, P =.04 (LSG vs RSG). LSG stimulation increased interstitial NE levels by 200{\%} ± 65{\%}, while RSG stimulation increased the NE content by 260{\%} ± 40{\%} (P =.012). LSG stimulation increased dispersion in ARI from 376.0 ± 83.7 ms2 to 1242.5 ± 566 ms2 (P =.03) and caused ventricular fibrillation in 2 pigs. During RSG stimulation, dispersion increased from 419 ± 65.8 to 474.8 ± 81 ms2 (P =.4). Conclusions: Both the LSG and the RSG provide significant innervation to the anterior LV wall as demonstrated by both ARI shortening and NE concentrations. LSG stimulation significantly increases ARI dispersion. This study provides mechanistic insight into the beneficial effects of left sympathectomy and the additional role of right sympathectomy in reducing arrhythmias in patients with anterior myocardial scars and VT storm. {\textcopyright} 2012 Heart Rhythm Society.

Bernard introduced the idea of the internal environment bathing cells - the milieu int{\'{e}}rieur - maintained by continual compensatory changes of bodily functions. Cannon coined the word, "homeostasis," referring to a set of acceptable ranges of values for internal variables. Cannon taught that threats to homeostasis evoke activation of the sympathoadrenal system as a functional unit. Selye defined stress as a state characterized by a uniform response pattern, regardless of the particular stressor, that could lead to long-term pathologic changes. " Allostasis" was introduced as a concept in recognition that there is no single ideal set of steady-state conditions in life; instead, setpoints and other response criteria change continuously. Stress is now viewed neither as a perturbation nor a stereotyped response pattern but as a condition characterized by a perceived discrepancy between information about a monitored variable and criteria for eliciting patterned effector responses. Different stressors elicit different patterns of activation of the sympathetic nervous, adrenomedullary hormonal, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical and other effectors, closing negative feedback loops. This systems concept of stress yields predictions that observation or experimentation can test and that are applicable to normal physiology and to a variety of acute and chronic disorders. {\textcopyright} 2007 Informa UK Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Downregulation of myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor density does not occur in a spatially uniform distribution in patients with congestive heart failure. Rather, it results primarily from loss of receptors in the subendocardium. In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, beta 1-receptors have been found to be downregulated selectively. These observations suggest that considerable transmural heterogeneity in the distribution of beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes exists in the failing human heart. The present study was designed to test this hypothesis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We used quantitative autoradiography of radioligand binding sites to measure the distribution of beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes in transmural sections of left ventricular myocardium obtained from cardiac transplant patients with ischemic (n = 13) and idiopathic dilated (n = 12) cardiomyopathy and from 4 subjects with no history of cognitive heart failure. Analysis of radioligand binding isotherms revealed a significant reduction in total beta-adrenergic receptor density in hearts of patients with ischemic and idiopathic cardiomyopathy (20.3 +/- 1.9 and 18.2 +/- 2.0 fmol/mg protein, respectively, versus 40.0 +/- 11.4 in control subjects; P {\textless} .01 for both). Loss of the beta 1-subtype accounted for 86{\%} of the total reduction in beta-receptor density in failing hearts. Despite the significant decreases in overall tissue receptor content, the densities of total beta-receptors and beta-receptor subtypes in subepicardial myocytes were equivalent in failing and control hearts. However, in contrast to control hearts, in which the transmural distribution of total and beta 1-receptors was uniform (endocardial: epicardial receptor density ratios, 0.97 +/- 0.14 and 1.0 +/- 0.2, respectively), hearts of patients with ischemic and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy had significantly lower total beta-receptor and beta 1-receptor densities in the subendocardium (ratios, 0.66 +/- 0.06 and 0.46 +/- 0.09 for total and beta 1-receptors, respectively, in ischemic cardiomyopathy and 0.60 +/- 0.08 and 0.52 +/- 0.11 in dilated cardiomyopathy; P {\textless} .001 for all values compared with a ratio of 1). Thus, beta 1: beta 2 receptor density ratios were markedly decreased in the subendocardium of ischemic and idiopathic dilated left ventricles compared with control hearts.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: A significant transmural gradient in the density of myocardial beta 1-adrenergic receptors exists in the hearts of patients with ischemic and dilated cardiomyopathy, resulting in a markedly altered beta 1: beta 2 receptor density ratio in the subendocardium.},

abstract = {Many therapeutic interventions in disease states of heightened cardiac sympathetic activity are targeted to the myocytes. However, emerging clinical data highlights a dominant role in disease progression by the neurons themselves. Here we describe a novel experimental model of the peripheral neuro-cardiac axis to study the neuron's ability to drive a myocyte cAMP phenotype. We employed a co-culture of neonatal ventricular myocytes and sympathetic stellate neurons from normal (WKY) and pro-hypertensive (SHR) rats that are sympathetically hyper-responsive and measured nicotine evoked cAMP responses in the myocytes using a fourth generation FRET cAMP sensor. We demonstrated the dominant role of neurons in driving the myocyte {\ss}-adrenergic phenotype, where SHR cultures elicited heightened myocyte cAMP responses during neural activation. Moreover, cross-culturing healthy neurons onto diseased myocytes rescued the diseased cAMP response of the myocyte. Conversely, healthy myocytes developed a diseased cAMP response if diseased neurons were introduced. Our results provide evidence for a dominant role played by the neuron in driving the adrenergic phenotype seen in cardiovascular disease. We also highlight the potential of using healthy neurons to turn down the gain of neurotransmission, akin to a smart pre-synaptic {\ss}-blocker.},

We hypothesized that nicotinic stimulation of individual GPs exerts divergent regional influences, affecting atrial as well as ventricular functions. In 22 anesthetized canines, unipolar electrograms were recorded from 127 atrial and 127 ventricular epicardial loci during nicotine injection (100 mcg in 0.1 ml) into either the 1) right atrial (RA), 2) dorsal atrial, 3) left atrial, 4) inferior vena cava-inferior left atrial, 5) right ventricular, 6) ventral septal ventricular or 7) cranial medial ventricular (CMV) GP. In addition to sinus and AV nodal function, neural effects on atrial and ventricular repolarization were identified as changes in the area subtended by unipolar recordings under basal conditions and at maximum neurally-induced effects. Animals were studied with intact AV node or following ablation to achieve ventricular rate control. Atrial rate was affected in response to stimulation of all 7 GPs with an incidence of 50-95{\%} of the animals among the different GPs. AV conduction was affected following stimulation of 6/7 GP with an incidence of 22-75{\%} among GPs. Atrial and ventricular repolarization properties were affected by atrial as well as ventricular GP stimulation. Distinct regional patterns of repolarization changes were identified in response to stimulation of individual GPs. RAGP predominantly affected the RA and posterior right ventricular walls whereas CMVGP elicited biatrial and biventricular repolarization changes. Spatially divergent and overlapping cardiac regions are affected in response to nicotinic stimulation of neurons in individual GPs. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Intracardiac pathways mediating the parasympathetic control of various cardiac functions are incompletely understood. Several intracardiac ganglia have been demonstrated to potently influence cardiac rate [the sinoatrial (SA) ganglion], atrioventricular (AV) conduction (the AV ganglion), or left ventricular contractility (the cranioventricular ganglion). However, there are numerous ganglia found throughout the heart whose functions are poorly characterized. One such ganglion, the posterior atrial (PA) ganglion, is found in a fat pad on the rostral dorsal surface of the right atrium. We have investigated the potential impact of this ganglion on cardiac rate and AV conduction. We report that microinjections of a ganglionic blocker into the PA ganglion significantly attenuates the negative chronotropic effects of vagal stimulation without significantly influencing negative dromotropic effects. Because prior evidence indicates that the PA ganglion does not project to the SA node, we neuroanatomically tested the hypothesis that the PA ganglion mediates its effect on cardiac rate through an interganglionic projection to the SA ganglion. Subsequent to micro-injections of the retrograde tracer fast blue into the SA ganglion, {\textgreater}70{\%} of the retrogradely labeled neurons found within five intracardiac ganglia throughout the heart were observed in the PA ganglion. The neuroanatomic data further indicate that intraganglionic neuronal circuits are found within the SA ganglion. The present data support the hypothesis that two interacting cardiac centers, i.e., the SA and PA ganglia, mediate the peripheral parasympathetic control of cardiac rate. These data further support the emerging concept of an intrinsic cardiac nervous system.},

abstract = {The close dependence of vascular tone on sympathetic impulses as shown by more or less persistent vasodilatation when the sympathetic nerves to arterioles are cut, the importance of vascular tone for the proper distribution of blood in the body, and the recent increase in the application of surgery to the sympathetic system render important an enquiry into the effect of sympathectomy on blood pressure. The work of W. B. Cannon, Lewis and Britton (1927) proved that animals can survive total abolition of sympathetic activity in the body. It was clear, therefore, that a study could be made of the effects on blood pressure of extirpating not only parts of the sympathetic system but the whole system as a distributor of tonic impulses to blood vessels. METHOD. For the present study dogs between 11 kgm. and 13 kgm. in weight were used. They were found large enough to allow accurate readings of the blood pressure and small enough to make operating possible. They were trained to lie quietly on a table during the blood-pressure de-terminations. A typical rubber cuff, reduced in width to about 8 cm., was used, and the pressure was measured by means of a mercury manometer. The cuff was applied to the leg below the knee; a small diaphragm stethoscope , or palpation, or both, were used to determine the disappearance and reappearance of the pulse. The artery (dorsalis pedis) on the anterior surface of the foot served for the observations. By this method it was possible to get reasonably consistent results in repeated observations within a brief period under similar conditions. Care was taken to place the cuff as nearly as possible in the same position in successive readings. The heart rate was recorded with the blood pressure. With one exception the parts of the sympathetic system were removed in the same order. The first step was the removal of both abdominal chains from the diaphragm to the sacrum and the severance of the right splanch-nits at the diaphragm. The second was the removal of the right thoracic chain from the stellate ganglion to the diaphragm through which were pulled the remnants of the splanchnics. The final operation involved the removal of the left thoracic chain from the stellate ganglion to the dia-592},

Some pharmacological data, however, are inconsistent with these conclusions. We have examined the cardiodynamic effects of discrete injections of a ganglionic blocking drug into two fat pads on the surface of the cat heart. These fat pads were shown to contain ganglion cells histologically. It was observed that vagal effects upon cardiac rate are selectively mediated by neurons located in ganglia overlying the right pulmonary veins at the junction of the right atrium and superior vena cava. On the other hand, vagal effects upon AV conduction were selectively mediated by neurons located in a fat pad at the junction of the inferior vena cava and the inferior left atrium. These pharmacological data support the concept that specific intracardiac ganglia are capable of selective control of SA rate and AV conduction. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

The selective alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists used were St 587 and BHT 933 respectively, and the antagonists were prazosin (alpha 1) and WY 25309 (alpha 2). The selective beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists were atenolol and ICI 118551, respectively. Pirbuterol was a highly selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist. The non-selective agonists noradrenaline, adrenaline and isoprenaline were also employed with various combinations of antagonists. Phenylephrine was found to stimulate beta- as well as alpha-adrenoceptors. Rimiterol was a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, partially selective for beta 2-adrenoceptors. In the sinus node beta 1-, but not beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation increased the fast phase of depolarization (Vmax). Both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation increased the slope of slow diastolic depolarization, accelerated repolarization and increased maximum diastolic potential. After blockade of both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation caused bradycardia, due exclusively to delayed repolarization. alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulation had no effect. In Purkinje cells and papillary muscle both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation accelerated repolarization. Stimulation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors had no effect. Beta 1-, not beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation augmented peak contractions 3-5-fold, and greatly increased rate of development of tension. After beta-blockade alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation moderately increased peak contractions (up to 47{\%}), but increased time-to-peak and duration of contractions. These patterns of adrenoceptor-mediated effects were unchanged in animals pre-treated with sufficient 6-hydroxydopamine to eliminate responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation. The results would be consistent with beta 1-, and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation increasing inward calcium current, and with stimulation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors delaying its inactivation, rather than increasing its magnitude.},

abstract = {Brain stimulation can provoke a variety of arrhythmias and lower the ventricular vulnerable threshold. In the animal with acute myocardial ischemia such stimuli suffice to provoke ventricular fibrillation. Vagal neural traffic or adrenal catecholamines are not the conduits for this brain-heart linkage. Accompanying increases in heart rate or blood pressure are not prerequisites for the changes in cardiac excitability. Increased sympathetic activity, whether induced by neural or neurohumoral action, predisposes the heart to ventricular fibrillation. Protection can be achieved with surgical and pharmacologic denervation or reflex reduction in sympathetic tone. With acute myocardial ischemia, augmented sympathetic activity accounts for the early surge of ectopic activity frequently precipitating ventricular fibrillation. Asymmetries in sympathetic neural discharge may also contribute to the genesis of serious arrhythmias. The vagus nerve, through its muscarinic action, exerts an indirect effect on cardiac vulnerability, the consequence of annulment of concomitant adrenergic influence, rather than of any direct cholinergic action on the ventricles. There exist anatomic, physiologic as well as molecular bases for such interactions. Available experimental evidence indicates that environmental stresses of diverse types can injure the heart, lower the threshold of cardiac vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation and, in the animal with coronary occlusion, provoke potentially malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Available evidence indicates that in man, as in the experimental animal, administration of catecholamines can induce ventricular arrhythmia, whereas vagal activity exerts an opposite effect. Furthermore, in certain subjects diverse stresses and various psychologic states provoke ventricular ectopic activity. {\textcopyright} 1977 Dun {\textperiodcentered} Donnelley Publishing Corporation 666 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10019 All rights reserved.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine the capacity of nodose ganglion afferent neurones with epicardial sensory endings to respond to mechanical and chemical stimuli, in particular to purinergic compounds.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Alterations in spontaneous activity generated by epicardial afferent neurones in nodose ganglia in situ of 17 anaesthetised dogs were identified using extracellular recording techniques when mechanical and chemical stimuli were applied to their receptor fields, as well as during brief periods of coronary artery occlusion.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: 92 cardiac afferent neurones were identified. Localised epicardial distortion modified the activity generated by 34 neurones [0.19(SEM 0.02) to 1.2(0.4) impulses.s-1]. Application of bradykinin, substance P, N6-cyclopentyladenosine or beta, gamma-methylene adenosine 5'-triphosphate to localised epicardial fields altered the activity of 69 neurones. Thus the majority of identified epicardial neurones responded to chemical stimuli alone (63{\%}) as opposed to mechanical stimuli alone (25{\%}), 12{\%} responding to both types of stimuli. Activity was enhanced overall by chemical stimuli from a mean range of 0.1-0.4 to 11.6-13.2 impulses.s-1. Following termination of short lasting chemical as opposed to mechanical stimuli, activity remained increased for up to 45 min. Activity generated by 16 chemosensitive neurones was modified by brief periods of coronary artery occlusion [0.26(0.12)-1.66(0.61) impulses.s-1]; activity increasing further [2.51(0.47) impulses.s-1] during reperfusion periods.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: (1) Chemical stimuli induce an order magnitude greater enhancement of activity generated by nodose ganglion cardiac afferent neurones than do mechanical stimuli, such enhancement persisting long after removal of chemical as opposed to mechanical stimuli. Thus qualitative and quantitative differences exists between central neuronal inputs derived from nodose ganglion epicardial afferent neurones sensitive to chemical as opposed to mechanical stimuli.

H., Schaefer, V., Gaab, J., {\ldots} Bader, K. (2015). Blunted endocrine and cardiovascular reactivity in young healthy women reporting a history of childhood adversity. Psychoneuroendocrinology, 51, 58-67. doi: 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.09.008 ], the present analysis aimed at clarifying the role of the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system in this relationship. DESIGN AND METHODS One hundred eighteen healthy young women provided data on ACEs and underwent psychosocial stress testing. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA, quantified by high-frequency HR variability) were assessed as measures of sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiovascular activity, respectively. A mediation model was calculated to test the indirect effects of ACEs on HR via SBP and RSA. RESULTS The effect of ACEs on HR reactivity was mediated by SBP reactivity but not by RSA reactivity. ACEs were associated with reduced SBP at rest. CONCLUSIONS ACEs were associated with down-regulation in a measure of sympathetic but no alteration in a measure of parasympathetic cardiovascular stress reactivity in adulthood. Future research will need to clarify whether this indicates risk or resilience.},

abstract = {There are complex interactions between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system inputs to the sinus node. The concept of “sympathovagal balance” reflects the autonomic state resulting from the sympathetic and parasympathetic influences. Despite widespread usage of a variety of heart rate (HR) variability parameters as indexes of sympathovagal balance, no index has been validated as a measure of sympathovagal balance. This study evaluated the utility of HR, HR variability, and a new parameter termed the vagal-sympathetic effect (VSE) as indexes of sympathovagal balance. The ideal parameter had to satisfy the following criteria: 1) the index should vary similarly among subjects in response to different autonomic conditions; 2) the variability in the index among subjects exposed to the same autonomic conditions should be small; and 3) the response of the index to various autonomic conditions should reflect the underlying changes in physiological state and have a meaningful interpretation. Volunteers [8 men, 6 women; mean age 28.5 ± 4.8 (SD) yr] were evaluated for the effects of sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation and blockade on HR and HR variability. VSE was defined as the ratio of the R-R interval to the intrinsic R-R interval. VSE and R-R interval consistently changed in the expected directions with parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation and blockade. A general linearized model was used to evaluate the response of each parameter. VSE and R-R interval had r 2 values of 0.847 and 0.852, respectively. Natural logarithm of the low-frequency power had an r 2 value of 0.781 with lower r 2 values for all the other HR variability parameters. The coefficient of variation was also lowest for each condition tested for the VSE and the R-R interval. VSE and R-R interval best satisfy the criteria for the ideal index of sympathovagal balance. Because it is impractical under most conditions to measure the VSE as the index of sympathovagal balance, the most suitable index is the R-R interval.},

To delineate the distribution of beta-receptor subtypes in myocytic and vascular components of the heart, we incubated transmural sections of canine left ventricle with [125Iodo]cyanopindolol and selected concentrations of the beta 1-selective antagonist betaxolol or the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551. Detailed competition binding data were best accounted for by a two-site model in which approximately 75{\%} of total sites were beta 1- and 25{\%} were beta 2-receptors. The relative proportions of beta-receptor subtypes in myocytic and vascular components were assessed autoradiographically by analyzing the density of binding sites in transmural sections incubated with radioligand and subtype-selective displacers. Betaxolol (10(-7) M) reduced the density of radioligand binding sites by 44{\%} in regions composed primarily of ventricular myocytes but by less than 5{\%} in small coronary arterioles. ICI 118,551 (10(-7) M) reduced radioligand binding-site density by 18{\%} in myocytic regions and by 55{\%} in small arterioles. In myocytic regions, these data indicated a subtype composition of approximately 85{\%} beta 1- and 15{\%} beta 2-sites. In contrast, arterioles contained almost exclusively the beta 2-subtype. The diameters of coronary vessels in which beta 2-receptors were found to be selectively increased fell within a narrow range (mean +/- SD, 35 +/- 11 microns; range, 16-55 microns). Small mural arteries and venules did not contain a significantly higher proportion of beta 2-receptors than adjacent myocytic regions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Stimulation of left ventricular (LV) receptors with sympathetic afferents generally results in reflex sympathoexcitatory responses. Stimulation of LV receptors with vagal afferents results in reflex sympathoinhibitory responses. Vagal afferents are known to be preferentially distributed to the inferoposterior (IP) wall of the LV. We tested the hypothesis that there is also a preferential distribution of LV sympathetic afferents. METHODS AND RESULTS We measured reflex responses to stimulation of sympathetic afferents located in the anterior and IP LV: We used myocardial ischemia and chemical stimuli to increase the activity of the sensory endings in 15 chloralose-anesthetized, mechanically ventilated dogs with sinoaortic denervation and vagotomy. Reflex responses were assessed by direct recordings of efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA). In nine dogs, maximal RSNA changes elicited by transmural anterior myocardial ischemia (22.6 +/- 3.9{\%} increase from baseline nerve traffic) were not significantly different from maximal RSNA changes observed during transmural IP ischemia (27.1 +/- 4.4{\%}). Similar changes in mean arterial and left atrial pressures were noted during transmural anterior and IP ischemia. In eight dogs, maximal changes of RSNA elicited by epicardial or intracoronary bradykinin to the anterior LV were not significantly different from those observed during bradykinin to the IP LV (anterior epicardial bradykinin, 76.7 +/- 11.7{\%}; IP epicardial bradykinin, 72.2 +/- 10.0{\%}; anterior intracoronary bradykinin, 84.6 +/- 21.0{\%}; IP intracoronary bradykinin, 88.8 +/- 17.3{\%}).

abstract = {Objective: To define the clinical features and biomarkers that predict which patients with pure autonomic failure will develop Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy. Methods: One hundred patients who presented with pure autonomic failure were recruited at 5 medical centers in the United States. Seventy-four patients agreed to be followed prospectively. Patients underwent clinical evaluations including neurological rating scales, sleep questionnaires, smell test, and sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiovascular autonomic function tests. Results: At enrollment, patients were 68 ± 12 years old (median ± interquartile range) and had had autonomic failure for 5 ± 7 years. Within 4 years of follow-up, 25 of 74 subjects (34{\%}) developed dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 13), Parkinson disease (n = 6), or multiple system atrophy (n = 6). The presence of probable rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder was strongly associated with the development of a manifest central nervous system (CNS) synucleinopathy (odds ratio = 7.1). Patients who phenoconverted to multiple system atrophy had younger age at onset of autonomic failure, severe bladder/bowel dysfunction, preserved olfaction, and a cardiac chronotropic response upon tilt {\textgreater} 10 beats per minute. Those who phenoconverted to Parkinson disease or dementia with Lewy bodies had decreased olfaction, a lesser chronotropic response to tilt, and a longer duration of illness. The small group of patients retaining the pure autonomic failure phenotype had very low plasma norepinephrine levels, slow resting heart rate, no REM sleep behavior disorder, and preserved smell. Interpretation: Patients presenting with pure autonomic failure are at high risk of phenoconverting to a manifest CNS synucleinopathy. Specific clinical features predict future diagnosis.

These denervated regions subsequently show supersensitive shortening of effective refractory period (ERP) in response to the infusion of norepinephrine (denervation supersensitivity). The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that such denervation supersensitivity is arrhythmogenic. Ventricular arrhythmias were elicited by programmed ventricular stimulation (PVS) during a control period, during bilateral stimulation of the ansae subclaviae (4 msec pulses, 4 Hz and 3 mA), and during the infusion of norepinephrine (0.5 $\mu$g/kg/min). Study groups consisted of 14 sham-operated dogs, 16 dogs with phenol painted over a diagonal branch, 13 dogs with latex embolization of a diagonal branch that resulted in transmural myocardial infarction, 14 dogs with a one-stage ligation of a diagonal branch producing nontransmural myocardial infarction, and 12 dogs undergoing both phenol painting and one-stage ligation of a diagonal branch. Four to 22 days after the first operation, PVS was performed in anesthetized, open-chest dogs after neural decentralization of the heart. Dogs with phenol painting on the epicardium and dogs in which latex was injected into a diagonal branch showed supersensitive shortening of ERP to infused norepinephrine at apical sites. PVS resulted in ventricular fibrillation more often during stimulation of the ansae subclaviae (p {\textless} .001) and infusion of norepinephrine (p {\textless} .001) than during the control state in dogs treated with phenol alone. The incidence of ventricular fibrillation was highest in dogs with ligation-induced infarction that received phenol compared with all other groups during control (p {\textless} .001), stimulation of the ansae subclaviae (p {\textless} .002), and the infusion of norepinephrine (p {\textless} .01). Propranolol (0.5 mg/kg or 10 mg iv at maximum) attenuated supersensitive shortening of ERP and decreased the incidence of induction of ventricular fibrillation. We conclude that (1) the canine heart with phenol-induced sympathetic supersensitivity, but without myocardial infarction, is more vulnerable to PVS-induced ventricular fibrillation during the infusion of norepinephrine compared with the control group, (2) the canine heart with latex-induced myocardial infarction shows sympathetic supersensitivity, but is not more vulnerable to PVS-induced ventricular fibrillation during stimulation of the ansae subclaviae and infusion of norepinephrine, (3) phenol-induced sympathetic supersensitivity combined with nontransmural myocardial infarction makes the canine heart more vulnerable to PVS-induced ventricular fibrillation than any of the other study conditions.},

This selective review provides an update about cardiovascular therapeutic implications of neurocardiology, with emphasis on disorders involving primary or secondary abnormalities of catecholamine systems. Concepts of scientific integrative medicine help understand these disorders. Scientific integrative medicine is not a treatment method or discipline but a way of thinking that applies systems concepts to acute and chronic disorders of regulation. Some of these concepts include stability by negative feedback regulation, multiple effectors, effector sharing, instability by positive feedback loops, allostasis, and allostatic load. Scientific integrative medicine builds on systems biology but is also distinct in several ways. A large variety of drugs and non-drug treatments are now available or under study for neurocardiologic disorders in which catecholamine systems are hyperfunctional or hypofunctional.

@article{Minisi1991,
abstract = {91284342 Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia/Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond BACKGROUND. Left ventricular sympathetic afferent nerves are located mainly in superficial epicardial layers. Reflex excitatory responses mediated by sympathetic afferent nerves have been observed during myocardial ischemia in cats and humans but not in dogs. Previous canine studies have induced ischemia by occlusion of a coronary artery. Extensive collateral circulation in the canine heart may limit ischemia of epicardial layers during simple coronary occlusion, resulting in little stimulation of sympathetic afferent nerves and minimal reflex excitatory responses. METHODS AND RESULTS. In anesthetized dogs with sinoaortic and vagal deafferentation, we determined whether reflex sympathoexcitatory responses mediated by sympathetic afferents occurred during transmural myocardial ischemia. Reflex sympathoexcitation was quantitated by direct recording from either efferent renal (n = 20) or cardiac (n = 5) sympathetic nerves. Responses of arterial pressure and efferent sympathetic nerve activity were measured during simple occlusion of the anterior descending artery (LAD alone) and during LAD occlusion with a circumflex stenosis (LAD + CIRC). This circumflex stenosis was adjusted to abolish coronary vasodilator reserve without reducing basal flow. We observed significantly greater reflex increases in renal (32 +/- 5{\%}) and cardiac (58 +/- 15{\%}) nerve activity during LAD + CIRC than during LAD alone (14 +/- 6{\%} and 8 +/- 7{\%}, respectively). Reflex changes in renal nerve activity during LAD + CIRC were abolished by interruption of cardiac sympathetic afferent pathways (n = 5). In eight experiments, myocardial blood flow was measured during the two coronary occlusions. These experiments confirmed that LAD + CIRC elicited more transmural ischemia in the LAD distribution than did LAD alone. However, these experiments also revealed that LAD + CIRC elicited endocardial ischemia in the circumflex distribution. In five additional experiments, regional sympathetic deafferentation of the posterior left ventricle by epicardial application of 88{\%} phenol along the atrioventricular groove had no significant effect on renal nerve responses to LAD + CIRC (36 +/- 5{\%} increase before phenol versus 31 +/- 3{\%} increase after phenol). These results indicate that endocardial ischemia in the circumflex distribution did not contribute to the reflex increases in nerve activity that were noted during LAD + CIRC. CONCLUSIONS. Reflex sympathoexcitation mediated by cardiac sympathetic afferents can be elicited in dogs. However, these responses are significant only during ischemia that is transmural and involves the superficial epicardial layers of the left ventricle},

@article{Herring2015,
abstract = {NEW FINDINGS: What is the topic of this review? This symposium report discusses the evidence for release of cardiac sympathetic cotransmitters in addition to noradrenaline. What advances does it highlight? It highlights the potential role of neuropeptide Y in reducing vagal neurotransmission and directly influencing ventricular myocyte excitability in the presence of $\beta$-receptor blockade. Acute myocardial infarction and congestive cardiac failure are characterized by high levels of cardiac sympathetic drive. In these conditions, sympathetic neurotransmitters such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) can be released in addition to noradrenaline, and plasma levels correlate with infarct size and mortality. Even in the presence of $\beta$-blockers, NPY is able to bind to its own receptors located on cholinergic ganglia and ventricular myocytes. In this symposium report, I review the evidence that NPY can inhibit acetylcholine release during vagus nerve stimulation and limit the subsequent bradycardia. I also present preliminary, as yet unpublished data, demonstrating that NPY may be pro-arrhythmic by directly influencing ventricular electrophysiology. Targeting NPY receptors pharmacologically may therefore be a useful therapeutic strategy both to reduce heart rate and to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of myocardial infarction and chronic heart failure. Such medications would be expected to act synergistically with $\beta$-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and implantable cardiac devices, such as defibrillators and vagus nerve stimulators.},

abstract = {Ventricular arrhythmias generally result in a decrease in arterial pressure and increases in atrial and ventricular filling pressures which would be expected to induce reflex changes in efferent sympathetic nerve activity to the heart and peripheral circulation. Experiments were performed in 14 anesthetized dogs in order to 1) determine whether programmed ventricular stimulation produces changes in renal sympathetic nerve activity; 2) quantitate these changes; and 3) determine the cardiovascular reflexes that mediate these changes. Arterial and right atrial pressures and renal sympathetic nerve activity were recorded in dogs before and after administration of single and double programmed ventricular stimuli. In a group of 10 dogs after single extrastimuli, diastolic arterial pressure decreased by 18 ± 2 mm Hg (mean ± SEM) while renal sympathetic nerve activity increased by 39 ± 15 impulses/s. These changes were directly related to degree of stimulus prematurity. After double extrastimuli, diastolic arterial pressure decreased by 22 ± 2 mm Hg whereas renal sympathetic activity increased by 55 ± 8 impulses/s. In an additional four dogs, double extrastimuli decreased arterial pressure (−34 ± 1 mm Hg) and increased cardiac (86 ± 16{\%}) and renal (82 ± 12{\%}) sympathetic traffic. After si-noaortic denervation, neither single nor double programmed ventricular stimuli resulted in alterations in cardiac or renal sympathetic nerve activity. It is concluded that the decreased arterial pressure caused by single and double programmed ventricular stimuli leads to increases in cardiac and renal sympathetic nerve activity that are mediated by sinoaortic baroreflexes. {\textcopyright} 1987, American College of Cardiology.

In 440 middle-aged men and women, resting HF-HRV was related to regional CBF derived from a resting arterial spin-labeled MRI scan and to seven neuropsychological tests of executive function. Despite some intercorrelations, regression modeling failed to support integrated central control of HF-HRV and executive function. Integration between autonomic and cognitive control appears more circumscribed than the general integration suggested by the neurovisceral integration hypothesis.},

abstract = {The purpose of this article is to review the nerve sprouting hypothesis of sudden cardiac death. It is known that sympathetic stimulation is important in the generation of sudden cardiac death. For example, there is a diurnal variation of sudden death rate in patients with myocardial infarction. Beta blockers, or drugs with beta blocking effects, are known to prevent sudden cardiac death. It was unclear if the cardiac nerves in the heart play only a passive role in the mechanisms of sudden death. To determine if nerve sprouting and neural remodeling occur after myocardial infarction, we performed immunocytochemical studies of cardiac nerves in explanted native hearts of transplant recipients. We found that there was a positive correlation between nerve density and a clinical history of ventricular arrhythmia. Encouraged by these results, we performed a study in dogs to determine whether or not nerve growth factor (NGF) infusion to the left stellate ganglion can facilitate the development of ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), and sudden cardiac death (SCD). The results showed that augmented myocardial sympathetic nerve sprouting through NGF infusion plus atrioventricular (AV) block and MI result in a 44{\%} incidence (four of nine dogs) of SCD and a high incidence of VT in the chronic phase of MI. In contrast, none of the six dogs (with AV block and MI) without NGF infusion died suddenly or had frequent VT episodes. Based on these findings, we propose the nerve sprouting hypothesis of ventricular arrhythmia and SCD. The hypothesis states that MI results in nerve injury, followed by sympathetic nerve sprouting and regional (heterogeneous) myocardial hyperinnervation. The coupling between augmented sympathetic nerve sprouting with electrically remodeled myocardium results in VT, VF and SCD. Modification of nerve sprouting after MI may provide a novel opportunity for arrhythmia control. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {The origins and organization of cardiac sympathetic postganglionic nerves in the rat were identified in the present investigation. The retrograde tracer, Diamidino Yellow, was injected into the right or left ventricles to label somata in the sympathetic chain. Analysis of all sympathetic ganglia from superior cervical ganglion through the 10th thoracic ganglion indicated that the postganglionic innervation of the rat cardiac ventricles originates bilaterally. The majority of these somata were located in the middle and inferior cervical ganglia (middle cervical-stellate ganglion complex) (approximately 92{\%} of all labelled cells), with lesser contributions from the superior cervical and 4th through 6th thoracic ganglia. To confirm and further quantitate these findings, the middle cervical-stellate ganglion complex was removed (MC-S ganglionectomy) bilaterally or ipsilaterally from the left or right sides, and regional cardiac norepinephrine concentration (left and right atrial appendages and left and right ventricles) was analysed 7 or 28 days later. At both times after bilateral MC-S ganglionectomy, regional cardiac norepinephrine was reduced by 89{\%} to 100{\%}, indicating the removal of almost all cardiac noradrenergic cells of origin and possibly fibers of passage. The results of unilateral MC-S ganglionectomy experiments indicated that the atrial appendages and the left ventricle receive bilateral innervation from the middle cervical-stellate ganglion complex. However, the left middle cervical-stellate ganglion complex appears to contribute a majority of the norepinephrine to the right ventricle. Furthermore, between 7 and 28 days after contralateral MC-S ganglionectomy, atrial appendages, but not ventricles, display significant recovery of norepinephrine content. The present data demonstrate: (1) a bilateral locus of origin of cardiac sympathetic postganglionic neurons, limited longitudinally to cervical through mid-thoracic ganglia, and (2) the ability of the cardiac postganglionic innervation to regenerate after partial denervation. These results demonstrate anatomical evidence for significant bilateral integration of cardiac sympathetic activity at the level of the sympathetic ganglion in the rat. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {KEY POINTS Cardiac sympathetic afferents are considered to be essential pathways for transmission of cardiac nociception to the central nervous system during myocardial ischaemia. However, a potential contribution of the CSAR control of cardiac dysfunction in both normal and chronic heart failure (CHF) states remains unknown. We found that activation of the CSAR evokes little increase in cardiac contractility with an exaggerated peripheral vasoconstriction in the CHF state. CSAR inhibition by epicardial lidocaine decreased cardiac contractility to a greater extent in CHF rats than sham rats. Furthermore, we also found that epicardial lidocaine paradoxically decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (preload) in CHF rats, which was not observed in sham rats. Chronic ablation of the CSAR by epicardial application of the afferent neurotoxin, RTX, selectively lowered diastolic blood pressure CHF rats. The observation suggests that CSAR has a differential effect on cardiac function in normal and CHF states. CSAR activation in normal state causes significant increase in cardiac contractility and cardiac output. ABSTRACT The enhanced 'cardiac sympathetic afferent reflex' (CSAR) critically contributes to the exaggerated global sympathetic tone in chronic heart failure (CHF). However, a potential contribution of the cardio-cardiac reflex control of cardiac function in both normal and CHF states remains unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effects of direct activation or inhibition of the CSAR on cardiac function by pressure-volume (P-V) loop analysis in ∼12-week sham-operated and myocardial infarcted (MI) rats. In sham rats, acute CSAR activation by epicardial application of bradykinin (BK) increased heart rate (HR), left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), the maximum first derivative of left ventricular pressure (dp/dtmax ), and the slope of the end-systolic P-V relationship (ESPVR), suggesting that acute CSAR activation in the normal state enhances myocardial contractility. CSAR activation also decreased left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic volumes with little effect on LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) or the end-diastolic P-V relationship (EDPVR) in sham rats. Compared to sham, CHF rats exhibit a reduced increase in the slope of the ESPVR and dp/dtmax in response to BK, indicating a poor contractile response to CSAR activation. Interestingly, BK application in CHF rats increased cardiac systolic and diastolic volumes and further increased the elevated LVEDP, neither of which was seen in sham rats. Following CSAR inhibition by epicardial lidocaine, blood pressure, HR, LVSP, dp/dt, LVEDP and ESPVR decreased in CHF rats whereas lidocaine had little effect in sham rats, indicating that the CSAR is tonically active in CHF and contributes to cardiac dysfunction. Furthermore, we found that epicardial lidocaine paradoxically decreased LV end-diastolic volume (preload) in CHF rats, which was not observed in sham rats. The decreased preload by lidocaine in CHF rats may be due to a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance since epicardial lidocaine significantly lowered peripheral (renal) sympathetic nerve activity in CHF rats but not in sham rats. Furthermore, chronic ablation of CSAR by epicardial application of a selective afferent neurotoxin, resiniferatoxin, selectively lowered diastolic blood pressure both at daytime and night-time with less effect on systolic blood pressure in CHF rats. Our data suggest that there is an imbalance between cardiac and peripheral responses to CSAR in CHF animals compared to sham-operated controls.},

No victims of sudden violent deaths showed these cardiac lesions. Focal myocardial damage required at least 6 hours to develop after onset of the acute neurological event and was not observed after the second week. It was associated with lesions producing a rapid increase in intracranial pressure and was usually absent in patients with slowly enlarging or small cerebral lesions. Similar myocardial changes were seen in patients in the control group dying from prolonged shock or other forms of acute circulatory or metabolic failure. The postulated mechanisms of cardiac damage in these patients is increased levels of plasma catecholamines secondary to rapidly increasing intracranial pressure, irrespective of the cerebral pathology.},

abstract = {The effects of thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) on the circulation at rest, during, and after physical exercise were investigated in 10 volunteers. At rest, TEA did not affect oxygen consumption (Vo2) or cardiac output (Q), but heart rate (HR) was, increased by 7 beats/min, and stroke volume decreased correspondingly by 13 ml. Systolic arterial blood pressure was slightly reduced, but no other changes in systemic or pulmonary circulatory parameters were produced. TEA did not change VO2 during exercise, a 2.1 l/min reduction of Q being accompanied by a 4.2{\%} increase of oxygen utilization coefficient. HR showed a relative reduction of about 10{\%}. At moderate work loads during TEA, systemic arterial blood pressures were significantly lower than during control exercise. The resulting rate pressure product (RPP) was markedly reduced, while total peripheral resistance (TPR) remained unchanged. During recovery after the termination of exercise during TEA, VO2, Q, HR, RPP and TPR fell more rapidly towards values obtained at rest. From a clinical point of view the results support the safeness of TEA and also support its use in surgical patients with heart disease. {\textcopyright} 1978 Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Fonden},

abstract = {Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with an adverse and sustained increase in cardiac sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), triggering potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmias. While myocardial reperfusion undoubtedly improves patient prognosis, it remains unknown whether reperfusion therapy also attenuates the dangerous increase in SNA. This study aimed to investigate the effect of time-dependent coronary reperfusion therapy on cardiac SNA following acute MI. Electrophysiological recordings of cardiac efferent SNA were performed in urethane-anaesthetized rats following ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (i.e., MI) for either 15 or 45 min, followed by ‘early' or ‘delayed' reperfusion, respectively. Another group of rats had permanent ischemia with no reperfusion. Forty-five minutes of ischemia induced a 55 {\%} increase in efferent SNA. Subsequent ‘delayed' reperfusion was ineffective at ameliorating further increases in SNA (maximal 153 {\%} increase), so that MI-induced increases in SNA mirrored that observed in rats with permanent MI. Although SNA did not increase during 15 min of ischemia, it did significantly increase, albeit delayed, during the subsequent reperfusion period (max. 75 {\%} increase). Importantly, however, this increase in SNA, which tended to be lower in the ‘early'-reperfusion group, was matched with a lower incidence of arrhythmias and mortality rate, compared to the ‘delayed'-reperfusion and permanent-MI groups. These results highlight that ‘prompt' coronary reperfusion, before SNA becomes activated, may provide a crucial window of opportunity for improving outcome. Further research is essential to identify the mechanisms that underpin, not only sympathetic activation, but also importantly sympathetic deactivation as a potential therapeutic target for MI.},

abstract = {Introduction: Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve has been shown to protect against ven-tricular tachyarrhythmia (VT). The exact mechanism of this effect is unknown and it also remains unclear whether acute or chronic withdrawal of tonic vagal efferent activity to the heart predisposes the heart to VT. To investigate this, we acutely silenced the vagal preganglio-nic neurones in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DVMN) in a rat model using a pharmogenetic approach, and we used the triple-synuclein-null mice as a model of autonomic dysfunction associated with chronic reduction of vagal tone. Methods: In 12 male Sprague-Dawley rats (380-420g), lentiviral vectors were used to transduce DVMN neurones to express an inhibitory Gi-protein-coupled Drosophila allatostatin receptor (AlstR) or green fluorescent protein as a control. Application of a natural ligand of AlstR-an insect peptide allatostatin (5 ml) produces selective and rapid silencing of targeted neurones. To investigate the role of age-dependent autonomic dysfunction, 7 young (2-3 months) and 8 old (12-16 months) wild type (WT) and triple-synuclein-null (TKO) mice were studied. The animals underwent programmed electrical stimulation of the right ventricle under urethane anaesthesia (1.3g/kg) to obtain ventricular effective refractory period (VERP). Ventricular tachycardia (VT) inducibility by burst pacing was also assessed in the acute rat models. Results: Acute inhibition of the DVMN vagal preganglionic neurones in rats resulted in shortening of the VERP (32.6 + 0.8 vs 41.5 + 0.5 ms; p ¼ 0.002) and lowered VT threshold on burst pacing (21.7 + 4.2 vs 44.4 + 8.9 Hz; p ¼ 0.043). Young TKO mice showed no difference in VERP (37.0 + 5.2 vs 37.0 + 3.1 ms). However, development of autonomic dysfunc-tion in older TKO mice was associated with a reduction in VERP (30.6 + 2.3 vs 43.4 + 2.3 ms; p ¼ 0.003). In old WT animals, systemic administration of methylatropine (2mg/kg) mimicked the pro-arrhythmic phenotype of synuclein deficiency with significant VERP shortening (31.0 + 2.6 vs 43.4 + 2.3 ms; p ¼ 0.004). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that both acute and chronic decrease in activity of a distinct population of vagal preganglionic neurones in the DVMN predisposes the heart to ven-tricular arrhythmia by reduction of the effective refractory period. CNS disorders associated with autonomic dysfunction (mimicked here by synuclein deficiency) and decreased DVMN activity may lead to pro-arrhythmic phenotype.},

abstract = {Concomitant with the development of surgical treatment of cardiac arrythmias and management of myocardial ischemia, there is renewed interest in morphology of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system. In this study, we analyze the topography and structure of the human epicardiac neural plexus (ENP) as a system of seven ganglionated subplexuses. The morphology of the ENP was revealed by a histochemical method for acetylcholinesterase in whole hearts of 21 humans and examined by stereoscopic, contact, and bright-field microscopy. According to criteria established to distinguish ganglionated subplexuses, they are epicardiac extensions of mediastinal nerves entering the heart through discrete sites of the heart hilum and proceeding separately into regions of innervation by seven pathways, on the courses of which epicardiac ganglia, as wide ganglionated fields, are plentifully located. It was established that topography of epicardiac subplexuses was consistent from heart to heart. In general, the human right atrium was innervated by two subplexuses, the left atrium by three, the right ventricle by one, and the left ventricle by three subplexuses. The highest density of epicardiac ganglia was identified near the heart hilum, especially on the dorsal and dorsolateral surfaces of the left atrium, where up to 50{\%} of all cardiac ganglia were located. The number of epicardiac ganglia identified for the human hearts in this study ranged from 706 up to 1,560 and was not correlated with age in most heart regions. The human heart contained on average 836 +/- 76 epicardiac ganglia. The structural organization of ganglia and nerves within subplexuses was observed to vary considerably from heart to heart and in relation to age. The number of neurons identified for any epicardiac ganglion was significantly fewer in aged human compared with infants. By estimating the number of neurons within epicardiac ganglia and relating this to the number of ganglia in the human epicardium, it was calculated that approximately 43,000 intrinsic neurons might be present in the ENP in adult hearts and 94,000 neurons in young hearts (fetuses, neonates, and children). In conclusion, this study demonstrates the total ENP in humans using staining for acetylcholinesterase, and provides a morphological framework for an understanding of how intrinsic ganglia and nerves are structurally organized within the human heart.},

abstract = {A number of neurologic disorders can cause cardiac dysfunction by involving the conductive system and contractile apparatus of the heart. This is especially prominent in the neurocritical care setting where the spectrum of cardiac dysfunction due to acute neurologic injury ranges from trivial and isolated electrocardiographic changes to malignant arrhythmias and sudden death (Table 1). The mechanism of these cardiac complications is complex and not fully understood. An understanding of the neuroanatomical structures and pathways is of immense importance to comprehend the underlying pathophysiology that culminates as cardiac damage and dysregulation. Once the process is initiated, it can complicate and adversely affect the outcome of primary neurologic conditions commonly seen in the neurocritical care setting. Not only are these cardiac disorders under-recognized, there is a paucity of data to formulate evidence-based guidelines regarding early detection, acute management, and preventive strategies. However, certain details of clinical features and their course combined with location of primary neurologic lesion on neuroimaging and data obtained from laboratory investigations can be of great value to develop a strategy to appropriately manage these patients and to prevent adverse outcome from these cardiac complications. In this review, we highlight the mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction due to catastrophic neurologic conditions or due to stress of critical illness. We also address various clinical syndromes of cardiac dysfunction that occur as a result of the neurologic illness and in turn may complicate the course of the primary neurologic condition.},

abstract = {The co-transmitter neuropeptide Y (NPY), released during prolonged cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation, can attenuate vagal-induced bradycardia. We tested the hypothesis that NPY reduces acetylcholine release, at similar concentrations to which it attenuates vagal bradycardia, via pre-synaptic Y2 receptors modulating a pathway that is dependent on protein kinase A (PKA) or protein kinase C (PKC). The Y2 receptor was immunofluorescently colocalized with choline acetyl-transferase containing neurons at the guinea pig sinoatrial node. The effect of NPY in the presence of various enzyme inhibitors was then tested on the heart rate response to vagal nerve stimulation in isolated guinea pig sinoatrial node/right vagal nerve preparations and also on 3H-acetylcholine release from right atria during field stimulation. NPY reduced the heart rate response to vagal stimulation at 1, 3 and 5 Hz (significant at 100 nM and reaching a plateau at 250 nM NPY, p {\textless} 0.05, n = 6) but not to the stable analogue of acetylcholine, carbamylcholine (30, 60 or 90 nM, n = 6) which produced similar degrees of bradycardia. The reduced vagal response was abolished by the Y2 receptor antagonist BIIE 0246 (1 $\mu$M, n = 4). NPY also significantly attenuated the release of 3H-acetylcholine during field stimulation (250 nM, n = 6). The effect of NPY (250 nM) on vagal bradycardia was abolished by the PKC inhibitors calphostin C (0.1 $\mu$M, n = 5) and chelerythrine chloride (25 $\mu$M, n = 6) but not the PKA inhibitor H89 (0.5 $\mu$M, n = 6). Conversely, the PKC activator Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (0.5 $\mu$M, n = 7) mimicked the effect of NPY and significantly reduced 3H-acetylcholine release during field stimulation. These results show that NPY attenuates vagal bradycardia via a pre-synaptic decrease in acetylcholine release that appears to be mediated by a Y2 receptor pathway involving modulation of PKC. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In this paper the experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis that excitatory sympathetic reflexes may participate in the tonic control of the cardiovascular system is discussed. Positive feedback pressor sympathetic reflexes can be obtained with physiological distensions of the descending thoracic aorta in conscious dogs with all nerves intact in absence of any pain reaction. These excitatory reflexes interact with supraspinal regulatory mechanisms, inhibitory in nature. A massive excitation of cardiac sympathetic afferents, produced by intracoronary injections of bradykinin, also elicits a pressor reflex, without pain reactions. In the absence of anesthesia and recent surgery, the cardiovascular excitatory reflexes, subserved by sympathetic afferent fibers, can easily prevail. We suggest that negative and positive feedback mechanisms interact continuously to achieve the most adequate neural cardiovascular control.},

abstract = {editor ANESTHESIOLOGY, V XXX • NO XXX XXX 2019 1 T horacic epidural anesthesia is widely applied in tho-racic and abdominal surgical procedures, because it provides excellent analgesia and decreases postoperative pulmonary complications. 1,2 Epidural anesthesia with local anesthetics produces sensory and motor blockade but also affects the autonomic nervous system. The resultant effects on the cardiovascular system vary with the level and the extent of sympathetic blockade. Involvement of the lower thoracic region (T6 to L1) by thoracic epidural anesthesia is associated with increased venous capacitance and redistribution of blood to the dilated splanchnic veins. This results in decreased venous return to the heart and a reduction of cardiac preload. 3 Arterial vasodilation in blocked segments is counteracted by compensatory vasoconstriction in unblocked segments, and the effect on cardiac afterload depends on the balance between blocked and unblocked segments. 4 Direct effects of cardiac sympatholysis have not been the subject of detailed investigation. Many studies quantified the cardiac effects of thoracic epidural anesthesia using load-dependent indices of contractile performance, which does not allow differentiation between direct and indirect effects. Regardless, the effects of thoracic epidural anesthesia have generally been considered beneficial to the cardiovascular system and protective against surgical stress. 5 Interestingly, recent systematic reviews have not been able to confirm improved cardiac outcome in surgical patients treated with thoracic epidural anesthesia. 6 In contrast, some evidence was found for increased cardiovascular problems in high-risk patients receiving neuraxial block. 7,8 In light of these concerns, a reappraisal of the cardiovascular effects associated with the use of thoracic epidural anesthesia seems appropriate. Since the last published review on this subject, 9 new data have emerged from experimental and clinical studies addressing previously unexplored domains such as the effects of cardiac sympathectomy on right ven-tricular function, an important determinant of outcome in surgery. 10-12 We conducted the present review to update the knowledge in this field, with focus on the effects associated with high-thoracic epidural anesthesia and cardiac sympa-thectomy in the normal and diseased cardiovascular system. Materials and Methods The databases PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane were searched by the author and by an independent expert librarian to identify studies in which the cardiac sympathetic nerves (T1 to T5) are involved in neural blockade by thoracic epidural anesthesia. An extensive list of used ABStRAct Cardiac sympathetic blockade with high-thoracic epidural anesthesia is considered beneficial in patients undergoing major surgery because it offers protection in ischemic heart disease. Major outcome studies have failed to confirm such a benefit, however. In fact, there is growing concern about potential harm associated with the use of thoracic epidural anesthesia in high-risk patients, although underlying mechanisms have not been identified. Since the latest review on this subject, a number of clinical and experimental studies have provided new information on the complex interaction between thoracic epidural anesthesia-induced sympatholysis and cardiovascular control mechanisms. Perhaps these new insights may help identify conditions in which benefits of thoracic epidural anesthesia may not outweigh potential risks. For example, cardiac sympathectomy with high-thoracic epidural anesthesia decreases right ventricular function and attenuates its capacity to cope with increased right ventricular afterload. Although the clinical significance of this pathophysiologic interaction is unknown at present, it identifies a subgroup of patients with established or pending pulmonary hypertension for whom outcome studies are needed. Other new areas of interest include the impact of thoracic epidural anesthesia-induced sympatholysis on cardiovascular control in conditions associated with increased sympathetic tone, surgical stress, and hemodynamic disruption. It was considered appropriate to collect and analyze all recent scientific information on this subject to provide a comprehensive update on the cardiovascular effects of high-thoracic epidural anesthesia and cardiac sympathectomy in healthy and diseased patients.},

The nucleus ambiguus provides fibers that innervate the somatic muscles of the pharynx, larynx, and soft palate.

abstract = {The rich autonomic innervation of the heart plays an important role in modifying cardiovascular function. Recently developed in vivo scintigraphic imaging techniques allow for visualization of the autonomic innervation of the heart. Studies using the modalities have shown heterogeneity of sympathetic innervation in various kinds of pathological conditions as well as normal human heart. The inferioposterior region shows typically less sympathetic innervation than the anterior region. In addition, neuropathic processes appear to commence in inferior-apical regions extending towards the base of the heart. Arrhythmogeneity has been related to the heterogeneous innervation of the heart and heterogeneous uptake of radiolabeled catecholamine analogues, such as I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine, can be found in patients with arrhythmia. In dilated cardiomyopathy, reduced uptake indicates a poor prognosis which allows risk stratification for patients with heart failure. Heterogeneity of the reinnervation process following heart transplantation has also been investigated. Evidence was found of reinnervation primarily in the basal anterioseptal region and to a lesser degree in the inferioposterior and apical regions. Tracer approaches are uniquely suited to identify regionally altered innervation and provide tools for linking information on cardiac autonomic innervation with other clinical aspects.},

Implantable devices for VNS are approved therapy for refractory epilepsy and for treatment-resistant depression. In the case of heart disease applications, implantable VNS has been shown to be beneficial for treating heart failure in both preclinical and clinical studies. Adverse effects of implantable VNS therapy systems are generally associated with the implantation procedure or continuous on-off stimulation. The most serious implantation-associated adverse effect is infection. The effectiveness of non-invasive transcutaneous VNS for epilepsy, depression, primary headaches, heart failure, and other conditions remains under investigation. VNS merits further study for its potentially favorable effects on cardiovascular disease, especially heart failure.},

abstract = {Starting from the late embryonic development, the sympathetic nervous system extensively innervates the heart and modulates its activity during the entire lifespan. The distribution of myocardial sympathetic processes is finely regulated by the secretion of limiting amounts of pro-survival neurotrophic factors by cardiac cells. Norepinephrine release by the neurons rapidly modulates myocardial electrophysiology, and increases the rate and force of cardiomyocyte contractions. Sympathetic processes establish direct interaction with cardiomyocytes, characterized by the presence of neurotransmitter vesicles and reduced cell-cell distance. Whether such contacts have a functional role in both neurotrophin- and catecholamine-dependent communication between the two cell types, is poorly understood. In this review we will address the effects of the sympathetic neuron activity on the myocardium and the hypothesis that the direct neuro-cardiac contact might have a key role both in norepinephrine and neurotrophin mediated signaling.

abstract = {Myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with remodeling of the heart and neurohumoral control systems. The objective of this study was to define time-dependent changes in intrinsic cardiac (IC) neuronal excitability, synaptic efficacy, and neurochemical modulation following MI. MI was produced in guinea pigs by ligation of the coronary artery and associated vein on the dorsal surface of the heart. Animals were recovered for 4, 7, 14, or 50. days. Intracellular voltage recordings were obtained in whole mounts of the cardiac neuronal plexus to determine passive and active neuronal properties of IC neurons. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated an immediate and persistent increase in the percentage of IC neurons immunoreactive for neuronal nitric oxide synthase. Examination of individual neuronal properties demonstrated that afterhyperpolarizing potentials were significantly decreased in both amplitude and time course of recovery at 7. days post-MI. These parameters returned to control values by 50. days post-MI. Synaptic efficacy, as determined by the stimulation of axonal inputs, was enhanced at 7. days post-MI only. Neuronal excitability in absence of agonist challenge was unchanged following MI. Norepinephrine increased IC excitability to intracellular current injections, a response that was augmented post-MI. Angiotensin II potentiation of norepinephrine and bethanechol-induced excitability, evident in controls, was abolished post-MI. This study demonstrates that MI induces both persistent and transient changes in IC neuronal functions immediately following injury. Alterations in the IC neuronal network, which persist for weeks after the initial insult, may lead to alterations in autonomic signaling and cardiac control. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This review examines how the sympathetic nervous system plays a major role in the regulation of cardiovascular function over multiple time scales. This is achieved through differential regulation of sympathetic outflow to a variety of organs. This differential control is a product of the topographical organization of the central nervous system and a myriad of afferent inputs. Together this organization produces sympathetic responses tailored to match stimuli. The long-term control of sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) is an area of considerable interest and involves a variety of mediators acting in a quite distinct fashion. These mediators include arterial baroreflexes, angiotensin II, blood volume and osmolarity, and a host of humoral factors. A key feature of many cardiovascular diseases is increased SNA. However, rather than there being a generalized increase in SNA, it is organ specific, in particular to the heart and kidneys. These increases in regional SNA are associated with increased mortality. Understanding the regulation of organ-specific SNA is likely to offer new targets for drug therapy. There is a need for the research community to develop better animal models and technologies that reflect the disease progression seen in humans. A particular focus is required on models in which SNA is chronically elevated. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract = {Blood pressure is usually well maintained during epidural or spinal anesthesia even in the presence of extensive sympathetic blockade. The authors investigated whether hormonal systems support arterial pressure and how the circulation copes with a hypoxic challenge when activation of the sympathetic nervous system is selectively impaired by neural blockade. Accordingly, the effects of high epidural anesthesia alone and combined with hypoxia were evaluated in seven awake trained dogs. On different days, either bupivacaine 0.5{\%} (8-12 ml) or saline (placebo) were randomly injected epidurally and the effects evaluated on cardiovascular (arterial pressure, heart rate) and respiratory (blood gases, oxygen consumption) variables, as well as on hormone plasma concentrations (vasopressin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, renin) during both normoxia and hypoxia. During epidural anesthesia alone, vasopressin increased tenfold (1.7 pg/ml ± 1.0 SD to 16.8 ± 13.8 P {\textless} 0.05), norepinephrine decreased (90 pg/ml ± 31 to 61 ± 28, P {\textless} 0.05) while epinephrine and renin concentrations remained unchanged. Mean arterial and pulse pressure decreased by 13 mmHg and 23 mmHg (P {\textless} 0.05), respectively. In dogs without sympathetic blockade (saline group), hypoxemia (Pa(O2): 31 ± 4 mmHg) evoked an increase in mean blood pressure by 37 mmHg ± 8 and heart rate by 50 beats per min ± 17. In contrast, in the presence of sympathetic blockade but with a similar degree of hypoxemia, blood pressure failed to increase (+1 mmHg ± 14) and heart rate rose by only 15 beats per min ± 11. These differences between groups were statistically significant (P {\textless} 0.001). Hypoxemia induced a similar hypocarbia (Pa(CO2): 25 mmHg) in both groups, indicating that the ventilatory response to hypoxemia was preserved after epidural blockade. During hypoxemia vasopressin concentrations increased 35-fold to 64 pg/ml ± 38 (P {\textless} 0.0001) compared to base line only during epidural anesthesia, but not after epidural saline (2 pg/ml ± 2), while other hormones showed no significant differences. The authors conclude that high epidural anesthesia in awake unsedated dogs: 1) almost completely abolishes the normal cardiovascular response to hypoxemia while promoting vasopressin secretion; 2) preserves the ventilatory response to hypoxemia; and 3) is associated with increased vasopressin concentrations, most likely to compensate for decreased cardiac filling and/or arterial blood pressure when sympathoadrenal responses are impaired. Thus, the changes in cardiovascular vital signs in response to severe hypoxemia are markedly blunted when spinal sympathetic outflow is selectively eliminated by epidural anesthesia.},

abstract = {During the classic "fight-or-flight" stress response, sympathetic nervous system activation leads to catecholamine release, which increases heart rate and contractility, resulting in enhanced cardiac output. Catecholamines bind to $\beta$-adrenergic receptors, causing cAMP generation and activation of PKA, which phosphorylates multiple targets in cardiac muscle, including the cardiac ryanodine receptor/calcium release channel (RyR2) required for muscle contraction. PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 enhances channel activity by sensitizing the channel to cytosolic calcium (Ca²+). Here, we found that mice harboring RyR2 channels that cannot be PKA phosphorylated (referred to herein as RyR2-S2808A+/+ mice) exhibited blunted heart rate and cardiac contractile responses to catecholamines (isoproterenol). The isoproterenol-induced enhancement of ventricular myocyte Ca²+ transients and fractional shortening (contraction) and the spontaneous beating rate of sinoatrial nodal cells were all blunted in RyR2-S2808A+/+ mice. The blunted cardiac response to catecholamines in RyR2-S2808A+/+ mice resulted in impaired exercise capacity. RyR2-S2808A+/+ mice were protected against chronic catecholaminergic-induced cardiac dysfunction. These studies identify what we believe to be new roles for PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 in both the heart rate and contractile responses to acute catecholaminergic stimulation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Mechanisms favoring the occurrence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) are complex and poorly defined. This study was designed to analyze dynamic changes in autonomic tone preceding the onset of PAF in a large group of patients. METHODS AND RESULTS Holter tapes from 77 unselected consecutive patients (63 men and 14 women aged 58+/-12 years) with PAF were analyzed. A total of 147 episodes of sustained AF ({\textgreater}30 minutes) were recorded and submitted to time-domain and frequency-domain heart rate variability analyses; 6 periods were studied using repeated measures ANOVA: the 24-hour period, the hour preceding PAF, and the 20 minutes before PAF divided into four 5-minute periods. In the time-domain analyses, a linear decrease in mean RR interval from 925+/-16 to 906+/-16 ms (P{\textless}0.0002) was observed before the onset of PAF, together with a significant increase in the standard deviation of NN intervals from 65+/-4 to 70+/-4 ms (P{\textless}0.02). In the frequency-domain analyses, a significant increase in high-frequency (HF, HF-NU) components was observed before PAF (P{\textless}0.001 and P{\textless}0.0001, respectively), together with a progressive decrease in low-frequency components (LF, LF-NU) (P{\textless}0.0001 and P{\textless}0.004, respectively). The low/high frequency ratio showed a linear increase until 10 minutes before PAF, followed by a sharp decrease immediately before PAF, suggesting a primary increase in adrenergic tone followed by a marked modulation toward vagal predominance. No difference was observed in these heart rate variability changes between patients with "lone" PAF and patients with structural heart disease. CONCLUSIONS The occurrence of PAF greatly depends on variations of the autonomic tone, with a primary increase in adrenergic tone followed by an abrupt shift toward vagal predominance.},

abstract = {This research was designed to compare coronary, carotid and aortic arch baroreceptors in terms of the ranges of pressures required to elicit reflex vascular responses and the possible differences between the responses to pulsatile and non-pulsatile stimuli. Dogs were anaesthetized with alpha-chloralose, artificially ventilated and the chests opened wide. A perfusion circuit allowed independent control of pressures distending the three baroreceptor regions. A cardiopulmonary bypass and ventricular fibrillation prevented cardiac pulsations from influencing coronary baroreceptor pressure. The caudal region of the animal was perfused at constant flow and vascular resistance responses were assessed from changes in perfusion pressure. Only tests in which the overall response exceeded 3 kPa (22.5 mmHg) were analyzed. Reflex responses were obtained to significantly lower coronary pressures than were required to induce responses from other regions. The inflexion points of the stimulus-response curves for pulsatile coronary, carotid and aortic pressures were 10.5 +/- 0.6, 15.5 +/- 1.8 and 16.4 +/- 1.7 kPa (79 +/- 5, 116 +/- 14 and 123 +/- 13 mmHg, respectively; values are means +/- S.E.M.). When the responses to pulsatile stimuli were compared with those to non-pulsatile stimuli, it was noted that for the carotid receptors, lower pressures were required to induce responses (inflexion pressure less) and the slope of the stimulus-response curve was less. Pulsatile aortic pressures induced a parallel (downward) displacement of the curve but no change in inflexion point or slope. The coronary baroreceptor stimulus-response relationship was unaffected by pulsatility. These results show differences between the characteristics of the three baroreceptors with coronary receptors being unaffected by pressure pulsatility but likely to be of importance in hypotensive situations.},

abstract = {Changes of the electrocardiogram and of ventricular refractory period were measured following either unilateral stellate ganglion stimulation or ablation in the open chest dog preparation. Right stellate ganglionectomy or left stellate stimulation produces prolonged Q-T intervals and increased T-wave amplitude. Left stellate ganglionectomy or right stellate stimulation produces increased T-wave negativity without measurable change in the Q-T interval. The differing patterns of electrocardiographic wave form resulting from changes in sympathetic tone mediated by right and left stellate innervation could be correlated with changes in ventricular refractory period. Following right stellate ganglionectomy, refractory period prolongations were most marked over the anterior ventricular surface; left stellate ganglionectomy produced the greatest prolongation on the posterior surface. Although the right and left stellate innervations of the ventricles overlap, the left stellate influence is predominant over the posterior wall of the ventricles, while right stellate influence dominates the anterior ventricular walls. The electrocardiographic form changes observed following unilateral alteration of sympathetic tone paralleled those electrocardiographic abnormalities seen in patients with lesions of the central nervous system, suggesting a possible functional explanation for these clinical findings.},

@article{Herring2012,
abstract = {The autonomic phenotype of congestive cardiac failure is characterised by high sympathetic drive and impaired vagal tone, which are independent predictors of mortality. We hypothesize that impaired bradycardia to peripheral vagal stimulation following high-level sympathetic drive is due to sympatho-vagal crosstalk by the adrenergic co-transmitters galanin and neuropeptide-Y (NPY). Moreover we hypothesize that galanin acts similarly to NPY by reducing vagal acetylcholine release via a receptor mediated, protein kinase-dependent pathway. Prolonged right stellate ganglion stimulation (10Hz, 2min, in the presence of 10$\mu$M metoprolol) in an isolated guinea pig atrial preparation with dual autonomic innervation leads to a significant (p{\textless}0.05) reduction in the magnitude of vagal bradycardia (5Hz) maintained over the subsequent 20min (n=6). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of galanin in a small number of tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons from freshly dissected stellate ganglion tissue sections. Following 3days of tissue culture however, most stellate neurons expressed galanin. Stellate stimulation caused the release of low levels of galanin and significantly higher levels of NPY into the surrounding perfusate (n=6, using ELISA). The reduction in vagal bradycardia post sympathetic stimulation was partially reversed by the galanin receptor antagonist M40 after 10min (1$\mu$M, n=5), and completely reversed with the NPY Y 2 receptor antagonist BIIE 0246 at all time points (1$\mu$M, n=6). Exogenous galanin (n=6, 50-500nM) also reduced the heart rate response to vagal stimulation but had no effect on the response to carbamylcholine that produced similar degrees of bradycardia (n=6). Galanin (500nM) also significantly attenuated the release of 3H-acetylcholine from isolated atria during field stimulation (5Hz, n=5). The effect of galanin on vagal bradycardia could be abolished by the galanin receptor antagonist M40 (n=5). Importantly the GalR 1 receptor was immunofluorescently co-localised with choline acetyl-transferase containing neurons at the sinoatrial node. The protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin (100nM, n=6) abolished the effect of galanin on vagal bradycardia whilst the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 (500nM, n=6) had no effect. These results demonstrate that prolonged sympathetic activation releases the slowly diffusing adrenergic co-transmitter galanin in addition to NPY, and that this contributes to the attenuation in vagal bradycardia via a reduction in acetylcholine release. This effect is mediated by GalR 1 receptors on vagal neurons coupled to protein kinase C dependent signalling pathways. The role of galanin may become more important following an acute injury response where galanin expression is increased. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Background-T-wave alternans (TWA) increases before ventricular tachycardia (VT) or fibrillation (VF), suggesting that it may warn of VT/VF in implantable cardioverter-defibrillator patients. Recently, we described a method for measuring alternans and nonalternans variability (TWA/V) from electrograms (EGMs) stored in implantable cardioverter-defibrillators before VT/VF. The goal of this prospective, multicenter study was to determine whether EGM TWA/V was greater before VT/VF than at baseline. Methods and Results-We enrolled 63 implantable cardioverter-defibrillator patients. TWA/V was computed from stored EGMs before spontaneous VT/VF and from sequential windows of 8 pairs of beats using 4 different control recordings: baseline rhythm, rapid pacing at 105 bpm, segments of ambulatory Holter EGMs matched to the time of VT/VF episodes, and EGMs before spontaneous supraventricular tachycardia. During follow-up, 28 patients had 166 episodes of VT/VF. TWA/V was greater before VT/VF (62.9±3.1 $\mu$V; n=28) than during baseline rhythm (12.8±1.8 $\mu$V; P{\textless}0.0001; n=62), during rapid pacing (14.5±2.0 $\mu$V; P{\textless}0.0001; n=52), before supraventricular tachycardia (27.5±6.1 $\mu$V; P{\textless}0.0001; n=9), or during time-matched ambulatory controls (12.3±3.5 $\mu$V; P{\textless}0.0001; n=16). By logistic regression, the odds of VT/VF increased by a factor of 2.2 for each 10-$\mu$V increment in TWA/V (P{\textless}0.0001). Conclusions-In implantable cardioverter-defibrillator patients, EGM TWA/V is greater before spontaneous VT/VF than in control recordings. Future implantable cardioverter-defibrillators that measure EGM TWA/V continuously may warn patients and initiate pacing therapies to prevent VT/VF. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Heart Association.

@article{Parsons2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prevention of obesity has focused on childhood as a target period. Our aim was to assess whether frequency of adolescent physical activity affected subsequent body mass index (BMI) gain through to mid-adulthood. METHODS: The British birth cohort of all births in 1 week in March 1958, includes information on physical activity frequency and BMI for several ages, 11-45 years. We examined relationships between activity in adolescence and trajectories of BMI between 16 years (or 23 years) and 45 years using multi-level models. Effects of change in activity on BMI and on change in BMI were tested using ANOVA. RESULTS: Physical activity at 11 years had no effect on the BMI trajectories, in males or females. More active females at 16 years gained BMI more slowly than others, by 0.007 kg/m2/year per activity category over the period 16-45 years, whereas the most active males gained BMI faster than others, by 0.005 kg/m2/year per activity category. This effect in males was not evident on the BMI trajectory from 23 to 45 years. Consistent with these analyses, change in activity was associated with change in BMI in females, e.g. females active at 16 and 42 years gained less BMI than inactive females (2.1 vs 2.5 kg/m2/10 years). Results for males were inconsistent over the time periods examined. CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity may lessen the gains in BMI from adolescence onwards, but relationships vary with age, and in later adolescence show opposite effects for males and females. Decreasing activity between adolescence and mid-adulthood in males, and inactivity in both life stages in females may increase BMI gain.},

Advanced single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) using the radiopharmaceuticals, 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) and 11C-hydroxyephedrine (11C-HED), have shown that dysfunction of cardiac sympathetic nerves is present to a large extent in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The pattern of sympathetic disturbances is heterogeneous with a predominant effect in the posterior myocardial region. Furthermore, myocardial blood flow assessment with PET has shown that endothelial-dependent vasodilatation is reduced in proportion to the magnitude of cardiac sympathetic dysfunction.

abstract = {Autonomic imbalances including parasympathetic withdrawal and sympathetic overactivity are cardinal features of heart failure regardless of etiology; however, mechanisms underlying these imbalances remain unknown. Animal model studies of heart and visceral organ hypertrophy predict that nerve growth factor levels should be elevated in heart failure; whether this is so in human heart failure, though, remains unclear. We tested the hypotheses that neurons in cardiac ganglia are hypertrophied in human, canine, and rat heart failure and that nerve growth factor, which we hypothesize is elevated in the failing heart, contributes to this neuronal hypertrophy. Somal morphology of neurons from human (579.54±14.34 versus 327.45±9.17 $\mu$m(2); P{\textless}0.01) and canine hearts (767.80±18.37 versus 650.23±9.84 $\mu$m(2); P{\textless}0.01) failing secondary to ischemia and neurons from spontaneously hypertensive rat hearts (327.98±3.15 versus 271.29±2.79 $\mu$m(2); P{\textless}0.01) failing secondary to hypertension reveal significant hypertrophy of neurons in cardiac ganglia compared with controls. Western blot analysis shows that nerve growth factor levels in the explanted, failing human heart are 250{\%} greater than levels in healthy donor hearts. Neurons from cardiac ganglia cultured with nerve growth factor are significantly larger and have greater dendritic arborization than neurons in control cultures. Hypertrophied neurons are significantly less excitable than smaller ones; thus, hypertrophy of vagal postganglionic neurons in cardiac ganglia would help to explain the parasympathetic withdrawal that accompanies heart failure. Furthermore, our observations suggest that nerve growth factor, which is elevated in the failing human heart, causes hypertrophy of neurons in cardiac ganglia.},

abstract = {Aims Previous studies showed that autonomic activation by high-frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) during myocardial refractoriness evokes rapid firing from pulmonary vein (PV) and atria, both in vitro and in vivo. This study sought to investigate the autonomic mechanism underlying the rapid firings at various sites by systematic ablation of multiple ganglionated plexi (GP).Methods and resultsIn 43 mongrel dogs, rapid firing-mediated atrial fibrillation (AF) was induced by local HFS (200 Hz, impulse duration 0.1 ms, train duration 40 ms) to the PVs and atria during myocardial refractoriness. The main GP in the atrial fat pads or the ganglia along the ligament of Marshall (LOM) were then ablated. Ablation of the anterior right GP and inferior right GP significantly increased the AF threshold by HFS at the right atrium and PVs. The AF threshold at left atrium and PVs was significantly increased by ablation of the superior left GP and inferior left GP, and was further increased by ablation of the LOM. Ablation of left-or right-sided GP on the atria had a significant effect on contralateral PVs and atrium. Administration of esmolol (1 mg/kg) or atropine (1 mg) significantly increased AF threshold at all sites.ConclusionHFS applied to local atrial and PV sites initiated rapid firing via activation of the interactive autonomic network in the heart. GP in either left side or right side contributes to the rapid firings and AF originating from ipsolateral and contralateral PVs and atrium. Autonomic denervation suppresses or eliminates those rapid firings.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.Rationale: Catecholamines increase cardiac contractility, but exposure to high concentrations or prolonged exposures can cause cardiac injury. A recent study demonstrated that a single subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (ISO; 200 mg/kg) in mice causes acute myocyte death (8{\%}-10{\%}) with complete cardiac repair within a month. Cardiac regeneration was via endogenous cKit+ cardiac stem cell-mediated new myocyte formation. Objective: Our goal was to validate this simple injury/regeneration system and use it to study the biology of newly forming adult cardiac myocytes. Methods and Results: C57BL/6 mice (n=173) were treated with single injections of vehicle, 200 or 300 mg/kg ISO, or 2 daily doses of 200 mg/kg ISO for 6 days. Echocardiography revealed transiently increased systolic function and unaltered diastolic function 1 day after single ISO injection. Single ISO injections also caused membrane injury in ≈10{\%} of myocytes, but few of these myocytes appeared to be necrotic. Circulating troponin I levels after ISO were elevated, further documenting myocyte damage. However, myocyte apoptosis was not increased after ISO injury. Heart weight to body weight ratio and fibrosis were also not altered 28 days after ISO injection. Single- or multiple-dose ISO injury was not associated with an increase in the percentage of 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine-labeled myocytes. Furthermore, ISO injections did not increase new myocytes in cKit+/Cre×R-GFP transgenic mice. Conclusions: A single dose of ISO causes injury in ≈10{\%} of the cardiomyocytes. However, most of these myocytes seem to recover and do not elicit cKit+ cardiac stem cell-derived myocyte regeneration.},

abstract = {Francis A. Bainbridge demonstrated in 1915 that an infusion of saline or blood into the jugular vein of the anesthetized dog produced tachycardia. His findings after transection of the cardiac autonomic nerve supply and injection of the cholinergic blocking drug atropine demonstrated that the tachycardia was reflex in origin, with the vagus nerves constituting the afferent limb and a withdrawal of vagal tone the primary efferent limb. Subsequent investigators demonstrated that the increase in venous return was detected by stretch receptors in the right and left atria. In the 1980s, it was shown convincingly that the Bainbridge reflex was present in primates, including humans, but that the reflex was much less prominent than in the dog. This difference may be due to a more dominant arterial baroreceptor reflex in humans. A "reverse" Bainbridge reflex has been proposed to explain the decreases in heart rate observed under conditions in which venous return is reduced, such as during spinal and epidural anesthesia, controlled hypotension, and severe hemorrhage. The Bainbridge reflex is invoked throughout the anesthesia literature to describe the effect of changes in venous return on heart rate in patients in the surgical and critical care settings, but a critical analysis of the experimental and clinical evidence is lacking. Our main objectives in this review are to summarize the history of the Bainbridge reflex, to describe its anatomy and physiology, and to discuss the evidence for and against it having an influence on heart rate changes observed clinically. The interaction of the Bainbridge reflex with the arterial baroreceptor and Bezold-Jarisch reflexes is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Anesthesia Research Society.},

abstract = {Background Patients with microvascular angina (exertional angina, positive exercise tests and normal coronary arteriograms) usually have a reduced coronary blood flow reserve. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a potent endogenous vasoconstrictor involved in modulation of coronary vasomotor tone and may play a role in microvascular angina. Methods We compared the effects of NPY (0.2–1.0 pmol/kg, intracoronary) on the vasomotor response of proximal and distal segments of the coronary arteries in 7 patients with microvascular angina, 9 with chronic stable angina, and 9 control individuals. The coronary response to the administration of ergonovine was also assessed in 9 other patients with microvascular angina. Computerized coronary artery diameter measurements were carried out before (baseline) and after the administration of the vasoactive agents. Results Mean baseline coronary lumen diameters were similar in control, microvascular angina, and coronary artery disease patients. NPY constricted proximal coronary segments by 8 ± 2{\%}, 5 ± 2{\%} and 6 ± 3{\%} and distal segments by 14 ± 2{\%}, 11 ± 2{\%} and 10 ± 2{\%} in control, microvascular angina, and coronary artery disease patients, respectively (p = NS between groups). In patients with microvascular angina, ergonovine constricted proximal coronary segments by 7 ± 1.5{\%} and distal segments by 12.5 ± 3{\%} (p = NS vs. NPY). During NPY administration four microvascular angina patients developed chest pain, ST segment depression, and a marked lengthening of the contrast medium run off, in the absence of epicardial coronary artery spasm. Control individuals and coronary artery disease patients did not experience chest pain, ST segment shifts, or lengthening of the run off during NPY administration. Ergonovine administration caused chest pain and lengthening of the contrast run-off, in the absence of epicardial coronary artery spasm, in one microvascular angina patient. Conclusions Exogenous NPY causes mild epicardial coronary artery constriction which is similar in patients with non-cardiac chest pain, microvascular angina and coronary artery disease. Myocardial ischemia and marked lengthening of the contrast run off in response to NPY occurred in microvascular angina patients but not in control or coronary artery disease patients. An abnormal constrictor response to NPY at the microcirculation level could be the mechanism underlying the ischemic manifestations observed in patients with microvascular angina. Condensed abstract (table of contents) The vasomotor response of proximal and distal coronary artery segments was studied in twenty five patients: 7 microvascular angina, 9 chronic stable angina, and 9 control subjects. Computerized measurements of coronary diameters were carried out before and after the intracoronary administration of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and ergonovine. Constriction of epicardial arteries in response to NPY was mild and not significantly different in control, microvascular angina and coronary artery disease patients. Ergonovine-induced epicardial coronary artery constriction was similar to that of NPY. However, NPY caused transient myocardial ischemia in patients with microvascular angina (probably through constriction of the small intramyocardial vessels), but not in control subjects or coronary artery disease patients.},

Adrenergic responsiveness is altered with aging and the age-related changes are limited to the $\beta$-adrenergic receptor density reduction and to the $\beta$-adrenoceptor-G-protein(s)-adenylyl cyclase system abnormalities, while the type and level of abnormalities change with species and tissues. Epidemiological studies have shown an high incidence and prevalence of heart failure in the elderly and a great body of evidence correlate the changes of $\beta$-adrenergic system with heart failure pathogenesis. In particular it is well known that: (a) levels of cathecolamines are directly correlated with mortality and functional status in heart failure, (b) $\beta$1-adrenergic receptor subtype is down-regulated in heart failure, (c) heart failure-dependent cardiac adrenergic responsiveness reduction is related to changes in G proteins activity. In this review we focus on the cardiovascular $\beta$-adrenergic changes involvement in the aging process and on similarities and differences between aging heart and heart failure.},

Its specific focus is on the phylogenetic shift between reptiles and mammals that resulted in specific changes to the vagal pathways regulating the heart. As the source nuclei of the primary vagal efferent pathways regulating the heart shifted from the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus in reptiles to the nucleus ambiguus in mammals, a face-heart connection evolved with emergent properties of a social engagement system that would enable social interactions to regulate visceral state. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Cleveland Clinic Foundation.},

abstract = {Background. Experimental evidence suggests that autonomic markers such as heart-rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) may contribute to post-infarction risk stratification. There are clinical data to support this concept for heart-rate variability. The main objective of the ATRAMI study was to provide prospective data on the additional and independent prognostic value for cardiac mortality of heart-rate variability and BRS in patients after myocardial infarction in whom left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and ventricular arrhythmias were known. Methods. This multicentre international prospective study enrolled 1284 patients with a recent ({\textless} 28 days) myocardial infarction, 24 h Holter recording was done to quantify heart-rate variability (measured as standard deviation of normal to normal RR intervals [SDNN]) and ventricular arrhythmias. BRS was calculated from measurement of the rate-pressure response to intravenous phenylephrine. Findings. During 21 (SD 8) months of follow-up, the primary endpoint, cardiac mortality, included 44 cardiac deaths and five non-fatal cardiac arrests. Low values of either heart-rate variability (SDNN {\textless} 70 ms) or BRS ({\textless} 3.0 ms per mmHg) carried a significant multivariate risk of cardiac mortality (3.2 [95{\%} CI 1.42-7.36] and 2.8 [1.24-6.16], respectively). The association of low SDNN and BRS further increased risk; the 2-year mortality was 17{\%} when both were below the cut-offs and 2{\%} (p {\textless} 0.0001) when both were well preserved (SDNN {\textgreater} 105 ms, BRS {\textgreater} 6.1 ms per mmHg). The association of low SDNN or BRS with LVEF below 35{\%} carried a relative risk of 6.7 (3.1-14.6) or 8.7 (4.3-17.6), respectively, compared with patients with LVEF above 35{\%} and less compromised SDNN ≤ 70 ms) and BRS (≤ 3 ms per mmHg). Interpretation. ATRAMI provides clinical evidence that after myocardial infarction the analysis of vagal reflexes has significant prognostic value independently of LVEF and of ventricular arrhythmias acid that it significantly adds to the prognostic value of heart-rate variability.},

abstract = {The sympathetic nervous system regulates cardiac function through the activation of adrenergic receptors (ARs). $\beta$1 and $\beta$2ARs are the primary sympathetic receptors in the heart and play different roles in regulating cardiac contractile function and remodeling in response to injury. In this study, we examine the targeting and trafficking of $\beta$1 and $\beta$2ARs at cardiac sympathetic synapses in vitro. Sympathetic neurons form functional synapses with neonatal cardiac myocytes in culture. The myocyte membrane develops into specialized zones that surround contacting axons and contain accumulations of the scaffold proteins SAP97 and AKAP79/150 but are deficient in caveolin-3. The $\beta$1ARs are enriched within these zones, whereas $\beta$2ARs are excluded from them after stimulation of neuronal activity. The results indicate that specialized signaling domains are organized in cardiac myocytes at sites of contact with sympathetic neurons and that these domains are likely to play a role in the subtype-specific regulation of cardiac function by $\beta$1 and $\beta$2ARs in vivo.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Physiological Society.Cardiac control is mediated via a series of reflex control networks involving somata in the (i) intrinsic cardiac ganglia (heart), (ii) intrathoracic extracardiac ganglia (stellate, middle cervical), (iii) superior cervical ganglia, (iv) spinal cord, (v) brainstem, and (vi) higher centers. Each of these processing centers contains afferent, efferent, and local circuit neurons, which interact locally and in an interdependent fashion with the other levels to coordinate regional cardiac electrical and mechanical indices on a beat-to-beat basis. This control system is optimized to respond to normal physiological stressors (standing, exercise, and temperature); however, it can be catastrophically disrupted by pathological events such as myocardial ischemia. In fact, it is now recognized that autonomic dysregulation is central to the evolution of heart failure and arrhythmias. Autonomic regulation therapy is an emerging modality in the management of acute and chronic cardiac pathologies. Neuromodulation-based approaches that target select nexus points of this hierarchy for cardiac control offer unique opportunities to positively affect therapeutic outcomes via improved efficacy of cardiovascular reflex control. As such, understanding the anatomical and physiological basis for such control is necessary to implement effectively novel neuromodulation therapies},

abstract = {Background: The role of cardiac sympathetic nerves in regulating coronary blood flow is controversial. We sought to determine the degree to which cardiac efferent sympathetic signals modulate coronary blood flow. The heterogeneous sympathetic reinnervation in transplanted hearts provides a model for studying the vasomotor responses to adrenergic stimulation in reinnervated and denervated coronary territories of the same heart. Methods: We studied 14 cardiac-transplant recipients who had normal coronary arteries and no evidence of rejection and 8 normal subjects. We used positron-emission tomography with [11C]hydroxyephedrine, an analogue of norepinephrine, to delineate sympathetic innervation. Using [13N]ammonia, we measured myocardial blood flow at rest, during adenosine-induced hyperemia, and in response to sympathetic stimulation induced by cold pressor testing. Results: In the transplant recipients, the uptake of [11C]hydroxyephedrine was greater in the territory served by the left anterior descending artery (mean±SE, 0.15±0.01) than in those served by the right coronary artery (0.07±0.01, P{\textless}0.001) or the circumflex artery (0.09±0.01, P{\textless}0.001). The basal flow was similar in all three regions, as was the percent increase in flow during hyperemia. However, the increase in flow in response to cold pressor testing was higher in the territory of the left anterior descending artery (46±10 percent) than in those of the right coronary artery (16±6 percent, P=0.01) or the circumflex artery (23±6 percent, P=0.06), although the changes in hemodynamics and levels of circulating catecholamines were similar. No such regional differences were observed in the normal subjects. Conclusions: Increases in coronary blood flow in response to sympathetic stimulation correlated with the regional norepinephrine content in the cardiac sympathetic-nerve terminals. These findings suggest that cardiac adrenergic signals play an important part in regulating myocardial blood flow.},

abstract = {The aims of the study were to determine how aggregates of intrinsic cardiac (IC) neurons transduce the cardiovascular milieu versus responding to changes in central neuronal drive and to determine IC network interactions subsequent to induced neural imbalances in the genesis of atrial fibrillation (AF). Activity from multiple IC neurons in the right atrial ganglionated plexus was recorded in eight anaesthetized canines using a 16-channel linear microelectrode array. Induced changes in IC neuronal activity were evaluated in response to: (1) focal cardiac mechanical distortion; (2) electrical activation of cervical vagi or stellate ganglia; (3) occlusion of the inferior vena cava or thoracic aorta; (4) transient ventricular ischaemia, and (5) neurally induced AF. Low level activity (ranging from 0 to 2.7 Hz) generated by 92 neurons was identified in basal states, activities that displayed functional interconnectivity. The majority (56{\%}) of IC neurons so identified received indirect central inputs (vagus alone: 25{\%}; stellate ganglion alone: 27{\%}; both: 48{\%}). Fifty per cent transduced the cardiac milieu responding to multimodal stressors applied to the great vessels or heart. Fifty per cent of IC neurons exhibited cardiac cycle periodicity, with activity occurring primarily in late diastole into isovolumetric contraction. Cardiac-related activity in IC neurons was primarily related to direct cardiac mechano-sensory inputs and indirect autonomic efferent inputs. In response to mediastinal nerve stimulation, most IC neurons became excessively activated; such network behaviour preceded and persisted throughout AF. It was concluded that stochastic interactions occur among IC local circuit neuronal populations in the control of regional cardiac function. Modulation of IC local circuit neuronal recruitment may represent a novel approach for the treatment of cardiac disease, including atrial arrhythmias. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

abstract = {We have demonstrated previously that sympathetic and vagal afferents travel in an apical-to-basal course in the heart, and can be stimulated selectively with epicardial applications of bradykinin and nicotine, respectively. In this study we tested the hypothesis that transmural myocardial infarction interrupts sympathetic and vagal afferent fibers traveling through the infarction and produces regions of afferent denervation in areas apical to the infarction. In open-chest, chloralose-anesthetized dogs, transmural myocardial infarction was created by embolizing a diagonal branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery with a vinyl latex solution that was injected directly into the artery and hardened rapidly. The transmural nature of the infarction was verified by the nitro blue tetrazolium staining technique for dehydrogenase enzymes. Epicardial applications of bradykinin (5 micrograms) and nicotine (50 micrograms) were used to stimulate chemically sensitive sympathetic and vagal afferent nerve endings, respectively. Twenty-nine dogs were studied before and 90 min after creation of transmural myocardial infarction. In 20 dogs, epicardial bradykinin applied before production of transmural myocardial infarction produced a maximal pressor response of 13 +/- 3 mm Hg 40 sec after application (p less than .01 vs preapplication values), while topical nicotine produced a maximal depressor response of 14 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than .01 vs preapplication values) 20 sec after application at all sites tested. Ninety minutes after production of transmural myocardial infarction, epicardial sites basal to the infarction continued to respond normally to both drugs, while sites within the area of infarction and apical to the area (noninfarcted myocardium) no longer showed a pressor response to topical bradykinin or a depressor response to topical nicotine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

However, evidence indicates that the neurogenic control of the heart spans from the maintenance of housekeeping functions in resting conditions to the recruitment of maximal performance, in the fight-or-flight responses, across a whole range of intermediate states. To perform such sophisticated functions, sympathetic ganglia integrate both peripheral and central inputs, and transmit information to the heart via 'motor' neurons, directly interacting with target cardiomyocytes.

Her research focuses on the role of cardiac sympathetic innervation in the regulation of cardiomyocyte structure through modulation of intracellular proteostasis. She has discovered how cardiac sympathetic innervation regulates cardiac mass, and identified how alterations in cardiac proteostasis lead to cardiomyopathy. Her research uses in vitro and in vivo models, with various techniques from cellular biochemistry and signalling, to organ physiology. To train her cardiac sympathetic neurons, she works out at the gym. Marco Mongillo, MD, PhD, coordinates the Molecular Cardiology lab at the VIMM, and his main research interests are centred on the intercellular communication of sympathetic neurons with their myocardial cellular targets.

abstract = {To determine the time course of afferent sympathetic and vagal denervation after coronary occlusion and that of neural recovery after reperfusion, we measured the vasopressor responses to bradykinin and the vasodepressor responses to nicotine applied in a felt pad to the left ventricular epicardium of open-chest dogs. Shortly after latex injection of a diagonal branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), the vasopressor response to bradykinin applied to the transmural ischemic area (n = 7) or apically to it (n = 6) was interrupted or attenuated. In contrast, nontransmural ischemia produced by ligation of the diagonal branch did not attenuate the response to bradykinin applied to the ischemic region (n = 6) or apically to it (n = 7). Transmural ischemia produced by occlusion of a diagonal branch of the LAD and a lateral marginal branch of the left circumflex coronary artery (n = 8) or by intraluminal balloon occlusion of the LAD (n = 7) decreased the vasopressor response to bradykinin applied within or apically to the ischemic area in {\textless} 13 min. The vasopressor response to bradykinin became attenuated when the myocardial blood flow in the epicardial test site decreased to {\~{}} 40{\%} or less of the control value. Nontransmural ischemia produced by occlusion of a diagonal branch (n = 7) attenuated the vasodepressor response to nicotine applied to the nonischemic area apically to the occlusion in {\textless} 13 min. A 15-min coronary occlusion followed by reperfusion produced reversible attenuation of afferent neural responses. We conclude that ischemia interrupts afferent sympathetic and vagal cardiac reflex responses to bradykinin and nicotine and that these alterations are reversible after reperfusion.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors. Modulation of human cardiac mechanical and electrophysiologic function by direct s tellate ganglion stimulation has not been performed. Our aim was to assess the effect of low-level left stellate ganglion (LSG) stimulation (SGS) on arrhythmias, hemodynamic, and cardiac electrophysiological indices. Patients undergoing ablation procedures for arrhythmias were recruited for SGS. A stimulating electrode was placed next to the LSG under fluoroscopy and ultrasound imaging; and SGS (5–10 Hz, 10–20 mA) was performed. We measured hemodynamic, intracardiac and ECG parameters, and activation recovery intervals (ARIs) (surrogate for action potential duration) from a duodecapolar catheter in the right ventricular outflow tract. Five patients underwent SGS (3 males, 45 ± 20 years). Stimulating catheter placement was successful, and without complication in all patients. SGS did not change heart rate, but increased mean arterial blood pressure (78 ± 3 mmHg to 98 ± 5 mmHg, P {\textless} 0.001) and dP/dt max (1148 ± 244 mmHg/sec to 1645 ± 493 mmHg/sec, P = 0.03). SGS shortened mean ARI from 304 ± 23 msec to 283 ± 17 msec (P {\textless} 0.001), although one patient required parasympathetic blockade. Dispersion of repolarization (DOR) increased in four patients and decreased in one, consistent with animal models. QT interval, T-wave duration and amplitude at baseline and with SGS were 415 ± 15 msec versus 399 ± 15 msec (P {\textless} 0.001); 201 ± 12 msec versus 230 ± 28 msec; and 0.2 ± 0.09 mV versus 0.22 ± 0.08 mV, respectively. At the level of SGS performed, no increase in arrhythmias was seen. Percutaneous low-level SGS shortens ARI in the RVOT, and increases blood pressure and LV contractility. These observations demonstrate feasibility of percutaneous SGS in humans.},

abstract = {AIMS: Increased cardiac sympathetic neuron (SN) activity has been associated with pathologies such as heart failure and hypertrophy, suggesting that cardiac innervation regulates cardiomyocyte trophism. Whether continuous input from the SNs is required for the maintenance of the cardiomyocyte size has not been determined thus far.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: To address the role of cardiac innervation in cardiomyocyte size regulation, we monitored the effect of pharmacological sympathetic denervation in mice on cardiac structure, function, and signalling from 24 h to 30 days in the absence of other pathological stimuli. SN ablation caused an immediate reduction in the cardiomyocyte size with minimal consequences on the resting contractile function. Atrophic remodelling was mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system through FOXO-dependent early induction of the muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases Atrogin-1/MAFbx and MuRF1, which was followed by activation of the autophagy-lysosome system. MuRF1 was found to be determinant in denervation atrophy as remodelling did not develop in denervated MuRF1 knock-out (KO) hearts. These effects were caused by decreased basal stimulation of cardiomyocyte $\beta$2-adrenoceptor (AR), as atrophy was prevented by treatment of denervated mice with the $\beta$2-AR agonist clenbuterol. Consistent with these data, we also observed that $\beta$2-AR KO mice showed cardiac atrophy at rest.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Cardiac SNs are strong regulators of the cardiomyocyte size via $\beta$2-AR-dependent repression of proteolysis, demonstrating that the neuro-cardiac axis operates constitutively for the determination of the physiological cardiomyocyte size. These results are of great clinical relevance given the role of $\beta$-AR in cardiovascular diseases and their modulation in therapy.},

Forty‐eight patients with ASA physical status 1 and 2 and without cardiovascular disease were included in the study. Thirty‐six patients scheduled for elective upper abdominal surgery were randomly assigned to Group 1 (TEA, bupivacaine 0.25{\%}, n= 12), Group 2 (TEA, bupivacaine 0.5{\%}, n = 12) or to Group 3 (control without TEA, n= 12). TEA induced a sensory block which extended over all cardiac segments. In order to assess the effect of systemically absorbed bupivacaine, we studied a separate group of patients who received lumbar epidural anesthesia without involvement of the cardiac segments: Group 4 (LEA, bupivacaine 0.5{\%}, n= 10). Left ventricular contractility was assessed using the end‐systolic pressure‐length relationship. Left ventricular dimensions were measured by transesophageal echocardiography. All hemodynamic measurements were performed under general anesthesia. There was no significant difference in systolic or diastolic arterial pressure, heart rate, left ventricular end‐systolic and end‐diastolic cross‐sectional areas and left ventricular wall stress between the four groups. Left ventricular maximum elastance as a measure of left ventricular contractility was significantly (P{\textless}0.001) reduced in Groups 1 and 2 [8.1 (±3.5) and 9.6 (±4.4) kPa {\textperiodcentered} cm‐1, respectively] as compared to Groups 3 and 4 [18.4 (±8.8) and 17.7 (±7.7) kPa {\textperiodcentered} cm‐1, respectively]. No significant difference could be demonstrated between Groups 1 and 2 or between Groups 3 and 4.

The distribution of monoaminergic terminals in the arterial wall depends on the diameter of the artery. In large arteries, the terminals are regularly distributed around the entire circumference, the fibres being situated between the elastic lamellae of the adventitia. The terminals within the media could not be detected. In small arteries, the sympathetic ground plexus aggregates in two parallel strands, the artery being between them. In arterioles, two thick fibres only accompany the vellel. The myocardium is innervated by means of a three-dimensional sympathetic ground plexus distributed between the myocardial cells independently of vessels. No difference in density of innervation was found between the right and left heart. The point-counting method, on the other hand, has revealed that the density of innervation in the left auricle is nearly twice as dense as in the left ventricle. The terminals innervating the myocardium are markedly thinner than the fibres innervating the arteries. Two-dimensional plexuses innervate the epicardium, endocardium and valves.},

abstract = {Aims ST-elevation myocardial infarction is associated with high levels of cardiac sympathetic drive and release of the cotransmitter neuropeptide Y (NPY). We hypothesized that despite beta-blockade, NPY promotes arrhythmogenesis via ventricular myocyte receptors. Methods In 78 patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention, sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or and results fibrillation (VF) occurred in 6 (7.7{\%}) within 48 h. These patients had significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) higher venous NPY levels despite the absence of classical risk factors including late presentation, larger infarct size, and beta-blocker usage. Receiver operating curve identified an NPY threshold of 27.3 pg/mL with a sensitivity of 0.83 and a specificity of 0.71. RT-qPCR demonstrated the presence of NPY mRNA in both human and rat stellate ganglia. In the isolated Langendorff perfused rat heart, prolonged (10 Hz, 2 min) stimulation of the stellate ganglia caused significant NPY release. Despite maximal beta-blockade with metoprolol (10 lmol/L), optical mapping of ventricular voltage and calcium (using RH237 and Rhod2) demonstrated an increase in magnitude and shortening in duration of the calcium transient and a significant lowering of ventricular fibrillation threshold. These effects were prevented by the Y1 receptor antagonist BIBO3304 (1 lmol/L). Neuropeptide Y (250 nmol/L) significantly increased the incidence of VT/VF (60{\%} vs. 10{\%}) during experimental ST-elevation ischaemia and reperfusion compared to control, and this could also be prevented by BIBO3304. Conclusions The co-transmitter NPY is released during sympathetic stimulation and acts as a novel arrhythmic trigger. Drugs inhibiting the Y1 receptor work synergistically with beta-blockade as a new anti-arrhythmic therapy.},

Complex, nonencapsulated nerve endings discharging into myelinated afferents have been known to exist for many years. More recently, however, indirect evidence for the existence of cardiac receptors that are either silent or exhibit low resting rates of activity, and discharge into slowly conducting C-type fibers, has been demonstrated. The receptors themselves have not yet been identified histologically. Cardiac receptors include subpopulations that are preferenthlly activated by chemical stimuli, including a variety of exogenous chemicals as well as prostaglandins. Another subpopulation is preferentially activated by mechanical stresses in the physiological range. Further investigation may reveal their participation in overall cardiovascular regulation, and mediation of responses to exogenous chemical stimuli. Four principal cardiac sympathetic nerves have been identified in the right thoracic region and three on the left. Most carry sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers. Stimulation of individual nerves, before and after parasympathetic blockade, results in regionally, well-defined myocardial responses.},

abstract = {Background Cardiac autonomic perturbations frequently antecede onset of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). Interventions that influence autonomic inputs to myocardium may prevent AF. However, whether low heart rate or heart rate variability (HRV), which are noninvasive measures of cardiac autonomic dysfunction, are associated with AF incidence is unclear. Objectives This study sought to study the association between HRV and risk of AF. Methods This study included 11,715 middle-aged adults in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities) cohort with heart rate and HRV measures obtained from 2-min electrocardiogram recordings performed at baseline (1987 to 1989). These measures included SD of normal-to-normal RR intervals, high-frequency (HF) (0.15 to 0.40 Hz), low-frequency (0.04 to 0.15 Hz), and the low-frequency/HF ratio (denoting a greater sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance). Incident AF cases were ascertained by electrocardiogram at ARIC follow-up visits, hospital discharge diagnosis, or death certificates through 2011. Results During an average follow-up of 19.4 years, 1,580 or 13.5{\%} of participants developed AF. A baseline heart rate {\textless}60 beats/min was associated modestly with an increased risk of AF. Lower overall HRV as well as increased sympathetic/parasympathetic tone were associated independently with a higher risk of AF; the hazard ratio for each 1 SD lower SD of normal-to-normal RR intervals was 1.14 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.08 to 1.21), for HF was 1.12 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.06 to 1.17), and for low frequency/HF was 1.08 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.03 to 1.14). Conclusions Cardiac autonomic dysfunction denoted by low resting short-term HRV was associated with higher AF incidence. A low heart rate may be associated with higher AF risk. Further studies are needed to determine whether interventions in the general population to restore autonomic balance may prevent AF.},

Mechanistic links between the brain and the heart have been explored in detail over the past several decades, and catecholamine excess, neuroendocrine dysfunction, and unchecked inflammation all likely contribute to the pathophysiologic process. Although cardiac dysfunction has also been described in other disease paradigms, including septic shock and thermal injury, there is likely a common underlying pathophysiology. In this review, we will examine the pathophysiology of cardiac dysfunction after neurologic injury, discuss the evidence surrounding cardiac dysfunction after different neurologic injuries, and suggest future research goals to gain knowledge and improve outcomes in this patient population.},

abstract = {ROS Load-free in solution Expansion Contraction Ca 2+ ROS Mechanical load Expansion Contraction Ca 2+ NO Abstract The heart has the ability to adjust to changing mechanical loads. The Frank–Starling law and the Anrep effect describe exquisite intrinsic mechanisms the heart has for autoregulating the force of contraction to maintain cardiac output under changes of preload and afterload. Although these mechanisms have been known for more than a century, their cellular and molecular underpinnings are still debated. How does the cardiac myocyte sense changes in preload or afterload? How does the myocyte adjust its response to compensate for such changes? In cardiac myocytes Ca 2+ is a crucial regulator of contractile force and in this review we compare and contrast recent studies from different labs that address these two important questions. The 'dimensionality' of the mechanical milieu under which experiments are carried out provide important clues to the location of the mechanosensors and the kinds of mechanical forces they can sense and respond to. As a first approximation, sensors inside the myocyte appear to modulate reactive oxygen species while sensors on the cell surface appear to also modulate nitric oxide signalling; both signalling pathways affect Ca 2+ handling. Undoubtedly, further studies will add layers to this simplified picture. Clarifying the intimate links from cellular mechanics to reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide signalling and to Ca 2+ handling will deepen our understanding of the Frank–Starling law and the Anrep effect, and also provide a unified view on how arrhythmias may arise in seemingly disparate diseases that have in common altered myocyte mechanics. Ye Chen-Izu and Leighton T. Izu collaborate in an interdisciplinary team to combine experiments with mathematical modeling for in-depth analyses of the interaction of three dynamics systems – electrical, Ca 2+ signaling, and mechanical systems – that govern cardiac function and heart diseases. Abstract figure legend Surface and internal mechanosensors link to NO and ROS signalling and to Ca 2+ handling. Surface (blue) and internal (red and green) mechanosensors are depicted as springs. In experimental systems where the myocyte is in bathing solution that offers little mechanical resistance, the surface mechanosensors experience little or no strain (change in length divided by original length) as shown in the left panel. The internal mechanosensors experience strain and can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that affect Ca 2+ handling. In other experimental systems the myocyte is adherent to a stretchable membrane or encased in a viscoelastic gel that provides mechanical resistance as the cell contracts or stretches; this mechanical loading causes surface mechanosensor strain as shown in the right panel. In these systems both internal and surface mechanosensors are activated. We and others have shown that this can result in activation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and production of nitric oxide (NO), which affects Ca},

abstract = {Most deaths in the first 30 days after cardiac transplantation are due to failure of the donor heart, often with the clinical picture of right ventricular failure. Indeed, there is a significant reduction in contractility of the human donor heart and loss of contractile reserve before and soon after transplantation. This myocardial insult appears in association with brain death in the donor and follows a "catecholamine storm" associated with a rapidly rising intracranial pressure. Microscopy of the myocardium in organ donors shows a picture typical of catecholamine-induced injury and similar to changes found in endomyocardial specimens of stress cardiomyopathy (catecholamineinduced cardiomyopathy, or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy). There are 3 common features between stress cardiomyopathy and the heart of a brain-dead donor: exposure of the heart to unusually high catecholamine levels, ventricular dysfunction, and prompt recovery. Stress cardiomyopathy is a temporary myocardial dysfunction that has been described after sub-arachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic head injury, pheochromocytoma, acute emotional distress, exogenous administration of catecholamines, and non-related surgery. Given the common features of this catecholamine-mediated myocardial insult, we ask if brain-dead donor heart dysfunction is an extreme variant of stress cardiomyopathy? And, if so is it, like stress cardiomyopathy, reversible? Can we therefore expect recovery of the dysfunctional donor heart over time, thereby permitting increased use of hearts offered for transplantation? {\textcopyright} 2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Autonomic control of the heart has a significant influence over development of life threatening arrhythmias that can lead to sudden cardiac death. Sympathetic activity is known to be upregulated during these conditions and hence the sympathetic nerves present a target for treatment. However, a better understanding of the anatomy and physiology of cardiac sympathetic nerves is required for the progression of clinical interventions. This review explores the organization of the cardiac sympathetic nerves, from the preganglionic origin to the postganglionic innervations, and provides an overview of literature surrounding anti-arrhythmic therapies including thoracic sympathectomy and dorsal spinal cord stimulation. Several features of the innervation are clear. The cardiac nerves differentially supply the nodal and myocardial tissue of the heart and are dependent on activity generated in spinal neurones in the upper thoracic cord which project to synapse with ganglion cells in the stellate complex on each side. Networks of spinal interneurones determine the pattern of activity. Groups of spinal neurones selectively target specific regions of the heart but whether they exhibit a functional selectivity has still to be elucidated. Electrical or ischemic signals can lead to remodeling of nerves in the heart or ganglia. Surgical and electrical methods are proving to be clinically beneficial in reducing atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure and severe cardiac pain. This is a rapidly developing area and we need more basic understanding of how these methods work to ensure safety and reduction of side effects.},

We examined whether adenosine acts via a specific receptor mechanism to produce neural stunning. Anesthetized dogs were treated with propranolol to attenuate increases in coronary flow due to adrenergic stimulation of myocardial metabolism. A 15-min occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) attenuated subsequent LAD coronary vasoconstriction to bilateral sympathetic stimulation during reperfusion by 75{\%} (P {\textless} 0.05). Coronary infusion of the adenosine-receptor antagonist 8-p-sulfophenyltheophylline (nonspecific), 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (A1 specific), or 3,7-dimethyl-1-propagylxanthine (A2 specific) during LAD occlusion prevented the attenuation of sympathetic coronary constriction. In separate experiments, either the specific adenosine agonist N6-cyclopentyl-adenosine (A1 specific) or CGS-21680 (A2 specific) or a combination of both agonists was infused into the LAD for 15 min. Neither agonist alone attenuated subsequent sympathetic coronary constriction. In contrast, 15 min after the combined administration of both agonists, sympathetic vasoconstriction was reduced. We conclude that adenosine is capable of attenuating neurogenic coronary constriction through a receptor-mediated mechanism. Activation of more than one receptor subtype is necessary to produce neural stunning.},

abstract = {ÐThis review focuses on that most engaging feature of the sympathetic nervous system, its rhythmicity. In particular examining the nature of sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), its characteristics, the frequencies of these rhythms and possible mechanisms responsible for their generation. Sympathetic activity can be thought of as a complex output of the central nervous system providing subtle control over end organ function. This control is exerted in a number of frequency bands including rhythms related to the cardiac and respiratory cycles, 10 Hz, and between 0.2 and 0.4 Hz. The generation and control over the occurrence of each of these rhythms is likely to be quite separate. Although aerent feedback from sources such as baroreceptors can explain some of the rhythmical properties in each case there is good evidence for inherent generation of aspects of these rhythms. A variety of brainstem cell groups are thought to be involved in their generation with the rostral ventrolateral medulla, although unlikely to be solely responsible for tone generation, an important regulator of overall activity. SNA also varies in the number of nerves recruited to {\textregistered}re in each synchronized discharge. Little is known about this control other than it appears to be quite separate from the control over the timing of discharges. Spinal cord mechanisms are possibly involved. SNA frequencies above 0.7 Hz do not appear to directly induce oscillations in innervated vasculature, however, are likely to contribute to setting the level of vasoconstrictive tone. Slower frequencies appear to directly cause oscillations in blood ¯ow. {\#}},

Injection of nicotine or veratridine into the Cx consistently resulted in larger decreases in heart rate, arterial pressure, and in gracilis perfusion pressure than were observed following injection of the same dose into the LAD. Vagotomy abolished the cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor responses to intracoronary nicotine or veratridine. The weight of left ventricle perfused by LAD or Cx was not different (43.5 ± 1.65 and 44.5 ± 2.2 g, respectively). Resting coronary blood flow in LAD and Cx was 55.0 ± 1.7 and 59.4 ± 1 ml/min, respectively. These data indicate that chemical activation of sensory endings with vagal afferents in the inferoposterior left ventricle of the dog results in larger cardioinhibitor and vasodepressor responses than result from activation of receptors in the anterior left ventricle. Further, these data provide strong evidence that these sensory endings which are chemically activated are preferentially distributed to the inferoposterior left ventricle.},

abstract = {The role of pressor sympathetic reflexes in circulatory control was investigated in conscious dogs. Animals were previously instrumented with a 6- to 8-cm rigid core cannula covered by an inflatable rubber cylinder in the thoracic aorta, a pressure catheter implanted in the aorta above the cannula, and a second catheter inserted into the aorta below the cannula through a femoral artery. Two piezoelectric crystals were positioned at opposing adventitial sites to measure aortic distension with ultrasound techniques. After recovery from surgery, the diameter of the aortic segment surrounding the cannula was increased by 9.6 +/- 0.4{\%} from 16 +/- 1 mm by inflating the rubber cylinder, without obstructing blood flow. Mean aortic pressure rose 31 +/- 3{\%} from 100 +/- 3 mm Hg and heart rate 20 +/- 3{\%} from 91 +/- 3 beats/min (P less than 0.01). The pressor response was abolished by alpha-adrenergic blockade (phentolamine 1 mg/kg, iv). The heart rate response was reduced either by beta-blockade (propranolol 1 mg/kg, iv) or muscarinic blockade (atropine 0.2 mg/kg, iv) and abolished by their combination. During aortic stretch, the sensitivity of the baroreflex was reduced 57 +/- 7{\%} from 18 +/- 2 msec/mm Hg (P less than 0.01). The pressor response was increased by 49 +/- 8{\%} after bilateral carotid sinus nerve section and vagotomy. These excitatory reflex responses were obtained in absence of any pain reaction. Thus, in the conscious dog, aortic distension within physiological ranges induces a potent pressor sympathetic reflex with positive feedback characteristics. Such a pressor reflex not only occurs in the presence of functioning baroreflexes, but is also capable of reducing their sensitivity.},

In eight dogs with latex-induced TMI, bilateral ansae subclaviae stimulation shortened ERP at all 45 apical and basal test sites before latex injection. After latex injection, ERP shortening was unchanged at all 15 basal sites but was eliminated (less than or equal to 2 msec shortening) at three apical sites in 5-20 minutes and at 14 of 30 apical sites 30-180 minutes after latex injection. At the remaining 13 apical sites, ERP shortening was not eliminated but attenuated significantly in 5-180 minutes. ERP shortening induced by infused norepinephrine (0.20-0.25 microgram/kg/min) did not differ between basal and apical test sites 3-4 hours after latex injection; that is, no supersensitivity occurred. Of six dogs with TMI produced by ligation of multiple coronary arteries without latex injection, ERP shortening induced by efferent sympathetic neural stimulation was eliminated at 10 apical sites in four dogs over a period of 3 hours. At 14 apical sites that did not show denervation in these six dogs, ERP shortening was unchanged. In seven dogs with latex-induced TMI, bilateral vagal stimulation lengthened ERP at all 40 apical and basal test sites before latex injection. Vagally induced ERP lengthening was unchanged at all 13 basal sites after latex injection. ERP lengthening was eliminated (less than or equal to 1 msec lengthening) at four of 27 apical sites in 5-20 minutes and at 13 apical sites 30-180 minutes after latex injection. At the remaining 10 apical sites, ERP lengthening was not eliminated but decreased significantly 3 hours after latex injection. Of nine dogs with ligation-induced NTMI, five dogs showed elimination of vagally induced ERP lengthening at eight apical sites in 3 hours after ligation. ERP lengthening induced by vagal stimulation was unchanged at all 17 basal sites in nine dogs with NTMI. We conclude that TMI produced by latex injection and ligation of multiple coronary arteries produces heterogeneous loss of efferent sympathetic innervation in noninfarcted apical sites as early as 5-20 minutes after coronary occlusion with more complete denervation occurring over time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

We will emphasize the relationship between attentional regulation and affective processes and propose a group of underlying physiological systems that serve to integrate these functions in the service of self-regulation and adaptability of the organism. We will attempt to place this network in the context of dynamical systems models which involve feedback and feedforward circuits with special attention to negative feedback mechanisms, inhibitory processes, and their role in response selection. From a systems perspective, inhibitory processes can be viewed as negative feedback circuits that allow for the interruption of ongoing behavior and the re-deployment of resources to other tasks. When these negative feedback mechanisms are compromised, positive feedback loops may develop as a result (of dis-inhibition). From this perspective, the relative sympathetic activation seen in anxiety disorders may represent dis-inhibition due to faulty inhibitory mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine if autonomic nerve interventions exerted quantitatively dissimilar effects on recovery properties of endocardium compared with epicardium. Effective refractory periods (ERP) were measured by the extrastimulus technique in the endocardium and epicardium of the canine left ventricular anterior wall. The basic train and premature stimuli were administered to the endocardium and overlying epicardium via different poles on the same multipolar needle electrode, using cathodal stimuli. Sympathetic augmentation produced via bilateral carotid arterial occlusion or electrical stimulation of right, left, and both sympathetic nerves shortened ERP. Bilateral sympathetic denervation prolonged ERP. The canges in ERP of the endocardium were no different than were changes in the ERP of overlying epicardium. In separate studies, electrical stimulation of the cervical vagi prolonged ERP similarly in epicardium and endocardium. Pacing at slower rates or physostigmine administration potentiated the ERP prolongation in endocardium similar to epicardium. Augmented sympathetic tone produced by carotid occlusion also potentiated prolongation of ERP by vagal stimulation. The percent change in endocardial sites was slightly but significantly less than in epicardial sites. ERP prolongation due to vagal stimulation was attenuated markedly after sympathectomy and abolished with both propranolol and atropine. We conclude that, in the normal anterior left ventricular myocardium of the dog, sympathetic augmentation shortens ERP in epicardial sites equivalent to that in the underlying endocardial sites, that vagal nerve stimulation prolongs ERP in epicardial sites equal to or slightly greater than in the underlying endocardial sites, and that vagal stimulation antagonizes background sympathetic activity.},

abstract = {Background: Atrial ectopic discharges originating in the pulmonary veins (PVs) are known to initiate atrial fibrillation (AF), which may be terminated by catheter-based PV isolation. Because a functional relationship exists between cardiac autonomic effects and PVs in arrhythmogenesis, it has been suggested that discharges of the nerves that proceed to the PVs and interconnect with intrinsic ganglionated nerve plexuses are potential triggers of AF in man. Objective: This study sought to determine the characteristics and distribution of neural routes by which autonomic nerves supply the human PVs. Methods: We examined the intrinsic neural structures of 35 intact (nonsectioned) left atrial (LA)-PV complexes stained transmurally for acetylcholinesterase using a stereomicroscope. Results: The epicardial ganglionated nerves pass onto the extrapulmonary segments of the human PVs from the middle, left dorsal, and dorsal right atrial subplexuses. The left and right inferior PVs involved a lesser number of ganglia than the left and right superior PVs. Abundant extensions of epicardial nerves penetrate transmurally the PV walls and form a patchy neural network beneath the endothelium of PVs. The subendothelial neural meshwork with numerous free nerve endings, which appeared to be typical sensory compact nerve endings, was mostly situated at the roots of the 4 PVs. No ganglia were identified beneath the endothelium of the human PVs. Conclusion: The richest areas containing epicardial ganglia, from which intrinsic nerves extend to the human PVs, are concentrated at the inferior surface of both the inferior and left superior PVs. Therefore, these locations might be considered as potential targets for focal pulmonary vein ablation in catheter-based therapy of AF. {\textcopyright} 2009 Heart Rhythm Society.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prior experimental studies show that thoracic spinal cord stimulation (SCS) improves left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF). The mechanism of this improvement in the LV contractile function after SCS and its effects on the myocardial oxygen consumption remains unknown.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We performed thoracic SCS (T1-T2 level) followed by 4 weeks of rapid ventricular pacing in 9 adult pigs with ischemic heart failure (HF) induced by myocardial infarction (MI). At 24 hours off-pacing, detailed echocardiogram and invasive hemodynamic assessment were performed to determine LV contractile function and myocardial oxygen consumption. Serum norepinephrine level was measured before and after SCS. SCS was performed on 2 occasions for 15 minutes, 30 minutes apart (recovery) with 50 Hz frequency (pulse width 0.2 millisecond, 90{\%} of motor threshold at 2 Hz output). Echocardiogram revealed significant decrease in LVEF (33.8 ± 1.8{\%} vs 66.5 ± 1.7{\%}, P {\textless} 0.01) after induction of MI and HF. Compared with MI and HF, acute SCS significantly increased LVEF and +dP/dt (all P {\textless} 0.05). Withdrawal of SCS during recovery decreased +dP/dt, but not LVEF that increased again with repeated SCS. Myocardial oxygen consumption also significantly decreased during SCS compared with MI and HF (P = 0.006) without any change in serum norepinephrine level (P = 0.9). Speckle tracking imaging showed significant improvement in global and regional circumferential strains over the infarcted mid and apical regions, decreased in time to peak circumferential strain over the lateral and posterior wall after SCS, and the degree of intraventricular dyssynchrony during SCS compared with MI and HF (P {\textless} 0.05).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In a porcine model of ischemic HF, acute SCS improved global and regional LV contractile function and intraventricular dyssynchrony, and decreased myocardial oxygen consumption without elevation of norepinephrine level.},

abstract = {The autonomic nervous system plays an integral role in the modulation of normal cardiac electrophysiology. This is achieved via a complex network of pre- and postganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers that synapse on extrinsic and intrinsic cardiac ganglia and ultimately directly innervate cardiac myocytes. Alterations in autonomic tone may induce changes in local cellular electrophysiology that may manifest clinically in a number of ways, ranging from changes in heart rate to changes in heart rhythm. These relationships between autonomic tone and the evolution of cardiac dysrhythmias are areas of evolving research, with increasing evidence for a key role for autonomic ganglia in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation and sympathetic nerves in the predilection toward ventricular tachycardia in areas of myocardial scar. In this review, we highlight what is known about the anatomy and physiology of the cardiac autonomic nervous system, the evidence supporting the relationship of autonomic tone to clinically significant arrhythmias, and a variety of mechanisms (eg, direct ion channel effects) and diagnostic tools that exist to help define this relationship. Further emphasized are potential future avenues of research needed to elucidate the relationship between changes in normal autonomic tone and the pathogenesis of cardiac arrhythmias.},

abstract = {The effect of psychologic stress on cardiac vulnerability was examined in 10 conscious dogs. The repetitive extrasystole threshold wasemployed as a measure of susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation. Instrumental aversive conditioning constituted a stressful environment. The repetitive extrasystole threshold decreased by nearly 50 percent during 3 days in which the animals were exposed to the stressful environment. When Tolamolol hydrochloride, a cardioselective beta adrenoceptor blocking agent, was administered before a stress session, the repetitive extra-systole threshold was unaltered from the control value. Thus, stress-evoked changes in cardiac vulnerabilityare mediated through the sympathetic nervous system. The role of psychologic stress in predisposing to cardiac arrhythmias is well recognized clinically. However, precise data documenting this relation have been difficult to obtain in man or in the animal laboratory. With growing interest in the problem of sudden death due to ventricular fibrillation, attention has been devoted to alterations in ventricular vulnerability during various stressful states. Recently it has been demonstrated in dogs that the threshold of the ventricular vulnerable period for eliciting repetitive extrasystoles is significantly lower in an aversive than in a placid environment. 1 It has also been found that animals placed in stressful restraint after myocardial infarction experience ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia. 2 In pigs protected against psychologic stress, the onset of ventricular fibrillation after coronary arterial ligation is either retarded or entirely prevented, u Moreover, pharmacologically restrained pigs subjected to electrical stimulation undergo severe acute cardiomyopathy and 13 percent die suddenly. 4 This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of psychologic stress upon ventricular electrical stability in the conscious dog. The assumption entertained was that a change in cardiac electrical stability was associated with increased susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation. 5 The underlying hypothesis was that a psychologically stressful environment would increase cardiac electrical instability. Instrumental aversive conditioning was the experimental paradigm employed to produce psychologic stress. 6-s Since certain types of stressors in man affect cardiac function through sympathetic nervous mediation, 9 these studies were performed with and without blockade of beta adrenergic activity. Cardiac electrical stability was determined by measuring the threshold current necessary to provoke repetitive ventricular extrasystoles. It has been demonstrated that the repetitive extrasystole threshold can be used as a precise measure of the vulnerable period threshold for ventricular fibrillation.I, lo Methods Ten mongrel dogs, weighing 8.5 to 17 kg, were anesthetized with intravenously administered sodium pentobarbital, 32.5 mg/kg body weight.
