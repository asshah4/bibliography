abstract = {Viscosity (eta) in a blood suspension is affected by the total hematocrit (HT) as well as by the deformability of the cells. The impact of these combined factors on the rheologic behavior of sickle cell suspensions and on guidelines for transfusion has not been explored fully. Therefore, the eta of mixtures of washed normal (AA) and sickle (SS) red cells was determined in a rotational viscosimeter as a function of the hematocrit level of SS cells (HS), HT, oxygen tension (PO2), and shear rate. The ratio HT:eta can be taken as an index of potential oxygen delivery. The optimal HT (for maximum HT:eta) became progressively higher as the HS or the HS:HT ratio was lowered: at a given HT, HT:eta rose with a decrease in HS, especially at low HS values. These data support the concept that simple transfusion alone is not as beneficial to the patient as exchange transfusion and that substantial benefit can be obtained by bringing the patient to very low HS levels. The finding that eta rose with HT more steeply when the HS:HT ratio rather than HS was held constant suggested that the absolute level of HS may be more useful than the HS:HT ratio as a guide for a transfusion regimen.},

The patient presented with bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy that was shown to be moderately to markedly FDG-avid on a whole body PET/CT scan. Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells detected identical T cell population with aberrant immunophenotype. Additionally, a TCR beta gene was found to be clonally rearranged in both peripheral blood and bone marrow supporting a clonal origin of atypical T cells. However, no such clonal population of T-cells could be detected in a pathologic specimen obtained from an excisional biopsy of one of the patients cervical lymph nodes. After discontinuing the patients phenytoin, his lymphadenopathy has nearly completely resolved and circulation clonal T cell population disappeared with 12 months of follow-up.},

abstract = {Importance Biochemical markers of disease allow clinicians to monitor disease severity, progression, and response to treatment. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are commonly used biochemical markers of inflammatory disease. We present 2 cases that indicate that D-dimer levels may be useful as a potential biochemical marker of disease activity in certain cutaneous inflammatory conditions. Observations We report 2 cases in which clinical disease activity correlates with D-dimer levels. The first case is a woman in her 50s with a diagnosis of cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa. The second case is a man in his 20s with recurrent urticaria. In both patients, plasma D-dimer levels increased with clinical evidence of disease activity and decreased with treatment and resolution of the disease flare. Interestingly, serum C-reactive protein levels did not correlate with disease activity and were found to be normal during clinically active disease. Conclusions and Relevance We show the potential value of D-dimer measurements as a marker of vasculocentric and/or vasculopathic inflammation and suggest that vascular endothelial damage may be ongoing in certain cutaneous inflammatory conditions.},

@article{Marouf2011,
abstract = {Sickle cell anemia is an inherited disease that causes chronic hemolytic anemia. Its pathognomonic signs and symptoms are caused by hemoglobin (Hb) S, which results from a single nucleotide substitution in the $\beta$-globin gene that places the amino acid valine with glutamic acid at codon 6 of the $\beta$-globin chain. Hb S is an insoluble Hb that crystalizes at low oxygen tension and other precipitating conditions leading to rigidity of red cells and clumping in small blood vessels. Patients with sickle cell disease have a variable Hb level that may range from 7.0 to 11.0 g/dL in their steady state condition. The most common cause of hospital presentation is due to acute painful crisis that results from vaso-occlusion by sickled cells. These episodes are treated with hydration and analgesia and do not require blood transfusion. Blood transfusion should be aimed to increase tissue delivery of oxygen. Hb S is known to be a low affinity Hb and so delivers oxygen at a lower partial pressure of oxygen compared to Hb A. Even with adequate pre transfusion testing and precautions, blood transfusion is never totally safe and short or long term complications may occur. Blood transfusion in patients with sickle cell disease has only limited indications such as acute hemolytic, aplastic or sequestration crises. Chronic transfusion protocols are implemented in cases of strokes or high cerebral blood flow ultrasonic studies as a prophylactic measure. Exchange blood transfusion is used in some complications of the disease such as acute chest syndrome (ACS), priapism or peri operatively. Once it is decided to transfuse blood, the transfused blood should be Hb S negative, Rh and Kell antigen matched.},

abstract = {Background: D-dimer is produced during the fibrinolysis. A retrospective study was conducted to assess the association between D-dimer and inflammatory parameters in unselected patients with digestive diseases. Methods: All patients who were consecutively admitted to our department between January 2016 and October 2016 and underwent D-dimer tests were included. Spearman non-parametric tests and Pearson chi-square tests were performed to evaluate the correlation of D-dimer with inflammatory parameters. The correlation coefficients were calculated. Results: Overall, 205 patients (112 males and 93 females) underwent 245 D-dimer tests. Among them, 9 patients were diagnosed with pancreatitis (8 males and 1 female) and 14 patients with liver cirrhosis (6 males and 8 females). In the overall analysis, D-dimer positively correlated with white blood cell (WBC), percentage of neutrophils, neutrophil count, C reaction protein, high sensitive C reaction protein (hsCRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and blood culture detection, but negatively correlated with lymphocyte percentage and lymphocyte count. In the subgroup analysis of patients with pancreatitis, D-dimer positively correlated with hsCRP and PCT. In the subgroup analysis of patients with liver cirrhosis, D-dimer positively correlated with WBC and hsCRP. Conclusions: D-dimer may reflect the inflammation conditions in unselected patients with digestive diseases. Further validation study should focus on the patients with specific digestive diseases.},

abstract = {Background. Preoperative transfusions are frequently given to prevent perioperative morbidity in pa- tients with sickle cell anemia. There is no consensus, how- ever, on the best regimen of transfusions for this purpose. Methods. We conducted a multicenter study to com- pare the rates of perioperative complications among pa- tients randomly assigned to receive either an aggressive transfusion regimen designed to decrease the hemoglo- bin S level to less than 30 percent (group 1) or a conser- vative regimen designed to increase the hemoglobin level to 10 g per deciliter (group 2). Results. Patients undergoing a total of 604 operations were randomly assigned to group 1 or group 2. The se- verity of the disease, compliance with the protocol, and the types of operations were similar in the two groups. The preoperative hemoglobin level was 11 g per deciliter in group 1 and 10.6 g per deciliter in group 2. The preop- erative value for hemoglobin S was 31 percent in group 1 and 59 percent in group 2. The most frequent opera- tions were cholecystectomies (232), head and neck sur- gery (156), and orthopedic surgery (72). With the excep- tion of transfusion-related complications, which occurred in 14 percent of the operations in group 1 and in 7 percent of those in group 2, the frequency of serious complica- tions was similar in the two groups (31 percent in group 1 and 35 percent in group 2). The acute chest syndrome developed in 10 percent of both groups and resulted in two deaths in group 1. A history of pulmonary disease and a higher risk associated with surgery were significant pre- dictors of the acute chest syndrome. Conclusions. A conservative transfusion regimen was as effective as an aggressive regimen in preventing peri- operative complications in patients with sickle cell ane- mia, and the conservative approach resulted in only half as many transfusion-associated complications.},

abstract = {Background: Globally, sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are used to treat complications of SCD, e.g. acute chest syndrome (ACS) (this often involves a single transfusion episode), or they can be part of a regular long-term transfusion programme to prevent SCD complications.Objectives: To summarize the evidence in Cochrane Reviews of the effectiveness and safety of RBC transfusions versus no transfusion, or restrictive (to increase the total haemoglobin) versus liberal (to decrease the haemoglobin S level below a specified percentage) transfusion, for treating or preventing complications experienced by people with SCD.Methods: We included Cochrane Reviews of randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, that addressed various SCD complications and had RBC transfusion as an intervention or comparator. We assessed the methodological quality of included reviews according to the AMSTAR quality assessment.Main results: We included 15 Cochrane Reviews, 10 of which had no included studies with an RBC transfusion intervention (five reported RCTs with other interventions; and five contained no studies). Five of the 15 reviews included participants randomised to RBC transfusion, but in one of these reviews only 10 participants were randomised with no usable data. Four reviews (nine trials with 1502 participants) reported data comparing short- or long-term RBC transfusions versus standard care, disease-modifying agents, a restrictive versus a liberal transfusion strategy and long-term RBC transfusions versus transfusions to treat complications. All reviews were of high quality according to AMSTAR quality assessment, however, the quality of the included trials was highly variable across outcomes. Trials were downgraded according to GRADE methodology for risk of bias, indirectness (most trials were conducted in children with HbSS), and imprecision (outcomes had wide confidence intervals).In all four reviews and all comparisons there was little or no difference in the risk of death (very low-quality evidence). There were either no deaths or death was a rare event.Short-term RBC transfusion versus standard care (one review: two trials, 434 participants, GRADE very low- to low-quality evidence) In people undergoing low- to medium-risk surgery, RBC transfusions may decrease the risk of acute chest syndrome (ACS) in people with African haplotypes compared to standard care (low-quality evidence), but there was little or no difference in people with the Arabic haplotype (very-low quality evidence). There was also little or no difference in the risk of other SCD-related or transfusion-related complications (very-low quality evidence).Long-term RBC transfusion versus standard care (two reviews: three trials, 405 participants, very low- to moderate-quality evidence) In children and adolescents at high risk of stroke (abnormal transcranial doppler (TCD) velocities or silent cerebral infarct (SCI)), long-term RBC transfusions probably decrease the risk of stroke (moderate-quality evidence) and may decrease the risk of ACS and painful crisis compared to standard care (low-quality evidence). Long-term RBC transfusions may also decrease the risk of SCI in children with abnormal TCD velocities (low-quality evidence), but there may be little or no difference in the risk of SCI in children with normal TCD velocities and previous SCI (low-quality evidence).In children and adolescents already receiving long-term RBC transfusions for preventing stroke, in comparison to standard care, continuing long-term RBC transfusions may reduce the risk of SCI (low-quality evidence) but we do not know whether there is a difference in the risk of stroke (very-low quality evidence). In children with normal TCD velocities and SCI there was little or no diff rence in the risk of alloimmunisation or transfusion reactions, but RBC transfusions may increase the risk of iron overload (low-quality evidence).Long-term RBC transfusion versus RBC transfusion to treat complications (one review: one trial, 72 participants, very low- to low-quality evidence) In pregnant women, long-term RBC transfusions may decrease the risk of painful crisis compared to transfusion for complications (low-quality evidence); but there may be little or no difference in the risk of other SCD-related complications or transfusion reactions (very-low quality evidence).RBC transfusion versus disease-modifying agents (hydroxyurea) (two reviews: two trials; 254 participants, very low- to low-quality evidence) For primary prevention of stroke in children, with abnormal TCD and no severe vasculopathy on magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography (MRI/MRA), who have received at least one year of RBC transfusions, we do not know whether there is a difference between RBC transfusion and disease-modifying agents in the risk of stroke; SCI; ACS; or painful crisis (very-low quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in the risk of iron overload (low-quality evidence).Similarly, for secondary prevention of stroke in children and adolescents, we do not know whether there is a difference between these interventions in the risk of stroke; SCI; or ACS (very-low quality evidence); but hydroxyurea with phlebotomy may increase the risk of painful crisis and global SCD serious adverse events compared to RBC transfusion (low-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in the risk of iron overload (low-quality evidence).Restrictive versus liberal RBC transfusion strategy (one review: one trial; 230 participants, very low-quality evidence) In people undergoing cholecystectomy, there was little or no difference between strategies in the risk of SCD-related or transfusion-related complications (very-low quality evidence).Authors' conclusions: This overview provides support from two high-quality Cochrane Reviews for the use of RBC transfusions in preventing stroke in children and adolescents at high risk of stroke (abnormal TCDs or SCI) and evidence that it may decrease the risk of SCI in children with abnormal TCD velocities. In addition RBC transfusions may reduce the risk of ACS and painful crisis in this population.This overview highlights the lack of high-quality evidence in adults with SCD and the number of reviews that have no evidence for the use of RBC transfusions across a spectrum of SCD complications. Also of concern is the variable and often incomplete reporting of patient-relevant outcomes in the included trials such as SCD-related serious adverse events and quality of life.},

Abbreviations: ART, antiretroviral treatment; BP, blood pressure; CVD, cardiovascular disease; DC, drug conservation; F1.2, prothrombin fragment 1þ2; hsCRP, high sensitivity C-reactive protein; IL-6, interleukin-6; IQR, interquartile range; OD, opportunistic disease; OR, odds ratio; SMART, Strategies for Management of Anti-Retroviral Therapy; VS, viral suppression Background In the Strategies for Management of Anti-Retroviral Therapy trial, all-cause mortality was higher for participants randomized to intermittent, CD4-guided antiretroviral treatment (ART) (drug conservation [DC]) than continuous ART (viral suppression [VS]). We hypothesized that increased HIV-RNA levels following ART interruption induced activation of tissue factor pathways, thrombosis, and fibrinolysis. Methods and Findings Stored samples were used to measure six biomarkers: high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), amyloid A, amyloid P, D-dimer, and prothrombin fragment 1þ2. Two studies were conducted: (1) a nested case-control study for studying biomarker associations with mortality, and (2) a study to compare DC and VS participants for biomarker changes. For (1), markers were determined at study entry and before death (latest level) for 85 deaths and for two controls (n ¼ 170) matched on country, age, sex, and date of randomization. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated with logistic regression. For each biomarker, each of the three upper quartiles was compared to the lowest quartile. For (2), the biomarkers were assessed for 249 DC and 250 VS participants at study entry and 1 mo following randomization. Higher levels of hsCRP, IL-6, and D-dimer at study entry were significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Unadjusted ORs (highest versus lowest quartile) were 2.0 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.0-4.1; p ¼ 0.05), 8.3 (95{\%} CI, 3.3-20.8; p , 0.0001), and 12.4 (95{\%} CI, 4.2-37.0; p , 0.0001), respectively. Associations were significant after adjustment, when the DC and VS groups were analyzed separately, and when latest levels were assessed. IL-6 and D-dimer increased at 1 mo by 30{\%} and 16{\%} in the DC group and by 0{\%} and 5{\%} in the VS group (p , 0.0001 for treatment difference for both biomarkers); increases in the DC group were related to HIV-RNA levels at 1 mo (p , 0.0001). In an expanded case-control analysis (four controls per case), the OR (DC/VS) for mortality was reduced from 1.8 (95{\%} CI, 1.1-3.1; p ¼ 0.02) to 1.5 (95{\%} CI, 0.8-2.8) and 1.4 (95{\%} CI, 0.8-2.5) after adjustment for latest levels of IL-6 and D-dimer, respectively. Conclusions IL-6 and D-dimer were strongly related to all-cause mortality. Interrupting ART may further increase the risk of death by raising IL-6 and D-dimer levels. Therapies that reduce the inflammatory response to HIV and decrease IL-6 and D-dimer levels may warrant investigation. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00027352).},

abstract = {D-dimers have been discovered as by-products of fibrinolysis. In situations where the fundamental pathology is associated with increased thrombolytic activity, D-dimer assays could serve an integral role in the clinical workup, and have an already established role in the diagnosis of clinical disorders of venous thromboembolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. However, there is growing literature suggesting that this is not the only clinical scenario where D-dimers may be of significance. They may also become an important biomarker in coronary and carotid artery atherosclerosis and aortic diseases. Being a non-invasive and quick means of diagnosis, D-dimers are a cost-effective tool used for diagnosing diseases. With the future being steered in the direction of preventive cardiology, it is imperative for clinicians to understand how to effectively utilize biomarkers in order to diagnose disorders. In this context, we review D-dimer's origin, current clinical utility, and potential future applications.},

abstract = {Burkitt's lymphoma is a highly aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and is the fastest growing human tumour. The disease is associated with Epstein-Barr virus and was one of the first tumours shown to have a chromosomal translocation that activates an oncogene (c-MYC). Burkitt's lymphoma is the most common childhood cancer in areas where malaria is holoendemic. The incidence is very high in immunosuppressed patients in non-endemic areas, especially when associated with HIV infection. Outcome with intensive chemotherapy has improved and is now excellent in children, but the prognosis is poor in elderly adults. The success of intensive treatment relies on good supportive care. The therapy offered in oncology units in low-income countries is not as aggressive as in centres in high-income countries and outcomes are less successful. Adjuvant monoclonal antibody therapy with rituximab shows promise for improved outcomes and reduced toxic effects in the future. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Viscosity (eta) in a blood suspension is affected by the total hematocrit (HT) as well as by the deformability of the cells. The impact of these combined factors on the rheologic behavior of sickle cell suspensions and on guidelines for transfusion has not been explored fully. Therefore, the eta of mixtures of washed normal (AA) and sickle (SS) red cells was determined in a rotational viscosimeter as a function of the hematocrit level of SS cells (HS), HT, oxygen tension (PO2), and shear rate. The ratio HT:eta can be taken as an index of potential oxygen delivery. The optimal HT (for maximum HT:eta) became progressively higher as the HS or the HS:HT ratio was lowered: at a given HT, HT:eta rose with a decrease in HS, especially at low HS values. These data support the concept that simple transfusion alone is not as beneficial to the patient as exchange transfusion and that substantial benefit can be obtained by bringing the patient to very low HS levels. The finding that eta rose with HT more steeply when the HS:HT ratio rather than HS was held constant suggested that the absolute level of HS may be more useful than the HS:HT ratio as a guide for a transfusion regimen.},

abstract = {Hemoglobinopathies, thalassemia and sickle cell disease are among the most frequent monogenic diseases in the world. Transfusion has improved dramatically their prognosis, but provokes iron overload, which induces multiple organ damages. Iron overload is related to accumulation of iron released from hemolysis and transfused red cell, but also, in thalassemic patients, secondary to ineffective erythropoiesis, which increases intestinal iron absorption via decreased hepcidin production. Transfusion-related cardiac iron overload remains a main cause of death in thalassemia in well-resourced countries, and is responsible for severe hepatic damages in sickle cell disease. Regular monitoring by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) using myocardial T2* (ms) and Liver Iron Content (LIC) (mg of iron/g dry weight) are now standards of care in chronically transfused patients. Serum ferritin level measurements and record of the total number of transfused erythrocyte concentrates are also helpful tools. Three iron chelators are currently available, deferoxamine, which must be injected subcutaneously or intravenously, and two oral chelators, deferiprone and deferasirox. We will review the main characteristics of these drugs and their indications.},

Abbreviations: ART, antiretroviral treatment; BP, blood pressure; CVD, cardiovascular disease; DC, drug conservation; F1.2, prothrombin fragment 1þ2; hsCRP, high sensitivity C-reactive protein; IL-6, interleukin-6; IQR, interquartile range; OD, opportunistic disease; OR, odds ratio; SMART, Strategies for Management of Anti-Retroviral Therapy; VS, viral suppression Background In the Strategies for Management of Anti-Retroviral Therapy trial, all-cause mortality was higher for participants randomized to intermittent, CD4-guided antiretroviral treatment (ART) (drug conservation [DC]) than continuous ART (viral suppression [VS]). We hypothesized that increased HIV-RNA levels following ART interruption induced activation of tissue factor pathways, thrombosis, and fibrinolysis. Methods and Findings Stored samples were used to measure six biomarkers: high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), amyloid A, amyloid P, D-dimer, and prothrombin fragment 1þ2. Two studies were conducted: (1) a nested case-control study for studying biomarker associations with mortality, and (2) a study to compare DC and VS participants for biomarker changes. For (1), markers were determined at study entry and before death (latest level) for 85 deaths and for two controls (n ¼ 170) matched on country, age, sex, and date of randomization. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated with logistic regression. For each biomarker, each of the three upper quartiles was compared to the lowest quartile. For (2), the biomarkers were assessed for 249 DC and 250 VS participants at study entry and 1 mo following randomization. Higher levels of hsCRP, IL-6, and D-dimer at study entry were significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Unadjusted ORs (highest versus lowest quartile) were 2.0 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.0-4.1; p ¼ 0.05), 8.3 (95{\%} CI, 3.3-20.8; p , 0.0001), and 12.4 (95{\%} CI, 4.2-37.0; p , 0.0001), respectively. Associations were significant after adjustment, when the DC and VS groups were analyzed separately, and when latest levels were assessed. IL-6 and D-dimer increased at 1 mo by 30{\%} and 16{\%} in the DC group and by 0{\%} and 5{\%} in the VS group (p , 0.0001 for treatment difference for both biomarkers); increases in the DC group were related to HIV-RNA levels at 1 mo (p , 0.0001). In an expanded case-control analysis (four controls per case), the OR (DC/VS) for mortality was reduced from 1.8 (95{\%} CI, 1.1-3.1; p ¼ 0.02) to 1.5 (95{\%} CI, 0.8-2.8) and 1.4 (95{\%} CI, 0.8-2.5) after adjustment for latest levels of IL-6 and D-dimer, respectively. Conclusions IL-6 and D-dimer were strongly related to all-cause mortality. Interrupting ART may further increase the risk of death by raising IL-6 and D-dimer levels. Therapies that reduce the inflammatory response to HIV and decrease IL-6 and D-dimer levels may warrant investigation. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00027352).},

abstract = {Description: Although approximately 85 million units of red blood cells (RBCs) are transfused annually worldwide, transfusion practices vary widely. The AABB (formerly, the American Association of Blood Banks) developed this guideline to provide clinical recom- mendations about hemoglobin concentration thresholds and other clinical variables that trigger RBC transfusions in hemodynamically stable adults and children. Methods: These guidelines are based on a systematic review of randomized clinical trials evaluating transfusion thresholds. We per- formed a literature search from 1950 to February 2011 with no language restrictions. We examined the proportion of patients who received any RBC transfusion and the number of RBC units trans- fused to describe the effect of restrictive transfusion strategies on RBC use. To determine the clinical consequences of restrictive trans- fusion strategies, we examined overall mortality, nonfatal myocar- dial infarction, cardiac events, pulmonary edema, stroke, thrombo- embolism, renal failure, infection, hemorrhage, mental confusion, functional recovery, and length of hospital stay. Recommendation 1: The AABB recommends adhering to a restric- tive transfusion strategy (7 to 8 g/dL) in hospitalized, stable pa- tients (Grade: strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). Recommendation 2: The AABB suggests adhering to a restrictive strategy in hospitalized patients with preexisting cardiovascular dis- ease and considering transfusion for patients with symptoms or a hemoglobin level of 8 g/dL or less (Grade: weak recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Recommendation 3: The AABB cannot recommend for or against a liberal or restrictive transfusion threshold for hospi- talized, hemodynamically stable patients with the acute cor- onary syndrome (Grade: uncertain recommendation; very low-quality evidence). Recommendation 4: The AABB suggests that transfusion decisions be influenced by symptoms as well as hemoglobin concentration (Grade: weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).},

abstract = {Although many patients with venous thromboembolism require extended treatment, it is uncertain whether it is better to use full- or lower-intensity anticoagulation therapy or aspirin. METHODS In this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study, we assigned 3396 patients with venous thromboembolism to receive either once-daily rivaroxaban (at doses of 20 mg or 10 mg) or 100 mg of aspirin. All the study patients had completed 6 to 12 months of anticoagulation therapy and were in equipoise regarding the need for continued anticoagulation. Study drugs were administered for up to 12 months. The primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent fatal or nonfatal venous thromboem- bolism, and the principal safety outcome was major bleeding. RESULTS A total of 3365 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analyses (median treatment duration, 351 days). The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 17 of 1107 patients (1.5{\%}) receiving 20 mg of rivaroxaban and in 13 of 1127 patients (1.2{\%}) receiving 10 mg of rivaroxaban, as compared with 50 of 1131 patients (4.4{\%}) receiving aspirin (hazard ratio for 20 mg of rivaroxaban vs. aspirin, 0.34; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.20 to 0.59; hazard ratio for 10 mg of rivaroxaban vs. aspirin, 0.26; 95{\%} CI, 0.14 to 0.47; P{\textless}0.001 for both comparisons). Rates of major bleeding were 0.5{\%} in the group receiving 20 mg of rivaroxaban, 0.4{\%} in the group receiving 10 mg of rivaroxaban, and 0.3{\%} in the aspirin group; the rates of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding were 2.7{\%}, 2.0{\%}, and 1.8{\%}, respectively. The incidence of adverse events was similar in all three groups. The authors' full names, academic de- grees, and affiliations are listed in the Appendix.

abstract = {Background: D-dimer is produced during the fibrinolysis. A retrospective study was conducted to assess the association between D-dimer and inflammatory parameters in unselected patients with digestive diseases. Methods: All patients who were consecutively admitted to our department between January 2016 and October 2016 and underwent D-dimer tests were included. Spearman non-parametric tests and Pearson chi-square tests were performed to evaluate the correlation of D-dimer with inflammatory parameters. The correlation coefficients were calculated. Results: Overall, 205 patients (112 males and 93 females) underwent 245 D-dimer tests. Among them, 9 patients were diagnosed with pancreatitis (8 males and 1 female) and 14 patients with liver cirrhosis (6 males and 8 females). In the overall analysis, D-dimer positively correlated with white blood cell (WBC), percentage of neutrophils, neutrophil count, C reaction protein, high sensitive C reaction protein (hsCRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and blood culture detection, but negatively correlated with lymphocyte percentage and lymphocyte count. In the subgroup analysis of patients with pancreatitis, D-dimer positively correlated with hsCRP and PCT. In the subgroup analysis of patients with liver cirrhosis, D-dimer positively correlated with WBC and hsCRP. Conclusions: D-dimer may reflect the inflammation conditions in unselected patients with digestive diseases. Further validation study should focus on the patients with specific digestive diseases.},

abstract = {Abnormal sickle red blood cell (sRBC) biomechanics, including pathological deformability and adhesion, correlate with clinical severity in sickle cell disease (SCD). Clinical intravenous fluids (IVFs) of various tonicities are often used during treatment of vaso-occlusive pain episodes (VOE), the major cause of morbidity in SCD. However, evidence-based guidelines are lacking, and there is no consensus regarding which IVFs to use during VOE. Further, it is unknown how altering extracellular fluid tonicity with IVFs affects sRBC biomechanics in the microcirculation, where vaso-occlusion takes place. Here, we report how altering extracellular fluid tonicity with admixtures of clinical IVFs affects sRBC biomechanical properties by leveraging novel in vitro microfluidic models of the microcirculation, including 1 capable of deoxygenating the sRBC environment to monitor changes in microchannel occlusion risk and an "endothelialized" microvascular model that measures alterations in sRBC/endothelium adhesion under postcapillary venular conditions. Admixtures with higher tonicities (sodium = 141 mEq/L) affected sRBC biomechanics by decreasing sRBC deformability, increasing sRBC occlusion under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and increasing sRBC adhesion in our microfluidic human microvasculature models. Admixtures with excessive hypotonicity (sodium = 103 mEq/L), in contrast, decreased sRBC adhesion, but overswelling prolonged sRBC transit times in capillary-sized microchannels. Admixtures with intermediate tonicities (sodium = 111-122 mEq/L) resulted in optimal changes in sRBC biomechanics, thereby reducing the risk for vaso-occlusion in our models. These results have significant translational implications for patients with SCD and warrant a large-scale prospective clinical study addressing optimal IVF management during VOE in SCD.},

abstract = {Importance Biochemical markers of disease allow clinicians to monitor disease severity, progression, and response to treatment. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are commonly used biochemical markers of inflammatory disease. We present 2 cases that indicate that D-dimer levels may be useful as a potential biochemical marker of disease activity in certain cutaneous inflammatory conditions. Observations We report 2 cases in which clinical disease activity correlates with D-dimer levels. The first case is a woman in her 50s with a diagnosis of cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa. The second case is a man in his 20s with recurrent urticaria. In both patients, plasma D-dimer levels increased with clinical evidence of disease activity and decreased with treatment and resolution of the disease flare. Interestingly, serum C-reactive protein levels did not correlate with disease activity and were found to be normal during clinically active disease. Conclusions and Relevance We show the potential value of D-dimer measurements as a marker of vasculocentric and/or vasculopathic inflammation and suggest that vascular endothelial damage may be ongoing in certain cutaneous inflammatory conditions.},

@article{Marouf2011,
abstract = {Sickle cell anemia is an inherited disease that causes chronic hemolytic anemia. Its pathognomonic signs and symptoms are caused by hemoglobin (Hb) S, which results from a single nucleotide substitution in the $\beta$-globin gene that places the amino acid valine with glutamic acid at codon 6 of the $\beta$-globin chain. Hb S is an insoluble Hb that crystalizes at low oxygen tension and other precipitating conditions leading to rigidity of red cells and clumping in small blood vessels. Patients with sickle cell disease have a variable Hb level that may range from 7.0 to 11.0 g/dL in their steady state condition. The most common cause of hospital presentation is due to acute painful crisis that results from vaso-occlusion by sickled cells. These episodes are treated with hydration and analgesia and do not require blood transfusion. Blood transfusion should be aimed to increase tissue delivery of oxygen. Hb S is known to be a low affinity Hb and so delivers oxygen at a lower partial pressure of oxygen compared to Hb A. Even with adequate pre transfusion testing and precautions, blood transfusion is never totally safe and short or long term complications may occur. Blood transfusion in patients with sickle cell disease has only limited indications such as acute hemolytic, aplastic or sequestration crises. Chronic transfusion protocols are implemented in cases of strokes or high cerebral blood flow ultrasonic studies as a prophylactic measure. Exchange blood transfusion is used in some complications of the disease such as acute chest syndrome (ACS), priapism or peri operatively. Once it is decided to transfuse blood, the transfused blood should be Hb S negative, Rh and Kell antigen matched.},

Despite attempts to maximize adherence to and dosing of hydroxyurea, some patients continue to suffer from pain. Our institution developed a program to initiate chronic red blood cell transfusions for one year in patients clinically deemed to have high healthcare utilization from sickle cell pain, despite being prescribed hydroxyurea. Procedure: An institutional review board approved retrospective study to evaluate the health outcomes associated with a one-year red blood cell transfusion protocol in sickle cell patients experiencing recurrent pain events as compared with the health outcomes for these patients in the one year prior to receiving transfusion therapy. We performed a matched-pair analysis using a Wilcoxon signed rank to determine the impact of transfusion therapy on clinic visits, emergency department visits, hospital admissions, hospitalization days, and opioid prescriptions filled. Results: One year of transfusion therapy significantly reduced the number of total emergency department visits for pain (6 vs 2.5 pain visits/year, P = 0.005), mean hospitalizations for pain (3.4 vs 0.9 pain admissions/year), and mean hospital days per year for pain crisis (23.5 vs 4.5, P = 0.0001), as compared with the one year prior to transfusion therapy. We identified no significant difference in opioid prescriptions filled during the year of transfusion therapy.

abstract = {Many patients with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) are anaemic. This anaemia is associated with more severe CHF and a higher incidence of mortality, hospitalisation and morbidity. The only way to prove that the anaemia is causing this worsening of CHF is to correct it. We review here some of the published papers about correction of anaemia. Many studies show a positive effect of Erythropoietin (EPO) or its' derivatives when administered in combination with oral or IV iron, with improvements in left and right ventricular systolic and diastolic function, dilation and hypertrophy and renal function. In addition, a reduction in hospitalisations, diuretic dose, pulmonary artery pressure, plasma volume, heart rate, serum Brain Natriuretic Peptide levels, the inflammatory marker Interleukin 6, soluble Fas ligand - a mediator of apoptosis, and improvements in New York Heart Association class, exercise capacity, oxygen utilization, caloric intake, Quality of Life and the activity of Endothelial Progenitor Cells, have been observed. Iron deficiency may also play an important role in this anaemia, since improvements in CHF have also been reported following treatment with IV iron alone. However, until the ongoing large placebo-controlled studies of the EPO derivative darbepoetin or IV iron are completed, we will not know whether these treatments really influence CHF outcome. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {BACKGROUND D-dimer is routinely measured as part of the clinical diagnosis algorithms for venous thromboembolism (VTE). In these algorithms, low D- dimer cut-off values are used to generate a dichotomous test result that is sensitive, but very non-specific for VTE. A consequence of any test dichotomisation is loss of information that is hidden in the continuous spectrum of results. For D-dimer, the information conveyed by extremely elevated results may be particularly relevant. Our aim was to assess the differential diagnosis of extremely elevated D-dimer levels in a hospital setting. METHODS Retrospective cohort study of patients {\textgreater} 18 years with an extremely elevated ({\textgreater} 5000 $\mu$g/l; {\textgreater} 10x cut-off to exclude VTE) D-dimer test result. Electronic medical records were reviewed for diagnoses. RESULTS A total of 759 extremely elevated D-dimer results were identified. After exclusion of 120 duplicate cases, 53 patients undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and 5 cases without diagnostic information, 581 cases were analysed. Their D-dimer ranged between 5030 and 239,000 $\mu$g/l, with a mean of 17,598 $\mu$g/l (SD 22,972 $\mu$g/l). Altogether, 89{\%} of these patients had a diagnosis of VTE, sepsis and/or cancer. The prevalence was highest for pulmonary embolism (183 patients; 32{\%}), followed by cancer (168 patients; 29{\%}), sepsis (142 patients; 24{\%}), trauma/surgery (142 patients; 24{\%}), and deep vein thrombosis (73 patients; 13{\%}). CONCLUSION Although D-dimer testing has a reputation for being very non-specific, an extremely elevated D-dimer is uniquely associated with severe disease, mainly including VTE, sepsis and/or cancer. These results suggest that, even if sharply elevated D-dimers are a seemingly solitary finding, clinical suspicion of severe underlying disease should be maintained.},

abstract = {Background: Globally, sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are used to treat complications of SCD, e.g. acute chest syndrome (ACS) (this often involves a single transfusion episode), or they can be part of a regular long-term transfusion programme to prevent SCD complications.Objectives: To summarize the evidence in Cochrane Reviews of the effectiveness and safety of RBC transfusions versus no transfusion, or restrictive (to increase the total haemoglobin) versus liberal (to decrease the haemoglobin S level below a specified percentage) transfusion, for treating or preventing complications experienced by people with SCD.Methods: We included Cochrane Reviews of randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, that addressed various SCD complications and had RBC transfusion as an intervention or comparator. We assessed the methodological quality of included reviews according to the AMSTAR quality assessment.Main results: We included 15 Cochrane Reviews, 10 of which had no included studies with an RBC transfusion intervention (five reported RCTs with other interventions; and five contained no studies). Five of the 15 reviews included participants randomised to RBC transfusion, but in one of these reviews only 10 participants were randomised with no usable data. Four reviews (nine trials with 1502 participants) reported data comparing short- or long-term RBC transfusions versus standard care, disease-modifying agents, a restrictive versus a liberal transfusion strategy and long-term RBC transfusions versus transfusions to treat complications. All reviews were of high quality according to AMSTAR quality assessment, however, the quality of the included trials was highly variable across outcomes. Trials were downgraded according to GRADE methodology for risk of bias, indirectness (most trials were conducted in children with HbSS), and imprecision (outcomes had wide confidence intervals).In all four reviews and all comparisons there was little or no difference in the risk of death (very low-quality evidence). There were either no deaths or death was a rare event.Short-term RBC transfusion versus standard care (one review: two trials, 434 participants, GRADE very low- to low-quality evidence) In people undergoing low- to medium-risk surgery, RBC transfusions may decrease the risk of acute chest syndrome (ACS) in people with African haplotypes compared to standard care (low-quality evidence), but there was little or no difference in people with the Arabic haplotype (very-low quality evidence). There was also little or no difference in the risk of other SCD-related or transfusion-related complications (very-low quality evidence).Long-term RBC transfusion versus standard care (two reviews: three trials, 405 participants, very low- to moderate-quality evidence) In children and adolescents at high risk of stroke (abnormal transcranial doppler (TCD) velocities or silent cerebral infarct (SCI)), long-term RBC transfusions probably decrease the risk of stroke (moderate-quality evidence) and may decrease the risk of ACS and painful crisis compared to standard care (low-quality evidence). Long-term RBC transfusions may also decrease the risk of SCI in children with abnormal TCD velocities (low-quality evidence), but there may be little or no difference in the risk of SCI in children with normal TCD velocities and previous SCI (low-quality evidence).In children and adolescents already receiving long-term RBC transfusions for preventing stroke, in comparison to standard care, continuing long-term RBC transfusions may reduce the risk of SCI (low-quality evidence) but we do not know whether there is a difference in the risk of stroke (very-low quality evidence). In children with normal TCD velocities and SCI there was little or no diff rence in the risk of alloimmunisation or transfusion reactions, but RBC transfusions may increase the risk of iron overload (low-quality evidence).Long-term RBC transfusion versus RBC transfusion to treat complications (one review: one trial, 72 participants, very low- to low-quality evidence) In pregnant women, long-term RBC transfusions may decrease the risk of painful crisis compared to transfusion for complications (low-quality evidence); but there may be little or no difference in the risk of other SCD-related complications or transfusion reactions (very-low quality evidence).RBC transfusion versus disease-modifying agents (hydroxyurea) (two reviews: two trials; 254 participants, very low- to low-quality evidence) For primary prevention of stroke in children, with abnormal TCD and no severe vasculopathy on magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography (MRI/MRA), who have received at least one year of RBC transfusions, we do not know whether there is a difference between RBC transfusion and disease-modifying agents in the risk of stroke; SCI; ACS; or painful crisis (very-low quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in the risk of iron overload (low-quality evidence).Similarly, for secondary prevention of stroke in children and adolescents, we do not know whether there is a difference between these interventions in the risk of stroke; SCI; or ACS (very-low quality evidence); but hydroxyurea with phlebotomy may increase the risk of painful crisis and global SCD serious adverse events compared to RBC transfusion (low-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in the risk of iron overload (low-quality evidence).Restrictive versus liberal RBC transfusion strategy (one review: one trial; 230 participants, very low-quality evidence) In people undergoing cholecystectomy, there was little or no difference between strategies in the risk of SCD-related or transfusion-related complications (very-low quality evidence).Authors' conclusions: This overview provides support from two high-quality Cochrane Reviews for the use of RBC transfusions in preventing stroke in children and adolescents at high risk of stroke (abnormal TCDs or SCI) and evidence that it may decrease the risk of SCI in children with abnormal TCD velocities. In addition RBC transfusions may reduce the risk of ACS and painful crisis in this population.This overview highlights the lack of high-quality evidence in adults with SCD and the number of reviews that have no evidence for the use of RBC transfusions across a spectrum of SCD complications. Also of concern is the variable and often incomplete reporting of patient-relevant outcomes in the included trials such as SCD-related serious adverse events and quality of life.},

In situations where the fundamental pathology is associated with increased thrombolytic activity, D-dimer assays could serve an integral role in the clinical workup, and have an already established role in the diagnosis of clinical disorders of venous thromboembolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. However, there is growing literature suggesting that this is not the only clinical scenario where D-dimers may be of significance. They may also become an important biomarker in coronary and carotid artery atherosclerosis and aortic diseases. Being a non-invasive and quick means of diagnosis, D-dimers are a cost-effective tool used for diagnosing diseases. With the future being steered in the direction of preventive cardiology, it is imperative for clinicians to understand how to effectively utilize biomarkers in order to diagnose disorders. In this context, we review D-dimer's origin, current clinical utility, and potential future applications.},

abstract = {Description: Although approximately 85 million units of red blood cells (RBCs) are transfused annually worldwide, transfusion practices vary widely. The AABB (formerly, the American Association of Blood Banks) developed this guideline to provide clinical recom- mendations about hemoglobin concentration thresholds and other clinical variables that trigger RBC transfusions in hemodynamically stable adults and children. Methods: These guidelines are based on a systematic review of randomized clinical trials evaluating transfusion thresholds. We per- formed a literature search from 1950 to February 2011 with no language restrictions. We examined the proportion of patients who received any RBC transfusion and the number of RBC units trans- fused to describe the effect of restrictive transfusion strategies on RBC use. To determine the clinical consequences of restrictive trans- fusion strategies, we examined overall mortality, nonfatal myocar- dial infarction, cardiac events, pulmonary edema, stroke, thrombo- embolism, renal failure, infection, hemorrhage, mental confusion, functional recovery, and length of hospital stay. Recommendation 1: The AABB recommends adhering to a restric- tive transfusion strategy (7 to 8 g/dL) in hospitalized, stable pa- tients (Grade: strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). Recommendation 2: The AABB suggests adhering to a restrictive strategy in hospitalized patients with preexisting cardiovascular dis- ease and considering transfusion for patients with symptoms or a hemoglobin level of 8 g/dL or less (Grade: weak recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Recommendation 3: The AABB cannot recommend for or against a liberal or restrictive transfusion threshold for hospi- talized, hemodynamically stable patients with the acute cor- onary syndrome (Grade: uncertain recommendation; very low-quality evidence). Recommendation 4: The AABB suggests that transfusion decisions be influenced by symptoms as well as hemoglobin concentration (Grade: weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).},

abstract = {Although many patients with venous thromboembolism require extended treatment, it is uncertain whether it is better to use full- or lower-intensity anticoagulation therapy or aspirin. METHODS In this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study, we assigned 3396 patients with venous thromboembolism to receive either once-daily rivaroxaban (at doses of 20 mg or 10 mg) or 100 mg of aspirin. All the study patients had completed 6 to 12 months of anticoagulation therapy and were in equipoise regarding the need for continued anticoagulation. Study drugs were administered for up to 12 months. The primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent fatal or nonfatal venous thromboem- bolism, and the principal safety outcome was major bleeding. RESULTS A total of 3365 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analyses (median treatment duration, 351 days). The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 17 of 1107 patients (1.5{\%}) receiving 20 mg of rivaroxaban and in 13 of 1127 patients (1.2{\%}) receiving 10 mg of rivaroxaban, as compared with 50 of 1131 patients (4.4{\%}) receiving aspirin (hazard ratio for 20 mg of rivaroxaban vs. aspirin, 0.34; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.20 to 0.59; hazard ratio for 10 mg of rivaroxaban vs. aspirin, 0.26; 95{\%} CI, 0.14 to 0.47; P{\textless}0.001 for both comparisons). Rates of major bleeding were 0.5{\%} in the group receiving 20 mg of rivaroxaban, 0.4{\%} in the group receiving 10 mg of rivaroxaban, and 0.3{\%} in the aspirin group; the rates of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding were 2.7{\%}, 2.0{\%}, and 1.8{\%}, respectively. The incidence of adverse events was similar in all three groups. The authors' full names, academic de- grees, and affiliations are listed in the Appendix.

abstract = {BACKGROUND D-dimer is routinely measured as part of the clinical diagnosis algorithms for venous thromboembolism (VTE). In these algorithms, low D- dimer cut-off values are used to generate a dichotomous test result that is sensitive, but very non-specific for VTE. A consequence of any test dichotomisation is loss of information that is hidden in the continuous spectrum of results. For D-dimer, the information conveyed by extremely elevated results may be particularly relevant. Our aim was to assess the differential diagnosis of extremely elevated D-dimer levels in a hospital setting. METHODS Retrospective cohort study of patients {\textgreater} 18 years with an extremely elevated ({\textgreater} 5000 $\mu$g/l; {\textgreater} 10x cut-off to exclude VTE) D-dimer test result. Electronic medical records were reviewed for diagnoses. RESULTS A total of 759 extremely elevated D-dimer results were identified. After exclusion of 120 duplicate cases, 53 patients undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and 5 cases without diagnostic information, 581 cases were analysed. Their D-dimer ranged between 5030 and 239,000 $\mu$g/l, with a mean of 17,598 $\mu$g/l (SD 22,972 $\mu$g/l). Altogether, 89{\%} of these patients had a diagnosis of VTE, sepsis and/or cancer. The prevalence was highest for pulmonary embolism (183 patients; 32{\%}), followed by cancer (168 patients; 29{\%}), sepsis (142 patients; 24{\%}), trauma/surgery (142 patients; 24{\%}), and deep vein thrombosis (73 patients; 13{\%}). CONCLUSION Although D-dimer testing has a reputation for being very non-specific, an extremely elevated D-dimer is uniquely associated with severe disease, mainly including VTE, sepsis and/or cancer. These results suggest that, even if sharply elevated D-dimers are a seemingly solitary finding, clinical suspicion of severe underlying disease should be maintained.},

abstract = {Abnormal sickle red blood cell (sRBC) biomechanics, including pathological deformability and adhesion, correlate with clinical severity in sickle cell disease (SCD). Clinical intravenous fluids (IVFs) of various tonicities are often used during treatment of vaso-occlusive pain episodes (VOE), the major cause of morbidity in SCD. However, evidence-based guidelines are lacking, and there is no consensus regarding which IVFs to use during VOE. Further, it is unknown how altering extracellular fluid tonicity with IVFs affects sRBC biomechanics in the microcirculation, where vaso-occlusion takes place. Here, we report how altering extracellular fluid tonicity with admixtures of clinical IVFs affects sRBC biomechanical properties by leveraging novel in vitro microfluidic models of the microcirculation, including 1 capable of deoxygenating the sRBC environment to monitor changes in microchannel occlusion risk and an "endothelialized" microvascular model that measures alterations in sRBC/endothelium adhesion under postcapillary venular conditions. Admixtures with higher tonicities (sodium = 141 mEq/L) affected sRBC biomechanics by decreasing sRBC deformability, increasing sRBC occlusion under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and increasing sRBC adhesion in our microfluidic human microvasculature models. Admixtures with excessive hypotonicity (sodium = 103 mEq/L), in contrast, decreased sRBC adhesion, but overswelling prolonged sRBC transit times in capillary-sized microchannels. Admixtures with intermediate tonicities (sodium = 111-122 mEq/L) resulted in optimal changes in sRBC biomechanics, thereby reducing the risk for vaso-occlusion in our models. These results have significant translational implications for patients with SCD and warrant a large-scale prospective clinical study addressing optimal IVF management during VOE in SCD.},
