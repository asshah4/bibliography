abstract = {AIMS:The density HRV parameter Dyx is a new heart rate variability (HRV) measure based on multipole analysis of the Poincar{\'{e}} plot obtained from RR interval time series, deriving information from both the time and frequency domain. Preliminary results have suggested that the parameter may provide new predictive information on mortality in survivors of acute myocardial infarction (MI). This study compares the prognostic significance of Dyx to that of traditional linear and nonlinear measures of HRV.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS:In the Nordic ICD pilot study, patients with an acute MI were screened with 2D echocardiography and 24-hour Holter recordings. The study was designed to assess the power of several HRV measures to predict mortality. Dyx was tested in a subset of 206 consecutive Danish patients with analysable Holter recordings. After a median follow-up of 8.5 years 70 patients had died. Of all traditional and multipole HRV parameters, reduced Dyx was the most powerful predictor of all-cause mortality (HR 2.4; CI 1.5 to 3.8; P {\textless} 0.001). After adjustment for known risk markers, such as age, diabetes, ejection fraction, previous MI and hypertension, Dyx remained an independent predictor of mortality (P = 0.02). Reduced Dyx also predicted cardiovascular death (P {\textless} 0.01) and sudden cardiovascular death (P = 0.05). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, Dyx significantly predicted mortality in patients both with and without impaired left ventricular systolic function (P {\textless} 0.0001).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION:The new nonlinear HRV measure Dyx is a promising independent predictor of mortality in a long-term follow-up study of patients surviving a MI, irrespectively of left ventricular systolic function.},

abstract = {Despite the revolutionary advancements in the past 3 decades in the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias with device-based therapy, sudden cardiac death (SCD) remains an enormous public health burden. Survivors of SCD are generally at high risk for recurrent events. The clinical management of such patients requires a multidisciplinary approach from postresuscitative care to a thorough cardiovascular investigation in an attempt to identify the underlying substrate, with potential to eliminate or modify the triggers through catheter ablation and ultimately an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for prompt treatment of recurrences in those at risk. Early recognition of low left ventricular ejection fraction as a strong predictor of death and association of ventricular arrhythmias with sudden death led to significant investigation with antiarrhythmic drugs. The lack of efficacy and the proarrhythmic effects of drugs catalyzed the development and investigation of the ICD through several major clinical trials that proved the efficacy of ICD as a bedrock tool to detect and promptly treat life-threatening arrhythmias. The ICD therapy is routinely used for primary prevention of SCD in patients with cardiomyopathy and high risk inherited arrhythmic conditions and secondary prevention in survivors of sudden cardiac arrest. This compendium will review the clinical management of those surviving SCD and discuss landmark studies of antiarrhythmic drugs, ICD, and cardiac resynchronization therapy in the primary and secondary prevention of SCD.},

Here we will review the historic basis of cardiac sympathectomy for the management of life-threatening arrhythmias and will then discuss the often forgotten critical experimental studies that provided the rationale for the amazing growth of its role in clinical management. We will then mention the evolution in the surgical approaches, with their pros and cons. Similarly, we will address the existence of different views on the wisdom of starting with unilateral LCSD versus performing at outset bilateral CSD. The main results in the two diseases for which LCSD has already a definite role (namely the long QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia) will be reviewed and discussed, touching also on the medico-legal implications descending from the clear efficacy of LCSD for these conditions. Finally, we will consider the potential value of LCSD for other clinical conditions and will close by mentioning a new randomized clinical trial in which LCSD is performed in patients with heart failure.},

Recognition and analysis of such links in the pathogenesis of malignant cardiac arrhythmia are emphasized in this review. Neurocardiac links have been shown to produce arrhythmia both experimentally and clinically; specific examples, including stroke, epilepsy, and environmental stress are presented. We hypothesize that the individual with a diseased heart has a greater likelihood of experiencing cardiac arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death when the neurocardiac axis is activated. Reviewing possible mechanisms of brain-related arrhythmias, we suggest that the nervous system directs the events leading to cardiac damage by raising catecholamine levels and potentially inducing arrhythmia.},

abstract = {Background: Psychological stress is a risk factor for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in individuals with coronary artery disease. Certain brain regions that control both emotional states and cardiac physiology may be involved in this relationship. The rostromedial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC) is an important brain region that processes stress and regulates immune and autonomic functions. Changes in rmPFC activity with emotional stress (reactivity) may be informative of future risk for MACE. Methods: Participants with stable coronary artery disease underwent acute mental stress testing using a series of standardized speech/arithmetic stressors and simultaneous brain imaging with high-resolution positron emission tomography brain imaging. We defined high rmPFC activation as a difference between stress and control scans greater than the median value for the entire cohort. Interleukin-6 levels 90 minutes after stress, and high-frequency heart rate variability during stress were also assessed. We defined MACE as a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina with revascularization, and heart failure hospitalization. Results: We studied 148 subjects (69{\%} male) with meanÂ±SD age of 62Â±8 years. After adjustment for baseline demographics, risk factors, and baseline levels of interleukin-6 and high-frequency heart rate variability, higher rmPFC stress reactivity was independently associated with higher interleukin-6 and lower high-frequency heart rate variability with stress. During a median follow-up of 3 years, 34 subjects (21.3{\%}) experienced a MACE. Each increase of 1 SD in rmPFC activation with mental stress was associated with a 21{\%} increase risk of MACE (hazard ratio, 1.21 [95{\%} CI, 1.08-1.37]). Stress-induced interleukin-6 and high-frequency heart rate variability explained 15.5{\%} and 32.5{\%} of the relationship between rmPFC reactivity and MACE, respectively. Addition of rmPFC reactivity to conventional risk factors improved risk reclassification for MACE prediction, and C-statistic improved from 0.71 to 0.76 (P=0.03). Conclusions: Greater rmPFC stress reactivity is associated with incident MACE. Immune and autonomic responses to mental stress may play a contributory role.},

Experimental data show that left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD), in particular, is not only antiarrhythmic, but also antifibrillatory-an effect exquisitely important for any clinical condition associated with a high risk of ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. LCSD has additional effects on both the coronary circulation and the mechanical performance of the left ventricle, with important implications for patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Evidence also shows that LCSD increases the vagal activity directed to the heart, which has potential implications for the management of heart failure. In this Review, the current and novel clinical indications for LCSD are discussed, particularly in the context of results obtained in patients with channelopathies, such as long QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.$\backslash$n},

The data, past illnesses, prodromal symptoms, and psychosocial information were obtained from the plant medical records, the private physicians, and mainly from direct interviews with the surviving next-of-kin, usually the wife. The data suggest that the majority of these patients, all men, had been depressed for a week up to several months. The sudden death then occurred in a setting of acute arousal engendered by increased work and activity or circumstances precipitating reactions of anxiety or anger. The findings suggest that the combination of depressive and arousal psychological states or abrupt transition from one such state to another may produce disharmonious responses in the hormonal and autonomic nervous systems, as well as central nervous system mediated behavior, which are conducive to the sudden death},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Abnormalities in the autonomic nervous system may occur in ischemic heart disease, but the mechanisms by which they are linked are not fully defined. The risk of cardiac events is increased during morning hours. Studying the contributions of autonomic mechanisms may yield insights into risk stratification and treatment. We hypothesize that autonomic dysfunction, measured by decreased heart rate variability (HRV), associates with abnormal stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). METHODS We performed a cross-sectional study of the association between abnormal myocardial stress perfusion with HRV using 276 middle-aged veteran twins without known ischemic heart disease. The primary independent variable was cardiac autonomic regulation measured with 24-hour electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, using linear and non-linear (multipole density, or Dyx) HRV metrics. The primary outcome was abnormal perfusion ({\textgreater}5{\%} affected myocardium) during adenosine stress on [13N]-ammonia myocardial perfusion imaging with positron emission tomography. RESULTS The mean (SD) age was 53 (3) years and 55 (20{\%}) had abnormal perfusion. HRV (by Dyx) was reduced during morning hours in subjects with abnormal perfusion. At 7 AM, each standard deviation (SD) decrease in Dyx was associated a 4.8 (95{\%} CI, 1.5 - 15.8) odds ratio (OR) for abnormal MPI. With Dyx {\textless} 2.0, the 7 AM OR for abnormal MPI was 11.8 (95{\%} CI, 1.2 - 111.4). CONCLUSIONS Autonomic dysfunction, measured by non-linear HRV in the morning hours, was associated with an increased OR of abnormal MPI. These results suggest a potentially important role of ECG-based biomarkers in risk stratification for individuals with suspected ischemic heart disease.},

abstract = {The modern treatment of cardiac arrest is an increasingly complex medical procedure with a rapidly changing array of therapeutic approaches designed to restore life to victims of sudden death. The 2 primary goals of providing artificial circulation and defibrillation to halt ventricular fibrillation remain of paramount importance for saving lives. They have undergone significant improvements in technology and dissemination into the community subsequent to their establishment 60 years ago. The evolution of artificial circulation includes efforts to optimize manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation, external mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices designed to augment circulation, and may soon advance further into the rapid deployment of specially designed internal emergency cardiopulmonary bypass devices. The development of defibrillation technologies has progressed from bulky internal defibrillators paddles applied directly to the heart, to manually controlled external defibrillators, to automatic external defibrillators that can now be obtained over-the-counter for widespread use in the community or home. But the modern treatment of cardiac arrest now involves more than merely providing circulation and defibrillation. As suggested by a 3-phase model of treatment, newer approaches targeting patients who have had a more prolonged cardiac arrest include treatment of the metabolic phase of cardiac arrest with therapeutic hypothermia, agents to treat or prevent reperfusion injury, new strategies specifically focused on pulseless electric activity, which is the presenting rhythm in at least one third of cardiac arrests, and aggressive post resuscitation care. There are discoveries at the cellular and molecular level about ischemia and reperfusion pathobiology that may be translated into future new therapies. On the near horizon is the combination of advanced cardiopulmonary bypass plus a cocktail of multiple agents targeted at restoration of normal metabolism and prevention of reperfusion injury, as this holds the promise of restoring life to many patients for whom our current therapies fail.},

abstract = {Despite improvements in the therapy of underlying heart disease, sudden cardiac death is a major cause of death worldwide. Disturbed Na and Ca handling is known to be a major predisposing factor for life-threatening tachyarrhythmias. In cardiomyocytes, many ion channels and transporters, including voltage-gated Na and Ca channels, cardiac ryanodine receptors, Na/Ca-exchanger, and SR Ca-ATPase are involved in this regulation. We have learned a lot about the pathophysiological relevance of disturbed ion channel function from monogenetic disorders. Changes in the gating of a single ion channel and the activity of an ion pump suffice to dramatically increase the propensity for arrhythmias even in structurally normal hearts. Nevertheless, patients with heart failure with acquired dysfunction in many ion channels and transporters exhibit profound dysregulation of Na and Ca handling and Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and are especially prone to arrhythmias. A deeper understanding of the underlying arrhythmic principles is mandatory if we are to improve their outcome. This review addresses basic tachyarrhythmic mechanisms, the underlying ionic mechanisms and the consequences for ion homeostasis, and the situation in complex diseases like heart failure.},

abstract = {Hypertension (HTN) is the most common cause of hypertensive heart disease, which comprises of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), left atrial enlargement, diastolic dysfunction, functional mitral regurgitation and neurohormonal changes. All of these lead to significant arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation (AF) as well as ventricular arrhythmias, and are known risk factors for sudden cardiac death (SCD). The association between LVH and SCD is well established, especially in the presence of myocardial ischemia, fibrosis and scar tissue, and AF. Inflammation, fibrosis and oxidative stress, as well as ischemia play a significant role and are the leading pathways to remodeling, arrhythmias, and SCD. Aggressive HTN control may lead, at least in part, to regression of LVH and thus lower the risk of AF and SCD. Therefore, LVH is a powerful, independent predictor of AF, ventricular arrhythmias and SCD, and is significantly underrecognized. Further investigation of the relationship and management of diastolic dysfunction, LVH and genetic factors and their association with SCD is certainly warranted.},

abstract = {Syncope is a clinical syndrome defined as a relatively brief self-limited transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) caused by a period of inadequate cerebral nutrient flow. Most often the trigger is an abrupt drop of systemic blood pressure. True syncope must be distinguished from other common non-syncope conditions in which real or apparent TLOC may occur such as seizures, concussions, or accidental falls. The causes of syncope are diverse, but in most instances, are relatively benign (e.g., reflex and orthostatic faints) with the main risks being accidents and/or injury. However, in some instances, syncope may be due to more worrisome conditions (particularly those associated with cardiac structural disease or channelopathies); in such circumstances, syncope may be an indicator of increased morbidity and mortality risk, including sudden cardiac death (SCD). Establishing an accurate basis for the etiology of syncope is crucial in order to initiate effective therapy. In this review, we focus primarily on the causes of syncope that are associated with increased SCD risk (i.e., sudden arrhythmic cardiac death), and the management of these patients. In addition, we discuss the limitations of our understanding of SCD in relation to syncope, and propose future studies that may ultimately address how to improve outcomes of syncope patients and reduce SCD risk.},

abstract = {Heart failure and related morbidity and mortality are increasing at an alarming rate, in large part, because of increases in aging, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. The clinical outcomes associated with heart failure are considerably worse for patients with diabetes mellitus than for those without diabetes mellitus. In people with diabetes mellitus, the presence of myocardial dysfunction in the absence of overt clinical coronary artery disease, valvular disease, and other conventional cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, has led to the descriptive terminology, diabetic cardiomyopathy. The prevalence of diabetic cardiomyopathy is increasing in parallel with the increase in diabetes mellitus. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is initially characterized by myocardial fibrosis, dysfunctional remodeling, and associated diastolic dysfunction, later by systolic dysfunction, and eventually by clinical heart failure. Impaired cardiac insulin metabolic signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, increases in oxidative stress, reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, elevations in advanced glycation end products and collagen-based cardiomyocyte and extracellular matrix stiffness, impaired mitochondrial and cardiomyocyte calcium handling, inflammation, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation, cardiac autonomic neuropathy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, microvascular dysfunction, and a myriad of cardiac metabolic abnormalities have all been implicated in the development and progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Molecular mechanisms linked to the underlying pathophysiological changes include abnormalities in AMP-Activated protein kinase, peroxisome proliferator-Activated receptors, O-linked N-Acetylglucosamine, protein kinase C, microRNA, and exosome pathways. The aim of this review is to provide a contemporary view of these instigators of diabetic cardiomyopathy, as well as mechanistically based strategies for the prevention and treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Abnormal QT intervals, long QT or short QT, have been epidemiologically linked with sudden cardiac death because of ventricular fibrillation (VF). Consequently, Food and Drug Administration recommends testing all pharmacological agents for QT toxicity as a risk factor for cardiac toxicity. Such tests assess QT/QTc interval, which represents ventricular depolarization and repolarization. However, the current QT toxicity analysis does not account for the well-known anisotropy in cardiac tissue conductivity. Mines demonstrated in 1913 that cardiac wavelength ($\lambda$) determines inducibility of reentrant arrhythmia, where both repolarization time or action potential duration and conduction velocity determine $\lambda$=action potential durationÃconduction velocity. We aimed to determine the role of anisotropic wavelength in inducibility of VF in explanted human left ventricular preparations. We tested the hypothesis that 3-dimensional cardiac wavelength, which takes into account anisotropic cardiac tissue conductivity, can accurately predict VF sustainability. METHODS We conducted panoramic optical mapping of coronary perfused human left ventricular wedge preparations subjected to pharmacologically induced shortening and prolongation of action potential duration, by IK,ATP agonist pinacidil and antagonist glybenclamide, respectively. This measured action potential duration, conduction velocity, and thus determined pacing cycle length-dependent wavelengths in longitudinal ($\lambda$L), transverse ($\lambda$TV), and transmural ($\lambda$TM) directions using S1S1 pacing protocol, from which wavelength volume (V$\lambda$) was determined, as V$\lambda$=$\lambda$LÃ$\lambda$TVÃ$\lambda$TM, and compared with tissue volume. We tested a hypothesis that tissue volume/V$\lambda$ ratio can predict VF sustainability. RESULTS At baseline, at pacing rate of 240 beats per minute, the wavelengths were $\lambda$L=9.6Â±0.6 cm, $\lambda$TV=4.2Â±0.3 cm, and $\lambda$TM=5.8Â±0.2 cm, respectively (n=7), and thus V$\lambda$=246.4Â±42.1 cm3. Administration of pinacidil at escalating concentrations progressively decreased V$\lambda$, and VF became sustained, when tissue volume/V$\lambda$ was above safety factor $\kappa$=4.4Â±0.6 (n=9) during rapid pacing. Treatment with glybenclamide decreased VT/V$\lambda$ below $\kappa$ at any pacing rate and prevented VF sustainability. CONCLUSIONS Sustained VF was only sustained in ventricular volume exceeding critical V$\lambda$=$\lambda$LÃ$\lambda$TVÃ$\lambda$TM.},

abstract = {Background: Decreased vagal activity after myocardial infarction results in reduced heart-rate variability and increased risk of death. To distinguish between vagal and sympathetic factors that affect heart-rate variability, we used a signal-processing algorithm to separately characterise deceleration and acceleration of heart rate. We postulated that diminished deceleration-related modulation of heart rate is an important prognostic marker. Our prospective hypotheses were that deceleration capacity is a better predictor of risk than left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN). Methods: We quantified heart rate deceleration capacity by assessing 24-h Holter recordings from a post-infarction cohort in Munich (n=1455). We blindly validated the prognostic power of deceleration capacity in post-infarction populations in London, UK (n=656), and Oulu, Finland (n=600). We tested our hypotheses by assessment of the area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve (AUC). Findings: During a median follow-up of 24 months, 70 people died in the Munich cohort and 66 in the London cohort. The Oulu cohort was followed-up for 38 months and 77 people died. In the London cohort, mean AUC of deceleration capacity was 0{\textperiodcentered}80 (SD 0{\textperiodcentered}03) compared with 0{\textperiodcentered}67 (0{\textperiodcentered}04) for LVEF and 0{\textperiodcentered}69 (0{\textperiodcentered}04) for SDNN. In the Oulu cohort, mean AUC of deceleration capacity was 0{\textperiodcentered}74 (0{\textperiodcentered}03) compared with 0{\textperiodcentered}60 (0{\textperiodcentered}04) for LVEF and 0{\textperiodcentered}64 (0{\textperiodcentered}03) for SDNN (p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001 for all comparisons). Stratification by dichotomised deceleration capacity was especially powerful in patients with preserved LVEF (p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001 in all cohorts). Interpretation: Impaired heart rate deceleration capacity is a powerful predictor of mortality after myocardial infarction and is more accurate than LVEF and the conventional measures of heart-rate variability. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Background - The incremental prognostic value of stress single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for the prediction of cardiac death as an individual end point and the implications for risk stratification are undefined. Methods and Results - We identified 5183 consecutive patients who underwent stress/rest SPECT and were followed up for the occurrence of cardiac death or myocardial infarction. Over a mean follow up of 642Â±226 days, 119 cardiac deaths and 158 myocardial infarctions occurred (3.0{\%} cardiac death rate, 2.3{\%} myocardial infarction rate). Patients with normal scans were at low risk (â¤0.5{\%}/y), and rates of both outcomes increased significantly with worsening scan abnormalities. Patients who underwent exercise stress and had mildly abnormal scans had low rates of cardiac death but higher rates of myocardial infarction (0.7{\%}/y versus 2.6{\%}/y; P{\textless}.05). After adjustment for prescan information, scan results provided incremental prognostic value toward the prediction of cardiac death. The identification of patients at intermediate risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction and low risk for cardiac death by SPECT may result in significant cost savings when applied to a clinical testing strategy. Conclusions - Myocardial perfusion SPECT yields incremental prognostic information toward the identification of cardiac death. Patients with mildly abnormal scans after exercise stress are at low risk for cardiac death but intermediate risk for nonfatal myocardial infarction and thus may benefit from a noninvasive strategy and may not require invasive management.},

abstract = {The steady-state basal plasma glucose and insulin concentrations are determined by their interaction in a feedback loop. A computer-solved model has been used to predict the homeostatic concentrations which arise from varying degrees of $\beta$-cell deficiency and insulin resistance. Comparison of a patient's fasting values with the model's predictions allows a quantitative assessment of the contributions of insulin resistance and deficient $\beta$-cell function to the fasting hyperglycaemia (homeostasis model assessment, HOMA). The accuracy and precision of the estimate have been determined by comparison with independent measures of insulin resistance and $\beta$-cell function using hyperglycaemic and euglycaemic clamps and an intravenous glucose tolerance test. The estimate of insulin resistance obtained by homeostasis model assessment correlated with estimates obtained by use of the euglycaemic clamp (Rs = 0.88, p {\textless} 0.0001), the fasting insulin concentration (Rs = 0.81, p {\textless} 0.0001), and the hyperglycaemic clamp, (Rs = 0.69, p {\textless} 0.01). There was no correlation with any aspect of insulin-receptor binding. The estimate of deficient $\beta$-cell function obtained by homeostasis model assessment correlated with that derived using the hyperglycaemic clamp (Rs = 0.61, p {\textless} 0.01) and with the estimate from the intravenous glucose tolerance test (Rs = 0.64, p {\textless} 0.05). The low precision of the estimates from the model (coefficients of variation: 31{\%} for insulin resistance and 32{\%} for $\beta$-cell deficit) limits its use, but the correlation of the model's estimates with patient data accords with the hypothesis that basal glucose and insulin interactions are largely determined by a simple feed back loop. {\textcopyright} 1985 Springer-Verlag.},

In large arteries, the terminals are regularly distributed around the entire circumference, the fibres being situated between the elastic lamellae of the adventitia. The terminals within the media could not be detected. In small arteries, the sympathetic ground plexus aggregates in two parallel strands, the artery being between them. In arterioles, two thick fibres only accompany the vellel. The myocardium is innervated by means of a three-dimensional sympathetic ground plexus distributed between the myocardial cells independently of vessels. No difference in density of innervation was found between the right and left heart. The point-counting method, on the other hand, has revealed that the density of innervation in the left auricle is nearly twice as dense as in the left ventricle.

Although it is generally well accepted that the autonomic nervous system can promote, precipitate, or prevent the development of cardiac arrhythmias, the mechanisms by which this transpires are incompletely understood. Several excellent recent reviews provide an overall discussion of the role of the autonomic nervous system and the genesis of cardiac arrhythmias.12 This review will focus on selected recent observations concerning autonomic innervation of the heart, the effects of myocardial ischemia and infarction on such innervation, and how some of these changes can modulate the development of cardiac arrhythmias. Autonomic Innervation of Heart Extracardiac Nerves Numerous studies to determine extracardiac neu-ral innervation to the heart reveal that although significant overlap and complex patterns exist, in general autonomic neural input to the heart exhibits some degree of "sidedness." The right sympathetic and vagus nerves affect the sinus node more than the atrioventricular (AV) node, whereas the left sympathetic and vagus nerves affect the AV node more than the sinus node. Precise points of entry of parasympathetic nerves to the sinus and AV nodal regions have recently been described.3 On the right, vagal input to the superior atrial and sinus nodal regions is by neural projections along the superior vena cava-right atrial junction, azygos vein, right pulmonary vein complex, and dorsal surfaces of the common pulmonary vein complex. On the left, vagal input to the sinus nodal region is quantitatively less,},

abstract = {The movement of ions across specific channels embedded on the membrane of individual cardiomyocytes is crucial for the generation and propagation of the cardiac electric impulse. Emerging evidence over the past 20 years strongly suggests that the normal electric function of the heart is the result of dynamic interactions of membrane ion channels working in an orchestrated fashion as part of complex molecular networks. Such networks work together with exquisite temporal precision to generate each action potential and contraction. Macromolecular complexes play crucial roles in transcription, translation, oligomerization, trafficking, membrane retention, glycosylation, post-translational modification, turnover, function, and degradation of all cardiac ion channels known to date. In addition, the accurate timing of each cardiac beat and contraction demands, a comparable precision on the assembly and organizations of sodium, calcium, and potassium channel complexes within specific subcellular microdomains, where physical proximity allows for prompt and efficient interaction. This review article, part of the Compendium on Sudden Cardiac Death, discusses the major issues related to the role of ion channel macromolecular assemblies in normal cardiac electric function and the mechanisms of arrhythmias leading to sudden cardiac death. It provides an idea of how these issues are being addressed in the laboratory and in the clinic, which important questions remain unanswered, and what future research will be needed to improve knowledge and advance therapy.},

abstract = {Sudden cardiac death (SCD) from cardiac arrest is a major international public health problem accounting for an estimated 15{\%}-20{\%} of all deaths. Although resuscitation rates are generally improving throughout the world, the majority of individuals who experience a sudden cardiac arrest will not survive. SCD most often develops in older adults with acquired structural heart disease, but it also rarely occurs in the young, where it is more commonly because of inherited disorders. Coronary heart disease is known to be the most common pathology underlying SCD, followed by cardiomyopathies, inherited arrhythmia syndromes, and valvular heart disease. During the past 3 decades, declines in SCD rates have not been as steep as for other causes of coronary heart disease deaths, and there is a growing fraction of SCDs not due to coronary heart disease and ventricular arrhythmias, particularly among certain subsets of the population. The growing heterogeneity of the pathologies and mechanisms underlying SCD present major challenges for SCD prevention, which are magnified further by a frequent lack of recognition of the underlying cardiac condition before death. Multifaceted preventative approaches, which address risk factors in seemingly low-risk and known high-risk populations, will be required to decrease the burden of SCD. In this Compendium, we review the wide-ranging spectrum of epidemiology underlying SCD within both the general population and in high-risk subsets with established cardiac disease placing an emphasis on recent global trends, remaining uncertainties, and potential targeted preventive strategies.},

abstract = {This review examines current knowledge of the effects of higher brain centres and autonomic control loops on the heart with particular relevance to arrhythmogenesis. There is now substantial evidence that higher brain function (cortex), the brain stem and autonomic nerves affect cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia, and that these may function as an interactive system. The roles of mental stress and emotion in arrhythmogenesis and sudden cardiac death are no longer confined to the realms of anecdote. Advances in molecular cardiology have identified cardiac cellular ion channel mutations conferring vulnerability to arrhythmic death at the myocardial level. Indeed, specific channelopathies such as long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome are selectively sensitive to either sympathetic or vagal stimulation. There is increasing evidence that afferent feedback from the heart to the higher centres may affect efferent input to the heart and modulate the cardiac electrophysiology. The new era of functional neuroimaging has identified the central neural circuitry in this brain-heart axis. Since precipitants of sudden fatal arrhythmia are frequently environmental and behavioural, central pathways translating stress into autonomic effects on the heart might be considered as therapeutic targets. These brain-heart interactions help explain the apparent randomness of sudden cardiac events and provide new insights into future novel therapies to prevent sudden death.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although sudden cardiac death (SCD) is relatively common, contemporary data on its incidence are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the current incidence of SCD and its trend over the past 2 decades in a general middle-aged and elderly population. METHODS: This study was performed within the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based cohort study of persons aged 45 years and older. Age-standardized incidence rates of SCD were calculated. To study trends in incidence, we compared 2 subcohorts within the total study population, 1 followed from 1990-2000 and the other from 2001-2010. RESULTS: From 1990-2010, 5512 of 14,628 participants died, of whom 583 (4.0{\%}) were classified as SCD. The overall incidence was 4.2 per 1000 person-years. The incidence was higher in men (5.2 per 1000 person-years) than in women (3.6 per 1000 person-years). Age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.84 (95{\%} confidence [CI] 1.56-2.17) and risk of SCD increased with age (HR 1.10 per year; 95{\%} CI 1.09 -1.11). The incidence rate from 1990-2000 was 4.7 per 1000 person-years vs 2.1 per 1000 person-years from 2001-2010 (age- and sex-adjusted HR of SCD 0.60, 95{\%} CI 0.44-0.80). To check for cohort effects, we also analyzed the incidence of total mortality and found an age- and sex-adjusted HR of total mortality of 0.82 (95{\%} CI 0.75-0.90) for the second compared to the first subcohort, which was significantly higher than the decline in SCD incidence. CONCLUSION: We found an incidence of SCD of 4.2 per 1000 person-years. The incidence decreased from 1990-2010, a period during which the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease greatly improved.},

The goal of this study was to evaluate the relationship between low HRV and SCD in a community-based cohort. Our cohort consisted of 12,543 participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. HRV measures were derived from 2-minute electrocardiogram recordings obtained during the baseline exam (1987â89). Time domain measurements included the standard deviation of all normal RR intervals (SDNN) and the root mean squared successive difference (r-MSSD). Frequency domain measurements included low frequency power (LF) and high frequency (HF) power. During a median follow-up of 13 years, 215 SCDs were identified from physician adjudication of all coronary heart disease deaths through 2001. In multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, each standard deviation decrement in SDNN, LF, and HF were associated with 24{\%}, 27{\%} and 16{\%} increase in SCD risk, respectively. Low HRV is independently associated with increased risk of SCD in the general population.},

abstract = {Coronary artery disease is prevalent in different causes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), especially in individuals presenting with shockable rhythms of ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/pVT). The purpose of this report is to review the known prevalence and potential importance of coronary artery disease in patients with OHCA and to describe the emerging paradigm of treatment with advanced perfusion/reperfusion techniques and their potential benefits on the basis of available evidence. Although randomized clinical trials are planned or ongoing, current scientific evidence rests principally on observational case series with their potential confounding selection bias. Among patients resuscitated from VF/pVT OHCA with ST-segment elevation on their postresuscitation ECG, the prevalence of coronary artery disease has been shown to be 70{\%} to 85{\%}. More than 90{\%} of these patients have had successful percutaneous coronary intervention. Conversely, among patients resuscitated from VF/pVT OHCA without ST-segment elevation on their postresuscitation ECG, the prevalence of coronary artery disease has been shown to be 25{\%} to 50{\%}. For these patients, early access to the cardiac catheterization laboratory is associated with a 10{\%} to 15{\%} absolute higher functionally favorable survival rate compared with more conservative approaches of late or no access to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. In patients with VF/pVT OHCA refractory to standard treatment, a new treatment paradigm is also emerging that uses venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to facilitate return of normal perfusion and to support further resuscitation efforts, including coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention. The burden of coronary artery disease is high in this patient population, presumably causative in most patients. The strategy of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, coronary angiography, and percutaneous coronary intervention has resulted in functionally favorable survival rates ranging from 9{\%} to 45{\%} in observational studies in this patient population. Patients with VF/pVT should be considered at the highest severity in the continuum of acute coronary syndromes. These patients have a significant burden of coronary artery disease and acute coronary thrombotic events. Evidence from randomized trials will further define optimal clinical practice.},

The Statistical Update represents a critical resource for the lay public, policy makers, media professionals, clinicians, healthcare administrators, researchers, health advocates, and others seeking the best available data on these factors and conditions. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke produce immense health and economic burdens in the United States and globally. The Update also presents the latest data on a range of major clinical heart and circulatory disease conditions (including stroke, congenital heart disease, rhythm disorders, subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease [CHD], heart failure [HF], valvular disease, venous disease, and peripheral artery disease) and the associated outcomes (including quality of care, procedures, and economic costs). Since 2007, the annual versions of the Statistical Update have been cited {\textgreater}20 000 times in the literature. From January to July 2017 alone, the 2017 Statistical Update was accessed {\textgreater}106 500 times. Each annual version of the Statistical Update undergoes revisions to include the newest nationally representative data, add additional relevant published scientific findings, remove older information, add new sections or chapters, and increase the number of ways to access and use the assembled information. This year-long process, which begins as soon as the previous Statistical Update is published, is performed by the AHA Statistics Committee faculty volunteers and staff and government agency partners. This year's edition includes new data on the monitoring and benefits of cardiovascular health in the population, new metrics to assess and monitor healthy diets, new information on stroke in young adults, an enhanced focus on underserved and minority populations, a substantively expanded focus on the global burden of CVD, and further evidence-based approaches to changing behaviors, implementation strategies, and implications of the AHA's 2020 Impact Goals.

We will review the genetics of arrhythmogenic hereditary syndromes with Mendelian inheritance from familial studies with structural heart disease (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy) as well as primary electrical causes (long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and short QT syndrome). In addition, we will review the genetics of intermediate phenotypes for SCD such as coronary artery disease and electrocardiographic variables (QT interval, QRS duration, and RR interval). Finally, we will review rare and common variants that are associated with SCD in the general population and were identified from candidate gene analyses and GWAS. Our understanding of the genetics of SCD will improve by the use of next-generation sequencing/whole-exome sequencing as well as whole-genome sequencing which have the potential to discover unsuspected common and rare genetic variants that might be associated with SCD.},

abstract = {The autonomic nervous system plays an important role in the modulation of cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmogenesis. Decades of research has contributed to a better understanding of the anatomy and physiology of cardiac autonomic nervous system and provided evidence supporting the relationship of autonomic tone to clinically significant arrhythmias. The mechanisms by which autonomic activation is arrhythmogenic or antiarrhythmic are complex and different for specific arrhythmias. In atrial fibrillation, simultaneous sympathetic and parasympathetic activations are the most common trigger. In contrast, in ventricular fibrillation in the setting of cardiac ischemia, sympathetic activation is proarrhythmic, whereas parasympathetic activation is antiarrhythmic. In inherited arrhythmia syndromes, sympathetic stimulation precipitates ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death except in Brugada and J-wave syndromes where it can prevent them. The identification of specific autonomic triggers in different arrhythmias has brought the idea of modulating autonomic activities for both preventing and treating these arrhythmias. This has been achieved by either neural ablation or stimulation. Neural modulation as a treatment for arrhythmias has been well established in certain diseases, such as long QT syndrome. However, in most other arrhythmia diseases, it is still an emerging modality and under investigation. Recent preliminary trials have yielded encouraging results. Further larger-scale clinical studies are necessary before widespread application can be recommended.},

Objectives This study assessed the predictive accuracy and improvement in reclassification gained by the addition of the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score, the ankle-brachial index (ABI), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels, and family history (FH) of ASCVD to the PCE in participants of MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis). Methods The PCE was calibrated (cPCE) and used for this analysis. The Cox proportional hazards survival model, Harrell's C statistics, and net reclassification improvement analyses were used. ASCVD was defined as myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease-related death, or fatal or nonfatal stroke. Results Of 6,814 MESA participants not prescribed statins at baseline, 5,185 had complete data and were included in this analysis. Their mean age was 61 years; 53.1{\%} were women, 9.8{\%} had diabetes, and 13.6{\%} were current smokers. After 10 years of follow-up, 320 (6.2{\%}) ASCVD events occurred. CAC score, ABI, and FH were independent predictors of ASCVD events in the multivariable Cox models. CAC score modestly improved the Harrell's C statistic (0.74 vs. 0.76; p = 0.04); ABI, hsCRP levels, and FH produced no improvement in Harrell's C statistic when added to the cPCE. Conclusions CAC score, ABI, and FH were independent predictors of ASCVD events. CAC score modestly improved the discriminative ability of the cPCE compared with other nontraditional risk markers.},

abstract = {Afferent and efferent cardiac neurotransmission via the cardiac nerves intricately modulates nearly all physiological functions of the heart (chronotropy, dromotropy, lusitropy, and inotropy). Afferent information from the heart is transmitted to higher levels of the nervous system for processing (intrinsic cardiac nervous system, extracardiac-intrathoracic ganglia, spinal cord, brain stem, and higher centers), which ultimately results in efferent cardiomotor neural impulses (via the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves). This system forms interacting feedback loops that provide physiological stability for maintaining normal rhythm and life-sustaining circulation. This system also ensures that there is fine-tuned regulation of sympatheticâparasympathetic balance in the heart under normal and stressed states in the short (beat to beat), intermediate (minutes to hours), and long term (days to years). This important neurovisceral/autonomic nervous system also plays a major role in the pathophysiology and progression of heart disease, including heart failure and arrhythmias leading to sudden cardiac death. Transdifferentiation of neurons in heart failure, functional denervation, cardiac and extracardiac neural remodeling has also been identified and characterized during the progression of disease. Recent advances in understanding the cellular and molecular processes governing innervation and the functional control of the myocardium in health and disease provide a rational mechanistic basis for the development of neuraxial therapies for preventing sudden cardiac death and other arrhythmias.

abstract = {Background: The associations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and coronary heart disease mortality in an exclusively low estimated 10-year risk group are not well delineated. We sought to determine the long-term associations of various LDL-C and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) thresholds and CVD and coronary heart disease mortality in a large, low 10-year risk cohort. Methods: The study sample included participants of the CCLS (Cooper Center Longitudinal Study) without a history of CVD or diabetes mellitus and defined as low risk ({\textless}7.5{\%}) for 10-year atherosclerotic CVD events at baseline based on Pooled Cohort Risk Assessment Equations. The associations of fasting LDL-C and non-HDL-C with CVD mortality were tested with Cox proportional hazards models. Results: In 36 375 participants (72{\%} men, median age 42) followed for a median of 26.8 years, 1086 CVD and 598 coronary heart disease deaths occurred. Compared with LDL-C {\textless}100 mg/dL, LDL-C categories 100 to 129 mg/dL, 130 to 159 mg/dL, 160 to 189.9 mg/dL, and â¥190 mg/dL were associated with a significantly higher risk of CVD death, with hazard ratios of 1.4 (95{\%} CI, 1.1-1.7), 1.3 (95{\%} CI, 1.1-1.6), 1.9 (95{\%} CI, 1.5-2.4), and 1.7 (95{\%} CI, 1.3-2.3), and mean reductions in years free of CVD death of 1.8, 1.1, 4.3, and 3.9, respectively. After adjustment for atherosclerotic CVD risk factors, LDL-C categories 160 to 189 mg/dL and â¥190 mg/dL remained independently associated with CVD mortality, with hazard ratios of 1.7 (95{\%} CI, 1.4-2.2) and 1.5 (95{\%} CI, 1.2-2.1), respectively. In multivariable-adjusted models using non-HDL-C {\textless}130 mg/dL as the reference, non-HDL-C 160 to 189 mg/dL, 190 to 219 mg/dL, and â¥220 mg/dL were significantly associated with CVD death, with hazard ratios of 1.3 (95{\%} CI, 1.1-1.6), 1.8 (95{\%} CI, 1.4-2.2), and 1.5 (95{\%} CI, 1.2-2.0), respectively. Restricting the cohort to those with 10-year risk {\textless}5{\%} did not diminish the associations of LDL-C and non-HDL-C with CVD mortality. Conclusions: In a low 10-year risk cohort with long-term follow-up, LDL-C and non-HDL-C â¥160 mg/dL were independently associated with a 50{\%} to 80{\%} increased relative risk of CVD mortality. These findings may have implications for future cholesterol treatment paradigms.},

abstract = {Background Detecting significant coronary artery disease (CAD) in the general population is complex and relies on combined assessment of traditional CAD risk factors and noninvasive testing. We hypothesized that a CAD-specific heart rate variability (HRV) algorithm can be used to improve detection of subclinical or early ischemia in patients without known CAD. Methods and Results Between 2014 and 2018 we prospectively enrolled 1043 patients with low to intermediate pretest probability for CAD who were screened for myocardial ischemia in tertiary medical centers in the United States and Israel. Patients underwent 1-hour Holter testing, with immediate HRV analysis using the HeartTrends DyDx algorithm, followed by exercise stress echocardiography (n=612) or exercise myocardial perfusion imaging (n=431). The threshold for low HRV was identified using receiver operating characteristic analysis based on sensitivity and specificity. The primary end point was the presence of myocardial ischemia detected by exercise stress echocardiography or exercise myocardial perfusion imaging. The mean age of patients was 61 years and 38{\%} were women. Myocardial ischemia was detected in 66 (6.3{\%}) patients. After adjustment for CAD risk factors and exercise stress testing results, low HRV was independently associated with a significant 2-fold increased likelihood for myocardial ischemia (odds ratio, 2.00; 95{\%} CI, 1.41-2.89 [P=0.01]). Adding HRV to traditional CAD risk factors significantly improved the pretest probability for myocardial ischemia. Conclusions Our data from a large prospective international clinical study show that short-term HRV testing can be used as a novel digital-health modality for enhanced risk assessment in low- to intermediate-risk individuals without known CAD.

@article{Lown1977,
abstract = {Brain stimulation can provoke a variety of arrhythmias and lower the ventricular vulnerable threshold. In the animal with acute myocardial ischemia such stimuli suffice to provoke ventricular fibrillation. Vagal neural traffic or adrenal catecholamines are not the conduits for this brain-heart linkage. Accompanying increases in heart rate or blood pressure are not prerequisites for the changes in cardiac excitability. Increased sympathetic activity, whether induced by neural or neurohumoral action, predisposes the heart to ventricular fibrillation. Protection can be achieved with surgical and pharmacologic denervation or reflex reduction in sympathetic tone. With acute myocardial ischemia, augmented sympathetic activity accounts for the early surge of ectopic activity frequently precipitating ventricular fibrillation. Asymmetries in sympathetic neural discharge may also contribute to the genesis of serious arrhythmias. The vagus nerve, through its muscarinic action, exerts an indirect effect on cardiac vulnerability, the consequence of annulment of concomitant adrenergic influence, rather than of any direct cholinergic action on the ventricles. There exist anatomic, physiologic as well as molecular bases for such interactions. Available experimental evidence indicates that environmental stresses of diverse types can injure the heart, lower the threshold of cardiac vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation and, in the animal with coronary occlusion, provoke potentially malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Available evidence indicates that in man, as in the experimental animal, administration of catecholamines can induce ventricular arrhythmia, whereas vagal activity exerts an opposite effect. Furthermore, in certain subjects diverse stresses and various psychologic states provoke ventricular ectopic activity. {\textcopyright} 1977 Dun {\textperiodcentered} Donnelley Publishing Corporation 666 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10019 All rights reserved.},

@article{Lown1979a,
abstract = {With the development of coronary care units in the 1960s, attitudes toward sudden cardiac death (SCD) began to change as physicians learned that cardiac arrest was reversible. The problem of SCD has two aspects an acute, precipitating factor and a chronic predisposition to electrical instability of the myocardium. Resolution of the problem requires identification and protection of the potential victim. Ven-tricular premature complexes (VPCs) have been related to the development of serious arrhythmias and early death, but the mere presence of VPCs does not discriminate risk of subsequent fatality. VPCs should be graded according to frequency, persistence, multiformity, repetitive pattern and degree of prematurity. Provocation of repetitive extrasystoles by R-on-T pacing may indicate the presence of a reduced threshold for ventricular fibrillation (VF). Prophylactic antiarrhythmic therapy may help protect patients resuscitated from VF against recurrent cardiac arrest. Neuropharmacologic factors perhaps affecting central nervous system sympathetic activity can alter cardiac vulnerability and may protect against VF. Findings in dogs indicate that psychologic stress can reduce the cardiac threshold for VF. If psychologic factors predispose to ventricular arrhythmias by increasing the level of sympathetic tone, lessening neural sympathetic activity should reduce the incidence of SCD. SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH (SCD) is one of the major challenges to contemporary cardiology. Its sheer magnitude demands attention, claiming over 400 thousand lives annually, or about 60{\%} of all coronary heart disease fatalities. The problem of sudden death has been recognized since the beginning of recorded history, yet before the 1960s, SCD received scant attention from clinical and research communities. In part this related to the prevailing perception that SCD was the ultimate expression of severe, far-advanced and irreversible coronary athero-sclerosis. Since the SCD was unexpected and struck down the seemingly healthy subject outside the hospital , the physician deemed it an act of fate before which he or she was largely helpless. As is often true in science, new methodologies not only usher in new content, but also mold new attitudes. In the case of SCD it was the burgeoning coronary care units (CCU) of the 1960s that stimulated a new direction. CCU experience largely dispelled the sense of futility, for it became rapidly evident that cardiac arrest was reversible. Patients promptly resuscitated from primary electrical failure consistently recovered and survived for variable and prolonged periods determined by the extent of their underlying heart disease. Because ventricular fibrilla-tion (VF) had its highest incidence at the beginning of a myocardial ischemic episode, it was logical to assume that this same mechanism accounted for out-of-hospital sudden death. The CCU demonstrated that VF can be reversed as well as prevented. These findings have led to the development of two distinct strategies:' 1) to reach the patient promptly and initiate effective cardio-pulmonary resuscitation,2 and 2) to identify the patient at increased risk for SCD and institute a prophylactic program against potentially fatal ven-tricular arrhythmias.3 Community Response to Cardiac Arrest The logic of a well-organized community program permitting immediate response to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is not debatable. The critical factor is the expeditious reaching of the victim by personnel fully tutored in basic life support. This necessarily requires that large sectors of the population be trained and their skill in cardiopulmonary resuscitation be finely honed at all times for the unexpected emergency. In Seattle, where such a program has been in operation for over 6 years, there have been 346 long-term survivors out of 1710 episodes of VF encountered in the community.4 The percentage of immediate resuscitations has improved annually, as has the yield in long-term survivors. A disquieting aspect of the Seat-tle experience is the high incidence of recurrent cardiac arrest. The mortality rate has been 26{\%} at 1 year and 36{\%} at two years. The problem of SCD has two aspects-an acute, precipitating trigger as well as a chronic predisposition to electrical instability of the myocardium. The mere reversal of the cardiac arrest does not obviate the underlying electrophysiologic abnormality. For those successfully resuscitated there can be no assurance that the good fortune of a prompt response by a trained medical team will be repeated. Resolution of the problem of SCD ultimately requires identification and protection of the potential victim. Detecting the Patient at Risk The essential strategy currently followed in identifying the patient at risk and in preventing VF relies on the hypothesis that the ventricular premature complex (VPC) constitutes a risk factor.1 3Two questions, therefore, must be answered: 1) What is the evidence that VPCs indeed indicate predisposition to sudden death? 2) Is there any basis for concluding that control of VPCs will protect against VF? 1593 by guest on May 12, 2016 http://circ.ahajournals.org/ Downloaded from},

abstract = {The heart rate response to vagal stimulation and the interaction with sympathetic activity was evaluated in conscious dogs at rest and during exercise; the latter was used as a tool to physiologically elevate sympathetic activity. In 20 dogs with a healed myocardial infarction and in 7 healthy dogs a bipolar electrode was chronically implanted around the right cervical vagus. Vagal stimulation (3 ms; 2.1 +/- 0.7 mA; 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 Hz) was performed while dogs stood on the treadmill (heart rate 120 +/- 25 beats/min) and while they exercised (201 +/- 17 beats/min). Gradual increases of the frequency of vagal stimulation gradually enhanced the inhibitory effect on heart rate both before and during exercise. During exercise, heart rate reduction was significantly greater than that produced at rest at any frequency of stimulation (P less than 0.001). This difference widened as the frequency of stimulation increased and the interaction with or without the presence of exercise was significant (P less than 0.02). Vagal stimulation produced similar effects in the seven dogs without myocardial infarction. These data demonstrate that the vagal-sympathetic "accentuated antagonism" described in anesthetized animals is also present in conscious dogs.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death among adults in the United States. Treatment to prevent CVD events by modifying risk factors is currently informed by the Framingham Risk Score, the Pooled Cohort Equations, or similar CVD risk assessment models. If current CVD risk assessment models could be improved by adding more risk factors, treatment might be better targeted, thereby maximizing the benefits and minimizing the harms. OBJECTIVE To update the 2009 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on using nontraditional risk factors in coronary heart disease risk assessment. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on using nontraditional risk factors in CVD risk assessment, focusing on the ankle-brachial index (ABI), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level, and coronary artery calcium (CAC) score; the health benefits and harms of CVD risk assessment and treatment guided by nontraditional risk factors combined with the Framingham Risk Score or Pooled Cohort Equations compared with using either risk assessment model alone; and whether adding nontraditional risk factors to existing CVD risk assessment models improves measures of calibration, discrimination, and risk reclassification. FINDINGS The USPSTF found adequate evidence that adding the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score to existing CVD risk assessment models results in small improvements in discrimination and risk reclassification; however, the clinical meaning of these changes is largely unknown. Evidence on adding the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score to the Pooled Cohort Equations is limited. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess whether treatment decisions guided by the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score, in addition to risk factors in existing CVD risk assessment models, leads to reduced incidence of CVD events or mortality. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to conceptually bound the harms of early detection and interventions as small. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of using the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score in risk assessment for CVD in asymptomatic adults to prevent CVD events. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of adding the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score to traditional risk assessment for CVD in asymptomatic adults to prevent CVD events.},

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic yield of a novel short-term HRV algorithm for the detection of myocardial ischemia in subjects without known CAD. We prospectively enrolled 450 subjects without known CAD who were referred to tertiary medical centers for exercise stress testing (EST) with single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). All subjects underwent 1-hour Holter testing with subsequent HRV analysis before EST with MPI. The diagnostic yield of HRV analysis was compared with EST, using MPI as the gold standard for the noninvasive detection of myocardial ischemia. All subjects had intermediate pretest probability for CAD. Mean age was 62 years, 38{\%} were women, 51{\%} had hypertension, and 25{\%} diabetes mellitus. HRV analysis showed superior sensitivity (77{\%}) compared with standard EST (27{\%}). After multivariate adjustment, HRV was independently associated with an 8.4-fold (p {\textless}0.001) increased likelihood for the detection of myocardial ischemia by MPI, whereas EST did not show a statistically significant association with a positive MPI (odds ratio 2.1; p = 0.12). Of subjects who were referred for subsequent coronary angiography, the respective sensitivities of HRV and EST for the detection of significant CAD were 73{\%} versus 26{\%}. Our data suggest that HRV can be used as an important noninvasive technique for the detection of myocardial ischemia in subjects without known CAD, providing superior sensitivity to conventional EST in this population.},

abstract = {AIMS: Dyx is a new heart rate variability (HRV) density analysis specifically designed to identify patients at high risk for malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The aim of this study was to test if Dyx can improve risk stratification for malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias and to test if the previously identified cut-off can be reproduced. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 248 patients from the CARISMA study with ejection fraction â¤40{\%} after an acute myocardial infarction and an analysable 24 h Holter recording. All patients received an implantable cardiac monitor, which was used to diagnose the primary endpoint of near-fatal or fatal ventricular tachyarrhythmias likely preventable by an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), during a period of 2 years. A Dyx â¤ 1.96 was considered abnormal. The secondary endpoint was cardiovascular death. At enrolment 59 patients (24{\%}) had a Dyx â¤ 1.96 and 20 experienced a primary endpoint. A Dyx â¤ 1.96 was associated with a significantly increased risk for malignant arrhythmias [hazards ratio (HR) = 4.36 (1.81â10.52), P = 0.001] and cardiovascular death [HR = 3.47 (1.38â8.74), P = 0.008]. Compared with important clinical risk parameters (age {\textgreater}70 years and QRS {\textgreater} 120 ms), Dyx â¤ 1.96 significantly added predictive value (P = 0.0066). CONCLUSIONS: Dyx was a better predictor of ventricular tachyarrhythmias than the traditional measures of HRV and heart rate turbulence, particularly in the elderly. Dyx might be a useful tool for better selection of ICD candidates in the elderly population, since a normal Dyx in this group was associated with a very low risk for malignant ventricular arrhythmias.

Heart block occurred in 19 patients, and 17 were successfully treated. The actuarial five-year mortality from an event that could conceivably have been a bradyarrhythmia was 6 per cent (35 per cent from all causes). Of the 160 deaths, 67 (42 per cent) were sudden; most of these were not ascribable to bradyarrhythmia but to tachyarrhythmia and myocardial infarction.

abstract = {Background: Clinical features from electronic health records (EHRs) can be used to build a complementary tool to predict coronary artery disease (CAD) susceptibility. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine whether an EHR score can improve CAD prediction and reclassification 1 year before diagnosis, beyond conventional clinical guidelines as determined by the pooled cohort equations (PCE) and a polygenic risk score for CAD. Methods: We applied a machine learning framework using clinical features from the EHR in a multiethnic, clinical care cohort (BioMe) comprising 555 CAD cases and 6,349 control subjects and in a population-based cohort (UK Biobank) comprising 3,130 CAD cases and 378,344 control subjects for external validation. Results: Compared with the PCE, the EHR score improved CAD prediction by 12{\%} in the BioMe Biobank and by 9{\%} in the UK Biobank. The EHR score reclassified 25.8{\%} and 15.2{\%} individuals in each cohort respectively, compared with the PCE score. We observed larger improvements in the EHR score over the PCE in a subgroup of individuals with low CAD risk, with 20{\%} increased discrimination and 34.4{\%} increased reclassification. In all models, the polygenic risk score for CAD did not improve CAD prediction, compared with the PCE or EHR score. Conclusions: The EHR score resulted in increased prediction and reclassification for CAD, demonstrating its potential use for population health monitoring of short-term CAD risk in large health systems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis has been shown to be a predictor of sudden cardiac death and all-cause mortality in patients with cardiac disease. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether newer HRV analysis algorithms, as used by the HeartTrends device, are superior to exercise stress testing (EST) for the detection of myocardial ischemia in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: We present pilot data of the first 100 subjects enrolled in a clinical trial designed to evaluate the yield of short-term (1 hour) HRV testing for the detection of myocardial ischemia. The study population comprised subjects without known CAD referred to a tertiary medical center for EST with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). All patients underwent a 1 hour electrocardiographic acquisition for HRV analysis with a HeartTrends device prior to ESTwith MPI. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) were calculated for EST and HRV analysis, using MPI as the gold standard for the non-invasive detection of myocardial ischemia. RESULTS: In this cohort 15{\%} had a pathologic MPI result. HRV analysis showed superior sensitivity (85{\%}), PPV (50{\%}) and NPV (97{\%}) as compared to standard EST (53{\%}, 42{\%}, 90{\%}, respectively), while the specificity of the two tests was similar (86{\%} and 85{\%}, respectively). The close agreement between HRV and MPI was even more pronounced among patients {\textgreater} 65 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot data suggest that the diagnostic yield of the novel HeartTrends HRV algorithm is superior to conventional EST for the non-invasive detection of myocardial ischemia.},

abstract = {AIMS Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is typically provoked by negative stressors such as grief, anger, or fear leading to the popular term 'broken heart syndrome'. However, the role of positive emotions triggering TTS remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to analyse the prevalence and characteristics of patients with TTS following pleasant events, which are distinct from the stressful or undesirable episodes commonly triggering TTS. METHODS AND RESULTS Takotsubo syndrome patients with preceding pleasant events were compared to those with negative emotional triggers from the International Takotsubo Registry. Of 1750 TTS patients, we identified a total of 485 with a definite emotional trigger. Of these, 4.1{\%} (n = 20) presented with pleasant preceding events and 95.9{\%} (n = 465) with unequivocal negative emotional events associated with TTS. Interestingly, clinical presentation of patients with 'happy heart syndrome' was similar to those with the 'broken heart syndrome' including symptoms such as chest pain [89.5{\%} (17/19) vs. 90.2{\%} (412/457), P = 1.0]. Similarly, electrocardiographic parameters, laboratory findings, and 1-year outcome did not differ. However, in a post hoc analysis, a disproportionate higher prevalence of midventricular involvement was noted in 'happy hearts' compared with 'broken hearts' (35.0 vs. 16.3{\%}, P = 0.030). CONCLUSION Our data illustrate that TTS can be triggered by not only negative but also positive life events. While patient characteristics were similar between groups, the midventricular TTS type was more prevalent among the 'happy hearts' than among the 'broken hearts'. Presumably, despite their distinct nature, happy and sad life events may share similar final common emotional pathways, which can ultimately trigger TTS.},

abstract = {Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are associated with cardiac fibrosis that may reduce myocardial compliance, contribute to the pathogenesis of heart failure, and trigger arrhythmic events. Diabetes-associated fibrosis is mediated by activated cardiac fibroblasts, but may also involve fibrogenic actions of macrophages, cardiomyocytes and vascular cells. The molecular basis responsible for cardiac fibrosis in diabetes remains poorly understood. Hyperglycemia directly activates a fibrogenic program, leading to accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) that crosslink extracellular matrix proteins, and transduce fibrogenic signals through reactive oxygen species generation, or through activation of Receptor for AGEs (RAGE)-mediated pathways. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines may recruit fibrogenic leukocyte subsets in the cardiac interstitium. Activation of transforming growth factor-$\beta$/Smad signaling may activate fibroblasts inducing deposition of structural extracellular matrix proteins and matricellular macromolecules. Adipokines, endothelin-1 and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system have also been implicated in the diabetic myocardium. This manuscript reviews our current understanding of the cellular effectors and molecular pathways that mediate fibrosis in diabetes. Based on the pathophysiologic mechanism, we propose therapeutic interventions that may attenuate the diabetes-associated fibrotic response and discuss the challenges that may hamper clinical translation.},

We have for 8 years followed 260 apparently healthy adult subjects who underwent Holter monitoring. Twelve died, 14 developed ischaemic heart disease and four suffered sudden cardiac death. A healthy control subject was matched, along with other risk factors, for each case. In each subject 24-h heart rate variability was calculated as the deviation of all normal R-R intervals from mean R-R (SD) and the percentage of successive R-R interval differences exceeding 6{\%} ({\%}DIF6{\%})--this was used as an index of cardiac parasympathetic activity. There were no significant differences in heart rate variability between the cases developing problems and controls. In the sudden cardiac death victims, however, there was a clear trend towards lower heart rate variability. In them waketime mean SD was 73 ms versus 85 ms for cases and controls respectively (p = 0.08), and for sleeptime 61 ms versus 76 ms (p = 0.07). Compared to normal limits for heart rate variability obtained in 140 subjects that remained healthy for 8 years, figures for both SD and {\%}DIF6{\%} in sudden cardiac death subjects were at or below 95{\%} confidence limits. The results indicate that altered autonomic balance may contribute to sudden cardiac death even in apparently healthy subjects. Subjects with a low 24-h heart rate variability on Holter monitoring may be predicted at an early stage of being at greater risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Effective risk stratification to identify patients at risk of arrhythmic SCD is essential for targeting our healthcare and research resources to tackle this important public health issue. Although our understanding of SCD because of pulseless electric activity/asystole is growing, the overwhelming majority of research in risk stratification has focused on SCD-ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation. This review focuses on existing and novel risk stratification tools for SCD-ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation. For patients with left ventricular dysfunction or myocardial infarction, advances in imaging, measures of cardiac autonomic function, and measures of repolarization have shown considerable promise in refining risk. Yet the majority of SCD-ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation occurs in patients without known cardiac disease. Biomarkers and novel imaging techniques may provide further risk stratification in the general population beyond traditional risk stratification for coronary artery disease alone. Despite these advances, significant challenges in risk stratification remain that must be overcome before a meaningful impact on SCD can be realized.},

abstract = {The intrinsic cardiac nervous system has been classically considered to contain only parasympathetic efferent postganglionic neurones which receive inputs from medullary parasympathetic efferent preganglionic neurones. In such a view, intrinsic cardiac ganglia act as simple relay stations of parasympathetic efferent neuronal input to the heart, the major autonomic control of the heart purported to reside solely in the brainstem and spinal cord. Data collected over the past two decades indicate that processing occurs within the mammalian intrinsic cardiac nervous system which involves afferent neurones, local circuit neurones (interconnecting neurones) as well as both sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent postganglionic neurones. As such, intrinsic cardiac ganglionic interactions represent the organ component of the hierarchy of intrathoracic nested feedback control loops which provide rapid and appropriate reflex coordination of efferent autonomic neuronal outflow to the heart. In such a concept, the intrinsic cardiac nervous system acts as a distributive processor, integrating parasympathetic and sympathetic efferent centrifugal information to the heart in addition to centripetal information arising from cardiac sensory neurites. A number of neurochemicals have been shown to influence the interneuronal interactions which occur within the intrathoracic cardiac nervous system. For instance, pharmacological interventions that modify b-adrenergic or angiotensin II receptors affect cardiomyocyte function not only directly, but indirectly by influencing the capacity of intrathoracic neurones to regulate cardiomyocytes. Thus, current pharmacological management of heart disease may influence cardiomyocyte function directly as well as indirectly secondary to modifying the cardiac nervous system. This review presents a brief summary of developing concepts about the role of the cardiac nervous system in regulating the normal heart. In addition, it provides some tentative ideas concerning the importance of this nervous system in cardiac disease states with a view to stimulating further interest in neural control of the heart so that appropriate neurocardiological strategies can be devised for the management of heart disease.},

Genetic association analyses showed that the presence of common 4q25 risk alleles predicted whether carriers of rare mutations developed AF (p = 2.2 Ã 10-4). Conclusions: Common AF-associated 4q25 polymorphisms modify the clinical expression of latent cardiac ion channel and signaling molecule gene mutations associated with familial AF. These findings support the idea that the genetic architecture of AF is complex and includes both rare and common genetic variants. {\textcopyright} 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {The intravenous infusion of adenosine provokes anginalike chest pain. To establish its origin, an intracoronary infusion of increasing adenosine concentrations was given in 22 patients with stable angina pectoris. During adenosine infusion, 20 patients had chest pain without electrocardiographic signs of ischemia. They all reported that the chest pain was similar to their usual anginal pain. In 10 of the 22 patients adenosine was also infused into the right atrium, but it never produced symptoms at the doses that had provoked chest pain during intracoronary infusion. In seven other patients, the intracoronary adenosine infusion was repeated after intravenous administration of aminophylline, an antagonist of adenosine P1-receptors. Aminophylline decreased the severity of adenosine-induced chest pain (assessed with a visual analog scale) from 42 +/- 22 to 23 +/- 17 mm (p less than 0.002). In the remaining five of the 22 patients, monitoring of blood oxygen saturation in the coronary sinus during intracoronary adenosine administration showed that maximum coronary vasodilation was achieved at doses lower than those responsible for chest pain. A single-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of the effect of aminophylline on exercise-induced chest pain was also performed in 20 other patients with stable angina. Aminophylline, compared with placebo, decreased the severity of chest pain at peak exercise from 67 +/- 21 to 51 +/- 23 mm (p less than 0.02), despite the achievement of a similar degree of ST-segment depression. Finally, the effect of intravenous adenosine was compared in 10 patients with predominantly painful myocardial ischemia and in 10 patients with predominantly silent ischemia.},

Atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS) has been studied in connection with AS, but its risk factors and progression have not been clarified. Therefore, this study assessed the prevalence and risk factors of AAS in patients with AS. Methods. A total of 819 patients with AS who fulfilled the modified New York criteria and were examined with a full-flexion lateral view of the cervical spine by radiograph were enrolled from an outpatient clinic. The medical records of the patients were retrospectively reviewed and the anterior atlantodental interval (AADI) in the lateral flexion view of the cervical spine radiograph was investigated by 2 experienced musculoskeletal radiologists. We defined the AAS as an AADI of {\textgreater} 3 mm, and progression of AADI as a progression rate {\textgreater} 0.5 mm/year. Results. AAS was found in 14.1{\%} (116/819) of patients. Progression of AADI occurred in 32.1{\%} (26/81) patients with AAS and 5.0{\%} (16/320) patients without AAS (p {\textless} 0.001). The development of AAS was significantly associated with elevated C-reactive protein [CRP; OR 2.19 (1.36-3.53)], peripheral arthritis [OR 2.05 (1.36-3.07)], use of anti-tumor necrosis factor antagonists because of failure of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs/disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs [NSAID/DMARD; OR 2.28 (1.52-3.42)], and uveitis [OR 1.71 (1.13-2.59)]. These factors were adjusted for age, sex, and disease duration by logistic regression analysis. No clear association was found for HLA-B27, seropositivity, or smoking status with AAS. Conclusion. AAS is a frequent complication, and the progression of AADI was more rapid in cases with AAS. The presence of peripheral arthritis, or high disease activity with elevated CRP level or refractory to conventional NSAID/DMARD, independently increased the risk of AAS, suggesting that clinicians should focus on the detection and monitoring of AAS, especially in cases with associated risk factors.

abstract = {Objectives: This study tested the hypothesis that response to antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) is modulated by 3 common loci associated with atrial fibrillation (AF). Background: Recent genome-wide association studies have identified 3 loci, on chromosomes 4q25 (near PITX2), 16q22 (in ZFHX3), and 1q21 (in KCNN3), that associate with either typical or lone AF. These findings indicate that variable mechanisms contribute to AF susceptibility, and suggest that response to therapy may be genotype dependent. Methods: We studied 478 and 198 Caucasian patients in the discovery cohort and validation cohort, respectively, who were prospectively enrolled in the Vanderbilt AF registry. Response was defined prospectively as successful rhythm control if the patient remained on the same AAD therapy for a minimum of 6 months with {\textless}75{\%} reduction in symptomatic AF burden. We also evaluated AF recurrence by 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at 3, 6, and 12 months. Symptomatic patients were also given a 24- to 48-h Holter monitor or 30-day event recorder when AF recurrence was not captured by 12-lead ECG. Results: In the discovery cohort, 399 (83{\%}) patients were successfully rhythm controlled. Multiple clinical variables (including age, hypertension, lone AF) failed to significantly predict response to AADs; however, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs10033464 at 4q25 was an independent predictor of successful rhythm control in patients with typical AF carrying the ancestral allele (wild type) versus carriers of variant allele (odds ratio [OR]: 4.7, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 1.83 to 12, p = 0.0013. In the validation cohort, 143 (72{\%}) patients met the criteria for successful rhythm control, and rs10033464 was again an independent predictor of successful rhythm control, OR: 1.5, 95{\%} CI: 1.02 to 3.06, p = 0.04. This SNP (rs10033464) was an independent predictor of AF recurrence in the discovery (39{\%} AF recurrence) and validation (38{\%} AF recurrence) cohorts; OR: 3.27, 95{\%} CI: 1.7 to 6, p {\textless} 0.001 and OR: 4.3, 95{\%} CI: 1.98 to 9.4, p {\textless} 0.001, respectively. Conclusions: These results suggest that a common SNP on chromosome 4q25 associated with AF modulates response to AAD therapy and points to a potential role for stratification of therapeutic approaches by genotype. {\textcopyright} 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {In the industrially developed countries, sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of death. It was recognized at the dawn of recorded history and even depicted in Egyptian relief sculpture from the tomb of a noble of the Sixth dynasty approximately 4,500 years ago. Sudden cardiac death has left no age untouched. Sparing neither saint nor sinner, it has burdened man with a sense of uncertainty and fragility. The enormity of this problem demands attention. In the United States, sudden cardiac death claims about 1,200 lives daily, or approximately one victim every minute. It is the leading cause of death among men aged 20 to 64 years, accounting for 32 percent of the fatalities in this group. Nearly 25 percent of persons dying suddenly have had no prior recognized symptoms of heart disease.The excess of widows observed in retirement communities is accounted for by the three- to fourfold greater incidence of sudden cardiac death among men. Sudden death in old age might be a blessing rather than a scourge, but instead it frequently explodes a man's life at its prime, at a median age of only 59 years. The medical profession has sensed the issue but has largely ignored sudden death as a problem amenable to solution. This indifference has not been the result of a lack of interest or concern but a reflection of the belief that sudden cardiac death was the inevitable culmination of coronary atherosclerosis. Because sudden death was unpredictable and afflicted the apparently healthy subject outside the hospital, the physician considered it an act of fate before which he was largely helpless. The advent of the coronary care unit has promoted a reassessment of this complex problem. It has become clear that sudden death is not the inexorable culmination of advanced coronary atherosclerosis but instead is the result of ventricular fibrillation and therefore is readily reversible.7,8If ventricular fibrillation were only the consequence of severe coronary atherosclerosis, once reversed it would promptly recur. However, patients treated for ventricular fibrillation seldom have recurring episodes, and they usually recover and survive for long periods.9,10The new concept that ventricular fibrillation is an electrical accident suggests that its cause is not anatomic and thereby contributes to the growing interest in redefining the basis for sudden death and developing methods for its containment. Until recently our inability to deal with sudden cardiac death has not been due to a gap in the application of knowledge but to a gap in knowledge itself. The purpose of this review is to indicate how much we know and to sketch the path of possible further progress. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

abstract = {Objectives: This study sought to examine the relationship between inflammation and coronary microvascular function in asymptomatic individuals using positron emission tomography (PET) and assessment of coronary flow reserve (CFR). Background: Coronary microvascular dysfunction is an early precursor of coronary artery disease (CAD) thought to result from endothelial cell activation and inflammation, but data are limited. Methods: We examined 268 asymptomatic male monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Plasma biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial cell activation included C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, white blood cell count (WBC), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. Blood flow quantitation was obtained with [13N] ammonia PET at rest and after adenosine stress. CFR was measured as the ratio of maximum flow to baseline flow at rest; abnormal CFR was defined as a ratio {\textless}2.5. A summed stress score for visible perfusion defects was calculated. Results: In within-pair analyses, all biomarkers, except VCAM-1, were higher in twins with lower CFR than their brothers with higher CFR (p {\textless} 0.05). This was observed in the entire sample, as well as within pairs discordant for a CFR of {\textless}2.5. Associations persisted after adjusting for summed stress score and CAD risk factors. In contrast no biomarker, except IL-6, was related to the summed stress score of visible defects. Conclusions: Even in asymptomatic subjects, a decrease in coronary microvascular function is accompanied by a systemic inflammatory response, independent of CAD risk factors. Our results, using a controlled twin design, highlight the importance of coronary microvascular function in the early phases of CAD. {\textcopyright} 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {Worldwide, sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a major problem. It is most frequently caused by ventricular tachyarrhythmias: Monomorphic and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), torsade de pointes (TdP), and ventricular fibrillation (VF). Beta blockade, ACE inhibition, coronary reperfusion and other treatments have reduced the incidence of VT but pulseless electrical activity (PEA) is increasingly seen, particularly in patients with advanced chronic heart disease. From existing data, bradyarrhythmia in the form of asystole (usually complete heart block without escape rhythm) causes only a minor proportion (10-15{\%}) of SCD. In patients aged 50 years and more, coronary artery disease plays a dominant role causing more than 75{\%} of SCD cases, either by acute ischemia and ventricular fibrillation or by chronic scar formation and reentrant VT. In younger patients, SCD may occur in patients with structurally normal hearts. A number of arrhythmogenic disorders with an increased risk of SCD have been detected and better understood recently, such as long and short QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and the early repolarization syndrome. Most importantly, ECG signs and clinical features indicating high risk for SCD have been identified. Knowledge of the exact electrophysiologic mechanisms of ventricular tachyarrhythmias at the cellular level has been improved and mechanisms such as phase 2 reentry and reflection proposed to better understand why and how SCD occurs. {\textcopyright} 2014, Cardiological Society of India.

Primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death require understanding of the underlying substrate causing ventricular arrhythmias and its modification by pharmacological (i.e. heart failure therapy) or interventional (catheter ablation) methods. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy has experienced ups and downs during the last 30 years balancing high antiarrhythmic potential, toxic side effects and pro-arrhythmic potency. Therefore, the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) remains irreplaceable in primary and secondary prevention of SCD. Hybrid therapy combing antiarrhythmic drugs (predominantly amiodarone) with ICD therapy represents an often-used treatment option. This short review provides an overview of current pharmacological therapy aiming to prevent SCD.},

abstract = {Importance Patients with early-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) are enriched for rare variants in cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia genes. The clinical significance of these rare variants in patients with early-onset AF is unknown. Objective To assess the association between rare variants in cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia genes detected in patients with early-onset AF and time to death. Design, Setting, and Participants This prospective cohort study included participants with AF diagnosed before 66 years of age who underwent whole-genome sequencing through the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine program. Participants were enrolled from November 23, 1999, to June 2, 2015. Data were analyzed from February 26 to September 19, 2021. Exposures Rare variants identified in a panel of 145 genes that are included in cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia panels used by commercial clinical genetic testing laboratories. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary study outcome was time to death and was adjudicated from medical records and the National Death Index. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate the association of disease-associated variants with risk of death after adjustment for age at AF diagnosis, sex, race, body mass index, left ventricular ejection fraction, and an interaction term of age at AF diagnosis and disease-associated variant status. Results Among 1293 participants (934 [72{\%}] male; median age at enrollment, 56.0 years; IQR, 48.0-61.0 years), disease-associated (pathogenic or likely pathogenic) rare variants were found in 131 (10{\%}). During a median follow-up of 9.9 years (IQR, 6.9-13.2 years), 219 participants (17{\%}) died. In univariable analysis, disease-associated variants were associated with an increased risk of mortality (hazard ratio, [HR], 1.5; 95{\%} CI, 1.0-2.1;P = .05); the association remained significant in multivariable modeling when adjusted for age at AF diagnosis, sex, race, body mass index, left ventricular ejection fraction, and an interaction term between disease-associated variant status and age at AF diagnosis. The interaction demonstrated that disease-associated variants were associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality compared with no disease-associated variant when AF was diagnosed at a younger age (P = .008 for interaction). Higher body mass index (per IQR: HR, 1.4; 95{\%} CI, 1.2-1.6;P {\textless} .001) and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (per IQR: HR, 0.8; 95{\%} CI, 0.7-0.8;P {\textless} .001) were associated with higher mortality risk. There were 73 cardiomyopathy-related deaths, 40 sudden deaths, and 10 stroke-related deaths. Mortality among patients with the most prevalent genes with disease-associated variants was 26{\%} (10 of 38 patients) forTTN, 33{\%} (6 of 18) forMYH7, 22{\%} (2 of 9) forLMNA, 0{\%} (0 of 10) forMYH6, and 0{\%} (0 of 8) forKCNQ1. Conclusions and Relevance The findings suggest that rare variants in cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia genes may be associated with increased risk of mortality among patients with early-onset AF, especially those diagnosed at a younger age. Genetic testing may provide important prognostic information for patients with early-onset AF.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Observational studies have suggested that psychological stress increases the incidence of sudden cardiac death. Whether emotional or physical stressors can trigger spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias in patients at risk has not been systematically evaluated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) were given diaries to record levels of defined mood states and physical activity, using a 5-point intensity scale, during 2 periods preceding spontaneously occurring ICD shocks (0 to 15 minutes and 15 minutes to 2 hours) and during control periods 1 week later. ICD-stored electrograms confirmed the rhythm at the time of shock. A total of 107 confirmed ventricular arrhythmias requiring shock were reported by 42 patients (33 men; mean age, 65 years; 78{\%} had coronary artery disease) between August 1996 and September 1999. In the 15 minutes preceding shock, an anger level {\textgreater} or =3 preceded 15{\%} of events compared with 3{\%} of control periods (P{\textless}0.04; odds ratio, 1.83; 95{\%} confidence intervals, 1.04 to 3.16) Other mood states (anxiety, worry, sadness, happiness, challenge, feeling in control, or interest) did not differ. Patients were more physically active preceding shock than in control periods. Anger and physical activity were independently associated with the preshock period. CONCLUSIONS: Anger and physical activity can trigger ventricular arrhythmias in patients with ICDs. Future investigations of therapies aimed at blocking a response to these stressors may decrease ventricular arrhythmias and shocks in these patients.},

Therefore, the effect of such factors on risk of coronary heart disease in most regions of the world is unknown. Methods We established a standardised case-control study of acute myocardial infarction in 52 countries, representing every inhabited continent. 15 152 cases and 14 820 controls were enrolled. The relation of smoking, history of hypertension or diabetes, waist/hip ratio, dietary patterns, physical activity, consumption of alcohol, blood apolipoproteins (Apo), and psychosocial factors to myocardial infarction are reported here. Odds ratios and their 99{\%} CIs for the association of risk factors to myocardial infarction and their population attributable risks (PAR) were calculated. Findings Smoking (odds ratio 2{\textperiodcentered}87 for current vs never, PAR 35{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} for current and former vs never), raised ApoB/ApoA1 ratio (3{\textperiodcentered}25 for top vs lowest quintile, PAR 49{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} for top four quintiles vs lowest quintile), history of hypertension (1{\textperiodcentered}91, PAR 17{\textperiodcentered}9{\%}), diabetes (2{\textperiodcentered}37, PAR 9{\textperiodcentered}9{\%}), abdominal obesity (1{\textperiodcentered}12 for top vs lowest tertile and 1{\textperiodcentered}62 for middle vs lowest tertile, PAR 20{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} for top two tertiles vs lowest tertile), psychosocial factors (2{\textperiodcentered}67, PAR 32{\textperiodcentered}5{\%}), daily consumption of fruits and vegetables (0{\textperiodcentered}70, PAR 13{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} for lack of daily consumption), regular alcohol consumption (0{\textperiodcentered}91, PAR 6{\textperiodcentered}7{\%}), and regular physical activity (0{\textperiodcentered}86, PAR 12{\textperiodcentered}2{\%}), were all significantly related to acute myocardial infarction (p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001 for all risk factors and p=0{\textperiodcentered}03 for alcohol). These associations were noted in men and women, old and young, and in all regions of the world. Collectively, these nine risk factors accounted for 90{\%} of the PAR in men and 94{\%} in women. Interpretation Abnormal lipids, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, abdominal obesity, psychosocial factors, consumption of fruits, vegetables, and alcohol, and regular physical activity account for most of the risk of myocardial infarction worldwide in both sexes and at all ages in all regions. This finding suggests that approaches to prevention can be based on similar principles worldwide and have the potential to prevent most premature cases of myocardial infarction.},

abstract = {Sudden death is frequently of cardiac origin, and its most common electrophysiologic mechanism is ventricular fibrillation. The concept that sudden death in human beings is due to ventricular fibrillation was first proposed by MacWilliam exactly 100 years ago, well before the electrocardiogram was invented. To conduct his experimental work, MacWilliam devised methods that laid the foundations for modern cardiac research and that provided the first comprehensive approach to successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. He recognized the role of the autonomic nervous system in modulating both the mechanical and the electrical properties of the heart, and was the first to suggest that this effect had a role in the genesis of sudden death. On the centennial of his theory of sudden death, MacWilliam's concepts are reviewed in the context of the effect of Darwinian influence on British physiology. It is suggested that his theorem was based on both sound experimental data and comparative physiology, drawing on the new evolutionary principle of similar structure and function in the hearts of various species. MacWilliam's basic physiologic concepts have survived intact for a century, greatly influencing more than three generations of research and practice in clinical cardiology. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {Background: Prior studies have consistently demonstrated that blacks have an approximate 2-fold higher incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) than whites; however, these analyses have lacked individual-level sociodemographic, medical comorbidity, and behavioral health data. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether racial differences in SCD incidence are attributable to differences in the prevalence of risk factors or rather to underlying susceptibility to fatal arrhythmias. Methods: The Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study is a prospective, population-based cohort of adults from across the United States. Associations between race and SCD defined per National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute criteria were assessed. Results: Among 22,507 participants (9,416 blacks and 13,091 whites) without a history of clinical cardiovascular disease, there were 174 SCD events (67 whites and 107 blacks) over a median follow-up of 6.1 years (interquartile range: 4.6 to 7.3 years). The age-adjusted SCD incidence rate (per 1,000 person-years) was higher in blacks (1.8; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 1.4 to 2.2) compared with whites (0.7; 95{\%} CI: 0.6 to 0.9), with an unadjusted hazard ratio of 2.35; 95{\%} CI: 1.74 to 3.20. The association of black race with SCD risk remained significant after adjustment for sociodemographics, comorbidities, behavioral measures of health, intervening cardiovascular events, and competing risks of non-SCD mortality (hazard ratio: 1.97; 95{\%} CI: 1.39 to 2.77). Conclusions: In a large biracial population of adults without a history of cardiovascular disease, SCD rates were significantly higher in blacks as compared with whites. These racial differences were not fully explained by demographics, adverse socioeconomic measures, cardiovascular risk factors, and behavioral measures of health.},

Better understanding of the potentially lethal life situations and identification of individuals at risk may lead to the development of practical prophylactic measures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Left ventricular (LV) diameter is routinely measured on the echocardiogram but has not been jointly evaluated with the ejection fraction (EF) for risk stratification of sudden cardiac death (SCD). METHODS AND RESULTS: From a large ongoing community-based study of SCD (The Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study; population approximately 1 million), SCD cases were compared with geographic controls. LVEF and LV diameter, measured using the LV internal dimension in diastole (categorized as normal, mild, moderate, or severe dilatation using American Society of Echocardiography definitions) were assessed from echocardiograms prior but unrelated to the SCD event. Cases (n=418; 69.5+/-13.8 years), compared with controls (n=329; 67.7+/-11.9 years), more commonly had severe LV dysfunction (EF {\textless}/=35{\%}; 30.5{\%} versus 18.8{\%}; P{\textless}0.01) and larger LV diameter (52.2+/-10.5 mm versus 49.7+/-7.9 mm; P{\textless}0.01). Moderate or severe LV dilatation (16.3{\%} versus 8.2{\%}; P=0.001) and severe LV dilatation (8.1{\%} versus 2.1{\%}; P{\textless}0.001) were significantly more frequent in cases. In multivariable analysis, severe LV dilatation was an independent predictor of SCD (odds ratio 2.5 [95{\%} CI 1.03 to 5.9]; P=0.04). In addition, subjects with both EF {\textless}/=35{\%} and severe LV dilatation had higher odds for SCD compared with those with low EF only (odds ratio 3.8 [95{\%} CI 1.5 to 10.2] for both versus 1.7 [95{\%} CI 1.2 to 2.5] for low EF only), suggesting that severe LV dilatation additively increased SCD risk. CONCLUSION: LV diameter may contribute to risk stratification for SCD independent of the LVEF. This readily available echocardiographic measure warrants further prospective evaluation.},

abstract = {Diabetes has emerged as a major threat to worldwide health. The increasing incidence of diabetes in young individuals is particularly worrisome given that the disease is likely to evolve over a period of years. In 1972, the existence of a diabetic cardiomyopathy was proposed based on the experience with four adult diabetic patients who suffered from congestive heart failure in the absence of discernible coronary artery disease, valvular or congenital heart disease, hypertension, or alcoholism. The exact mechanisms underlying the disease are unknown; however, an important component of the pathological alterations observed in these hearts includes the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, in particular collagens. The excess deposition of ECM in the heart mirrors what occurs in other organs such as the kidney and peritoneum of diabetics. Mechanisms responsible for these alterations may include the excess production, reduced degradation, and/or chemical modification of ECM proteins. These effects may be the result of direct or indirect actions of high glucose concentrations. This article reviews our state of knowledge on the effects that diabetes-like conditions exert on the cells responsible for ECM production as well as relevant experimental and clinical data. {\textcopyright} 2006 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

Animal models are limited by their degree of homology to human cardiac electrophysiology, including ion channel expression. Most commonly used cellular models are cellular transfection models, which are able to mimic the expression of a single-ion channel offering incomplete insight into changes of the action potential profile.

A variety of platforms exist to phenotype cellular models, including conventional and automated patch clamp, multielectrode array, and computational modeling. Induced pluripotent stem cellâderived cardiomyocytes have been used to study long QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and other hereditary cardiac disorders. Although induced pluripotent stem cellâderived cardiomyocytes are distinct from adult cardiomyocytes, they provide a robust platform to advance the science and clinical care of sudden cardiac death.},

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent and independently associated with atrial fibrillation among patients with HCM. Objective To determine the relationship between non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and OSA in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Methods One hundred thirty consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of HOCM in Fuwai Hospital between September 2017 and May 2018 were included. Polysomnography and Holter electrocardiography were performed in all patients. Results Of 130 patients, 72 (55.4{\%}) were diagnosed with OSA, including 38 with mild, 21 with moderate, and 13 with severe OSA, and 27 (20.8{\%}) patients had NSVT. The prevalence of NSVT increased with the severity of OSA (none, mild, moderate, and severe: 12.1{\%}, 15.8{\%}, 33.3{\%}, and 53.8{\%}, respectively; p for trend Conclusion The presence and severity of OSA in patients with HOCM is independently associated with NSVT, which is a risk factor for SCD and cardiovascular death in this population.},

abstract = {Importance: Early-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) can be the initial manifestation of a more serious underlying inherited cardiomyopathy or arrhythmia syndrome. Objective: To examine the results of genetic testing for early-onset AF. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective, observational cohort study enrolled participants from an academic medical center who had AF diagnosed before 66 years of age and underwent whole genome sequencing through the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine program. Participants were enrolled from November 23, 1999, to June 2, 2015. Data analysis was performed from October 24, 2020, to March 11, 2021. Exposures: Rare variants identified in a panel of 145 genes that are included on cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia panels used by commercial clinical genetic testing laboratories. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sequencing data were analyzed using an automated process followed by manual review by a panel of independent, blinded reviewers. The primary outcome was classification of rare variants using American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics criteria: benign, likely benign, variant of undetermined significance, likely pathogenic, or pathogenic. Disease-associated variants were defined as pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in genes associated with autosomal dominant or X-linked dominant disorders. Results: Among 1293 participants (934 [72.2{\%}] male; median [interquartile range] age at enrollment, 56 [48-61] years; median [interquartile range] age at AF diagnosis, 50 [41-56] years), genetic testing identified 131 participants (10.1{\%}) with a disease-associated variant, 812 (62.8{\%}) with a variant of undetermined significance, 92 (7.1{\%}) as heterozygous carriers for an autosomal recessive disorder, and 258 (20.0{\%}) with no suspicious variant. The likelihood of a disease-associated variant was highest in participants with AF diagnosed before the age of 30 years (20 of 119 [16.8{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 10.0{\%}-23.6{\%}]) and lowest after the age of 60 years (8 of 112 [7.1{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 2.4{\%}-11.9{\%}]). Disease-associated variants were more often associated with inherited cardiomyopathy syndromes compared with inherited arrhythmias. The most common genes were TTN (n = 38), MYH7 (n = 18), MYH6 (n = 10), LMNA (n = 9), and KCNQ1 (n = 8). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, genetic testing identified a disease-associated variant in 10{\%} of patients with early-onset AF (the percentage was higher if diagnosed before the age of 30 years and lower if diagnosed after the age of 60 years). Most pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants are in genes associated with cardiomyopathy. These results support the use of genetic testing in early-onset AF..},

abstract = {Background-Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an acute heart failure syndrome characterized by myocardial hypocontractility from the mid left ventricle to the apex. It is precipitated by extreme stress and can be triggered by intravenous catecholamine administration, particularly epinephrine. Despite its grave presentation, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is rapidly reversible, with generally good prognosis. We hypothesized that this represents switching of epinephrine signaling through the pleiotropic $\beta$ 2-adrenergic receptor ($\beta$ 2AR) from canonical stimulatory G-protein-activated cardiostimulant to inhibitory G-protein-activated cardiodepressant pathways. Methods and Results-We describe an in vivo rat model in which a high intravenous epinephrine, but not norepinephrine, bolus produces the characteristic reversible apical depression of myocardial contraction coupled with basal hypercontractility. The effect is prevented via Gi inactivation by pertussis toxin pretreatment. $\beta$ 2AR number and functional responses were greater in isolated apical cardiomyocytes than in basal cardiomyocytes, which confirmed the higher apical sensitivity and response to circulating epinephrine. In vitro studies demonstrated high-dose epinephrine can induce direct cardiomyocyte cardiodepression and cardioprotection in a $\beta$ 2AR- Gi-dependent manner. Preventing epinephrine-Gi effects increased mortality in the Takotsubo model, whereas $\beta$-blockers that activate $\beta$ 2AR- Gi exacerbated the epinephrine-dependent negative inotropic effects without further deaths. In contrast, levosimendan rescued the acute cardiac dysfunction without increased mortality. Conclusions-We suggest that biased agonism of epinephrine for $\beta$ 2AR-Gs at low concentrations and for Gi at high concentrations underpins the acute apical cardiodepression observed in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, with an apical-basal gradient in $\beta$ 2ARs explaining the differential regional responses. We suggest this epinephrine-specific $\beta$ 2AR-Gi signaling may have evolved as a cardioprotective strategy to limit catecholamine-induced myocardial toxicity during acute stress. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Heart Association, Inc.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Vital exhaustion (VE), a construct defined as lack of energy, increased fatigue and irritability, and feelings of demoralisation, has been associated with cardiovascular events. We sought to examine the relation between VE and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. METHODS The ARIC Study is a predominately biracial cohort of men and women, aged 45-64 at baseline, initiated in 1987 through random sampling in four US communities. VE was measured using the Maastricht questionnaire between 1990 and 1992 among 13 923 individuals. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the hazard of out-of-hospital SCD across tertiles of VE scores. RESULTS Through 2012, 457 SCD cases, defined as a sudden pulseless condition presumed due to a ventricular tachyarrhythmia in a previously stable individual, were identified in ARIC by physician record review. Adjusting for age, sex and race/centre, participants in the highest VE tertile had an increased risk of SCD (HR 1.48, 95{\%} CI 1.17 to 1.87), but these findings did not remain significant after adjustment for established cardiovascular disease risk factors (HR 0.94, 95{\%} CI 0.73 to 1.20). CONCLUSIONS Among participants of the ARIC study, VE was not associated with an increased risk for SCD after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors.},
