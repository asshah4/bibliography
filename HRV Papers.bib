abstract = {Background: Schizophrenia is associated with increased cardiac mortality. A disturbed autonomic modulation of heart rate (HR) has been described in patients with schizophrenia in whom antipsychotic medication may represent an additional cardiac risk. The novel measure deceleration capacity (DC) of heart rate predicts cardiac mortality in patients with cardiovascular illnesses. The aim of the present paper was to calculate DC in patients with schizophrenia and to compare this measure with established parameters of heart rate variability (HRV). Methods: HRV and DC were calculated in 24-hour electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of 20 unmedicated, 40 medicated patients with schizophrenia and 40 controls. As activity has a major influence on HRV, 4-hour periods of " sleep-" and " wake-" ECG were evaluated as additional parameters. Actigraphy was used to ensure comparable levels of activity in patients and controls. Results: The DC as well as the other established HRV measures were not significantly different comparing unmedicated patients with schizophrenia to healthy controls. However, medicated patients showed a significant reduction of DC calculated from ECG recordings during 4. hour over night periods. Conclusion: Calculation of DC might contribute to a better monitoring and identification of an increased risk of cardiac mortality in patients with schizophrenia undergoing antipsychotic treatment. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to characterize the functional relationships between behaviorally evoked regional brain activation and cardiac autonomic activity in humans. Concurrent estimates of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF; obtained by positron emission tomography), heart period, and high-frequency heart period variability (HF-HPV; an indicator of cardiac parasympathetic activity) were examined in 93 adults (aged 50-70 years) who performed a series of increasingly difficult working-memory tasks. Increased task difficulty resulted in decreased heart period (indicating cardioacceleration) and decreased HF-HPV (indicating decreased cardiac parasympathetic activity). Task-induced decreases in heart period and HF-HPV were associated with concurrent increases and decreases in rCBF to cortical and subcortical brain regions that are speculated to regulate cardiac autonomic activity during behavioral processes: the medial-prefrontal, insular, and anterior cingulate cortices, the amygdala-hippocampal complex, and the cerebellum. These findings replicate and extend a small number of functional neuroimaging studies that suggest an important role for both cortical and subcortical brain systems in human cardiac autonomic regulation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Clinical depression is a risk factor for cardiac mortality in patients with coronary heart disease. High QT interval variability is a risk factor for arrhythmic events, including sudden cardiac death. The purpose of this study was to determine whether depression is associated with increased QT variability in patients recovering from myocardial infarction. METHODS: Twenty patients with major depression recovering from a recent myocardial infarction were matched with 20 nondepressed post-myocardial infarction patients on age and sex, and all underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring. RESULTS: There were no differences between groups on average heart rate, heart rate variability, or other electrocardiographic measures. However, the QT interval showed significantly greater variability in the depressed than in the nondepressed group, especially at midnight and at 6:00 AM. CONCLUSIONS: Depressed post-myocardial infarction patients may be at greater risk for sudden cardiac death as a result of abnormalities in ventricular repolarization. More work is needed to determine the clinical and prognostic significance of QT variability in these patients.},

abstract = {Background: High-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) is a measure of parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) output that has been associated with enhanced self-regulation. Low resting levels of HF-HRV are associated with nicotine dependence and blunted stress-related changes in HF-HRV are associated with decreased ability to resist smoking. Meditation has been shown to increase HF-HRV. However, it is unknown whether tonic levels of HF-HRV or acute changes in HF-HRV during meditation predict treatment responses in addictive behaviors such as smoking cessation. Purpose: To investigate the relationship between HF-HRV and subsequent smoking outcomes. Methods: HF-HRV during resting baseline and during mindfulness meditation was measured within two weeks of completing a 4-week smoking cessation intervention in a sample of 31 community participants. Self-report measures of smoking were obtained at a follow up 17-weeks after the initiation of treatment. Results: Regression analyses indicated that individuals exhibiting acute increases in HF-HRV from resting baseline to meditation smoked fewer cigarettes at follow-up than those who exhibited acute decreases in HF-HRV (b = -4.89, p = 0.008). Conclusion: Acute changes in HF-HRV in response to meditation may be a useful tool to predict smoking cessation treatment response.},

abstract = {Background: Studies of the autonomic nervous system in posttraumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) have focused on the sympathetic modulation of arousal and have neglected the parasympathetic contribution. This study addresses the parasympathetic control of heart rate in individuals who have survived traumatic events. Methods: Twenty-nine survivors, 14 with current PTSD and 15 without, participated in the study. The groups were comparable with regard to age, type of trauma, time since the latest traumatic event, and lifetime exposure to traumatic events. Electrocardiograms were recorded during rest and an arithmetic task. Heart period, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and the amplitude of the Traube-Hering-Mayer wave were quantified. Results: The groups did not differ on resting measures. During the arithmetic task, the past trauma group showed a significant increase in RSA (p {\textless} .007), whereas the PTSD group did not. In the past trauma group only, RSA and heart period were highly correlated (r = .75), thereby suggesting that the response to challenge was under vagal control. Conclusions: Trauma survivors who develop PTSD differ from those who do not in the extent to which their heart rate response to challenge is controlled by vagal activity. Responses to challenge in PTSD may be mediated by nonvagal, possibly sympathetic mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2001 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {This consensus guideline was prepared on behalf of the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrocardiology and is cosponsored by the Japanese Circulation Society, the Computers in Cardiology Working Group on e-Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology, and the European Cardiac Arrhythmia Society. It discusses the electrocardiographic phenomenon of T-wave alternans (TWA) (i.e., a beat-to-beat alternation in the morphology and amplitude of the ST- segment or T-wave). This statement focuses on its physiological basis and measurement technologies and its clinical utility in stratifying risk for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Signal processing techniques including the frequency-domain Spectral Method and the time-domain Modified Moving Average method have demonstrated the utility of TWA in arrhythmia risk stratification in prospective studies in {\textgreater}12,000 patients. The majority of exercise-based studies using both methods have reported high relative risks for cardiovascular mortality and for sudden cardiac death in patients with preserved as well as depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. Studies with ambulatory electrocardiogram-based TWA analysis with Modified Moving Average method have yielded significant predictive capacity. However, negative studies with the Spectral Method have also appeared, including 2 interventional studies in patients with implantable defibrillators. Meta-analyses have been performed to gain insights into this issue. Frontiers of TWA research include use in arrhythmia risk stratification of individuals with preserved ejection fraction, improvements in predictivity with quantitative analysis, and utility in guiding medical as well as device-based therapy. Overall, although TWA appears to be a useful marker of risk for arrhythmic and cardiovascular death, there is as yet no definitive evidence that it can guide therapy. {\textcopyright} 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

@article{Lampert2008,
abstract = {Background: Many traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) are associated with altered autonomic function. Inflammation may provide a link between risk factors, autonomic dysfunction, and CAD. We examined the association between heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function, and inflammation, measured by C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Methods: We examined 264 middle-aged male twins free of symptomatic CAD. All underwent ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring and 24-hour ultra low, very low, low, and high-frequency power were calculated using power spectral analysis. C-reactive protein and IL-6 were measured, and risk factors including age, smoking, hypertension, lipids, diabetes, body mass index (BMI), depression, and physical activity were assessed. Results: Physical activity, BMI, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, depression, and hypertension were directly associated with CRP and IL-6 and inversely associated with one or more HRV variables. There was a graded inverse relationship between all HRV parameters (except high frequency) and CRP and IL-6. After adjustment for age, BMI, activity, high-density lipoprotein, smoking, hypertension, depression, and diabetes, ultra low frequency and very low frequency remained significant predictors of CRP (P {\textless} .01). Conclusions: C-reactive protein is associated with decreased HRV, even after controlling for traditional CAD risk factors. Autonomic dysregulation leading to inflammation may represent one pathway through which traditional risk factors promote development of CAD. {\textcopyright} 2008 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Blechert2007,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and panic disorder (PD) are two anxiety disorders with prominent psychophysiological symptoms. The PTSD criterion of persistent hyperarousal suggests autonomic dysregulation, and the disorder has been associated with elevated heart rate. In contrast, PD has been associated with respiratory abnormalities such as low end-tidal Pco(2). An integrated analysis of automatic and respiratory function in a direct comparison of these anxiety disorders is currently lacking. METHODS: Electrodermal, cardiovascular, and respiratory psychophysiology was examined in 23 PTSD patients, 26 PD patients, and 32 healthy individuals at baseline and during threat of shock. RESULTS: At baseline, the PTSD patients, in contrast to the other two groups, were characterized by attenuated parasympathetic and elevated sympathetic control, as evidenced by low respiratory sinus arrhythmia (a measure of cardiac vagal control) and high electrodermal activity. They also displayed elevated heart rate and cardiovascular sympathetic activation in comparison with healthy controls. PD patients exhibited lower Pco(2) (hypocapnia) and higher cardiovascular sympathetic activation compared with healthy controls. PTSD patients, but not PD patients, sighed more frequently than controls. During the threat of shock phase, the PTSD group demonstrated blunted electrodermal responses. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent hyperarousal symptoms in PTSD seem to be due to high sympathetic activity coupled with low parasympathetic cardiac control. Respiratory abnormalities were also present in PTSD. Several psychophysiological measures exhibited group-comparison effect sizes in the order of 1.0, supporting their potential for enhancing differential diagnosis and possibly suggesting utility as endophenotypes in genetic studies of anxiety disorders.},

abstract = {Depression is common in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and is a risk factor for cardiac morbidity and mortality in these patients. Depression is associated with autonomic nervous system dysfunction, which may at least partially explain this increased risk. Low heart rate variability (HRV), which reflects excessive sympathetic and/or inadequate parasympathetic modulation of heart rate, is a strong predictor of mortality in patients with CHD. Most studies-both in patients with stable CHD and in patients with a recent acute coronary event-have found HRV to be lower in depressed patients than in their nondepressed counterparts. This manuscript provides an overview of this literature and concludes that HRV may account for a substantial part of the risk associated with depression in CHD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Arrhythmia risk stratification with regard to prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy is a completely unsolved issue in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Arrhythmia risk stratification was performed prospectively in 343 patients with IDC, including analysis of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and size by echocardiography, signal-averaged ECG, arrhythmias on Holter ECG, QTc dispersion, heart rate variability, baroreflex sensitivity, and microvolt T-wave alternans. During 52+/-21 months of follow-up, major arrhythmic events, defined as sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or sudden death, occurred in 46 patients (13{\%}). On multivariate analysis, LV ejection fraction was the only significant arrhythmia risk predictor in patients with sinus rhythm, with a relative risk of 2.3 per 10{\%} decrease of ejection fraction (95{\%} CI, 1.5 to 3.3; P=0.0001). Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on Holter was associated with a trend toward higher arrhythmia risk (RR, 1.7; 95{\%} CI, 0.9 to 3.3; P=0.11), whereas beta-blocker therapy was associated with a trend toward lower arrhythmia risk (RR, 0.6; 95{\%} CI, 0.3 to 1.2; P=0.13). In patients with atrial fibrillation, multivariate Cox analysis also identified LV ejection fraction and absence of beta-blocker therapy as the only significant arrhythmia risk predictors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Reduced LV ejection fraction and lack of beta-blocker use are important arrhythmia risk predictors in IDC, whereas signal-averaged ECG, baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate variability, and T-wave alternans do not seem to be helpful for arrhythmia risk stratification. These findings have important implications for the design of future studies evaluating prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy in IDC.},

abstract = {Two symbolic indexes, the percentage of sequences characterized by three heart periods with no significant variations (0V{\%}) and that with two significant unlike variations (2UV{\%}), have been found to reflect changes in sympathetic and vagal modulations, respectively. We tested the hypothesis that symbolic indexes may track the gradual shift of the cardiac autonomic modulation during an incremental head-up tilt test. Symbolic analysis was carried out over heart period variability series (250 cardiac beats) derived from ECG recordings during a graded head-up tilt test (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 degrees ) in 17 healthy subjects. The percentage of subjects showing a significant linear correlation (Spearman rank-order correlation) with tilt angles was utilized to evaluate the performance of symbolic analysis. Spectral analysis was carried out for comparison over the same series. 0V{\%} progressively increased with tilt angles, whereas 2UV{\%} gradually decreased. The decline of 2UV{\%} was greater than the increase of 0V{\%} at low tilt angles. Linear correlation with tilt angles was exhibited in a greater percentage of subjects for 0V{\%} and 2UV{\%} than for any spectral index. Our findings suggest that symbolic analysis performed better than spectral analysis and, thus, is a suitable methodology for assessment of the subtle changes of cardiac autonomic modulation induced by a graded head-up tilt test. Moreover, symbolic analysis indicates that the changes of cardiac sympathetic and vagal modulations observed during this protocol were reciprocal but characterized by different absolute magnitudes.},

abstract = {Background: Depression is associated with increased risk of death among patients with coronary disease. Cardiovascular autonomic dysregulation may be one of the mechanisms by which depression exerts its effects on cardiovascular function. The purpose of this study was to determine whether depressive symptoms are associated with low heart rate variability (HRV) and prolonged HR recovery after exercise testing in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods: The Psychophysiological Investigation of Myocardial Ischemia (PIMI) was a large, multicenter study designed to assess psychological and physiological correlates of stress in patients with CAD. One hundred and eighty-eight patients with CAD as evidenced by at least 50{\%} blockage of one major artery and a previous positive exercise stress test were included in this study. Patients included in this report were not taking beta blockers. Cardiovascular functioning was assessed by a modified Bruce protocol treadmill stress test. Measures of psychological functioning, including the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), were also obtained. Results: BDI scores were negatively correlated with HR recovery (r = -0.15, p = .04). Depression scores accounted for 3.5{\%} of the variance in HR recovery when controlling for participant age (p {\textless} .01). Depressive symptoms were related to two HRV indices (ultra-low frequency, high frequency). Conclusions: Depressive symptoms are associated with cardiovascular autonomic nervous system dysfunction as assessed by HR recovery. This relationship is not merely due to an association of depression severity with beta blocker usage or a failure of depressed patients to achieve an adequate chronotropic response.

@article{Eckberg1997,
abstract = {Given the importance of the autonomic nervous system to cardiovascular health, it is not surprising that there is and has been great interest in measurements of human sympathetic and vagus nerve traffic as tools that might inform physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms. Pagani and coworkers1 advanced the provocative notion that the instantaneous balance between sympathetic and vagal nerve activities can be captured by a single number, obtained by dividing RR-interval spectral power centered at ≈0.1 Hz by spectral power centered at higher, primarily respiratory frequencies. This ratio, or sympathovagal balance, has been embraced with great enthusiasm2 because it offers new possibilities for understanding dynamic, critically important autonomic interrelations in humans by the use of totally noninvasive, unobtrusive means.3 The broad bases for this mathematical treatment are as follows: (1) 0.1-Hz RR intervals are importantly mediated by fluctuations of sympathetic nerve activity; (2) higher-frequency RR-interval rhythms are mediated almost exclusively by fluctuations of vagal-cardiac nerve activity; and (3) physiological interventions tend to provoke reciprocal changes of sympathetic and vagal neural outflows. Sympathovagal balance, the ratio of these periodicities, is taken to reflect the balance between the opposing neural mechanisms. This review examines the physiological foundations of sympathovagal balance. Previous Section Next Section The Method and Its Mathematics The ECG is recorded with the subject in a steady state (when rhythms are stationary) for a period sufficiently long to define events occurring over frequencies of interest. RR-interval spectral power is calculated from this series of intervals with an autoregressive algorithm, which yields center frequencies and absolute power of component fluctuations, based on a model whose order (the number of parameters) is selected automatically to minimize Akaike's information criterion statistic.4 (The statistical uncertainty and consequences of the automatic selection of the autoregressive model have not been defined fully; however, it is clear that the model order importantly determines both center frequency and magnitude of spectral peaks.5) Autoregressive analyses of short (≤5 minutes) RR-interval time series typically yield three peaks in very low (0 to 0.04 Hz; VLF), low (0.04 to 0.15 Hz; LF), and respiratory or high (0.15 to 0.40 Hz; HF) frequency ranges.6 Published examples (Fig 1⇓ in Reference 11 and Figs 5c⇓ and 5d⇓ in Reference 66 ) suggest that in such short-term recordings, these three frequencies account for almost all spectral power (in the examples, 94.6{\%}, 96.1{\%}, and 98.5{\%}). Therefore, in practice, power in normalized (also called relative or fractional) units (nu) is power centered at the frequency of interest (LF or HF) divided by total power less power at VLFs. Thus, LF nu=LF/(LF+HF) and HF nu=HF/(LF+HF). Sympathovagal balance is the ratio between LF and respiratory-frequency powers. Sympathovagal balance (in dimensionless units) is simply the ratio of absolute LF to absolute HF power, or LF/HF. Figure 1.

Direct multifiber vagal-cardiac (VND) and sympathetic-cardiac (SND) nerve recordings from one anesthetized, decerebrate cat. Reproduced with permission.3 imp. indicates impulse; PSD, power spectral density. Several consequences issue from the mathematics of sympathovagal balance. First, a change of either the numerator or the denominator must change the fraction. Thus, a reduction of LF with no change of HF will reduce the fraction, and a reduction of HF with no change of LF will increase the fraction. According to published precedents,1,3 the former change would be interpreted as a shift of sympathovagal balance toward vagal predominance and the latter as a shift of sympathovagal balance toward sympathetic predominance. Second, because calculations of normalized LF and HF powers involve merely rearrangement of the same LF and HF terms, a change of normalized LF power must necessarily be associated with a change of normalized HF power. For the same reason, relations among the different calculated values can be predicted simply on the basis of mathematics. For example, if LF and HF are distributed nearly normally, sympathovagal balance, plotted as a function of normalized LF power, will be almost exponential. The remaining discussion touches on some of the physiological and pathophysiological processes that contribute to sympathovagal balance. The discussion is organized as a series of postulates that I believe tacitly or explicitly underlie the concept. The Numerator Human cardiovascular rhythms occurring at ≈0.1 Hz are of great interest because they convey information regarding activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Healthy humans may have strong fluctuations of muscle sympathetic nerve activity about every 10 seconds,7 a period that is sufficiently long for vascular smooth muscle and sinoatrial node effectors to respond to released norepinephrine and to modulate arterial pressure and heart rate.8 LF RR-Interval Rhythms Reflect Sympathetic Nerve Traffic to the Heart Malliani and coworkers3 published what may be the only power spectral analyses of sympathetic and vagus nerve traffic assumed but not proven to be destined for the heart. Fig 1⇑ shows preganglionic thoracic sympathetic and vagus nerve discharges measured from one artificially ventilated decerebrate cat. My integration of the two LF spectral powers in this figure suggests that sympathetic spectral power is ≈15{\%} greater than vagal spectral power. Kingwell and colleagues9 studied healthy supine subjects and found no significant correlation between myocardial norepinephrine spillover and absolute or relative 0.1-Hz RR-interval spectral power. Saul and coworkers10 also studied healthy supine subjects and found no significant correlation between baseline peroneal sympathetic nerve activity expressed as bursts/min (or antecubital vein plasma norepinephrine levels) and absolute or normalized LF heart rate spectral power. Hopf et al11 and Introna et al12 measured RR-interval spectral power before and after high spinal anesthesia. Sympathetic blockade in the supine position (but see responses to tilt below) did not alter absolute or relative 0.1-Hz RR-interval spectral power significantly. Pagani et al1 reported that propranolol 0.2 mg/kg IV does not reduce normalized 0.1-Hz RR-interval spectral power significantly. Moreover, Jokkel et al13 reported that short-term $\beta$-adrenergic blockade actually increases 0.1-Hz frequency RR-interval spectral power. Long-term $\beta$-adrenergic blockade reduces normalized 0.1-Hz RR-interval spectral power.1 Low-dose cholinergic blocking drugs, such as atropine and scopolamine, paradoxically increase average RR intervals14 and LF RR-interval spectral power.15 Increased LF spectral power is unlikely to be due to increased sympathetic nerve traffic because atropine does not alter (muscle) sympathetic nerve activity or plasma norepinephrine levels.16 Conversely, large-dose atropine abolishes nearly all RR-interval spectral power in LF as well as HF ranges.17,18 The simplest interpretation of the effects of large-dose atropine is that it blocks sinoatrial responses to acetylcholine released by vagus nerve traffic; atropine does not alter heart rate in the absence of vagus nerve activity.19 Thus, vagal contributions to baseline LF RR-interval fluctuations are great, and evidence that baseline LF RR-interval spectral power is related quantitatively to sympathetic-cardiac nerve traffic is nonexistent. Changes of 0.1-Hz RR-Interval Spectral Power Reflect Changes of Sympathetic-Cardiac Nerve Traffic Two groups have sought correlations between muscle sympathetic nerve traffic and heart rate or RR-interval spectral power over a range of arterial pressures provoked by graded infusions of nitroprusside and phenylephrine. Saul and coworkers10 found significant correlations between sympathetic nerve activity, expressed as bursts/min, and normalized LF heart rate spectral power, but only in 4 of 10 subjects studied. Pagani and associates20 found no significant correlation between sympathetic nerve activity, expressed as bursts/min, and normalized LF RR-interval spectral power. However, Pagani did find a highly significant but probably weak correlation between sympathetic nerve activity, expressed as burst area per second, and normalized LF RR-interval spectral power. The studies by Saul et al10 and Pagani et al20 differ in several respects. First, Saul normalized sympathetic bursts; Pagani did not. Normalization is necessary because burst heights differ among individuals; if sympathetic activity is not normalized, subjects with large sympathetic bursts will dominate average results. Second, subjects in the study by Saul et al controlled their breathing frequencies; those in the study by Pagani et al did not. As discussed below, breathing frequency profoundly influences spectral power measurements. Third, Saul reported individual regressions; Pagani did not. (It cannot be determined from the article by Pagani et al if there is a significant correlation between muscle sympathetic burst area per second and normalized LF RR-interval spectral power.) Rather, Pagani used a nonparametric regression analysis (Theil21) of all his data, both within and across subjects. This may have been inappropriate, because the Theil method requires that data be stochastically independent. Repeated measures (seven in each subject) violate this condition. Koh and coworkers18 also measured RR-interval spectral power during infusions of nitroprusside and phenylephrine. Fig 2⇓ shows RR-interval spectral power of healthy subjects and patients with complete high cervical spinal cord injuries during saline infusion and two or three levels of nitroprusside and phenylephrine.

abstract = {To clarify the influence of gender on sympathetic and parasympathetic control of heart rate in middle-aged subjects and on the subsequent aging process, heart rate variability (HRV) was studied in normal populations of women (n = 598) and men (n = 472) ranging in age from 40 to 79 yr. These groups were divided into eight age strata at 5-yr intervals and were clinically diagnosed as having no hypertension, hypotension, diabetic neuropathy, or cardiac arrhythmia. Frequency-domain analysis of short-term, stationary R-R intervals was performed, which reveals very-low-frequency power (VLF; 0.003-0.04 Hz), low-frequency power (LF; 0.04-0.15 Hz), high-frequency power (HF; 0.15-0.40 Hz), the ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF), and LF and HF power in normalized units (LF{\%} and HF{\%}, respectively). The distribution of variance, VLF, LF, HF, and LF/HF exhibited acute skewness, which was adjusted by natural logarithmic transformation. Women had higher HF in the age strata from 40 to 49 yr, whereas men had higher LF{\%} and LF/HF between 40 and 59 yr. No disparity in HRV measurements was found between the sexes in age strata {\textgreater}/=60 yr. Although absolute measurements of HRV (variance, VLF, LF, and HF) decreased linearly with age, no significant change in relative measurements (LF/HF, LF{\%}, and HF{\%}), especially in men, was detected until age 60 yr. We conclude that middle-aged women and men have a more dominant parasympathetic and sympathetic regulation of heart rate, respectively. The gender-related difference in parasympathetic regulation diminishes after age 50 yr, whereas a significant time delay for the disappearance of sympathetic dominance occurs in men.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mental stress is associated with sympathetic adrenergic stimulation and concomitant increases in blood pressure and heart rate. Heritable individual differences in cardiovascular functional response to mental stress may arise from genetic variations in adrenergic receptors, which might produce excessive hemodynamic response to mental stress or create other conditions favoring the development of myocardial ischemia. METHODS: We examined the relationship between hemodynamic response to mental stress and mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) and 5 common functional polymorphisms of beta1-adrenergic receptors (ADRB1 [OMIM 109630, accession No. 153]) and beta2-adrenergic receptors (ADRB2 [OMIM 109690, accession No. 154]). Participants were 148 patients (45 female [30.4{\%}]) with a documented history of coronary artery disease and a mean (SD) age of 64 (9) years. Patients were enrolled between December 9, 2004, and February 21, 2007. Mental stress was induced via a public-speaking task. Rest and stress myocardial perfusion imaging was performed. Blood samples were collected and genotyped for 5 common functional polymorphisms of ADRB1 (codons 49 and 389) and ADRB2 (codons 16 and 27 and nucleotide 523). The main outcome measures were hemodynamic and myocardial ischemic responses to mental stress. Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia was defined as new or worsening perfusion defects during mental stress with a summed (stress to rest) difference score of at least 3. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was noted in the prevalences of MSIMI between genotype groups for codon 49 of ADRB1. Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia occurred 3 times more frequently among patients homozygous for the Ser49 allele (31 of 104 patients [29.8{\%}]) compared with 4 of 39 patients (10.3{\%}) among the Gly49 allele carriers (P=.02). The adjusted odds ratio for the effect of genotype (Ser/Ser vs Gly carriers) on MSIMI was 3.9 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.2-12.5) (P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate an association between a common genetic variation in ADRB1 and myocardial ischemic response to mental stress in patients with coronary artery disease. This polymorphic genetic marker may help identify patients at increased risk for mental stress-induced adverse outcomes.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV), the beat-to-beat variation in either heart rate or the duration of the R-R interval - the heart period, has become a popular clinical and investigational tool. The temporal fluctuations in heart rate exhibit a marked synchrony with respiration (increasing during inspiration and decreasing during expiration - the so called respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA) and are widely believed to reflect changes in cardiac autonomic regulation. Although the exact contributions of the parasympathetic and the sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system to this variability are controversial and remain the subject of active investigation and debate, a number of time and frequency domain techniques have been developed to provide insight into cardiac autonomic regulation in both health and disease. It is the purpose of this essay to provide an historical overview of the evolution in the concept of HRV. Briefly, pulse rate was first measured by ancient Greek physicians and scientists. However, it was not until the invention of the "Physician's Pulse Watch" (a watch with a second hand that could be stopped) in 1707 that changes in pulse rate could be accurately assessed. The Rev. Stephen Hales (1733) was the first to note that pulse varied with respiration and in 1847 Carl Ludwig was the first to record RSA. With the measurement of the ECG (1895) and advent of digital signal processing techniques in the 1960s, investigation of HRV and its relationship to health and disease has exploded. This essay will conclude with a brief description of time domain, frequency domain, and non-linear dynamic analysis techniques (and their limitations) that are commonly used to measure HRV.},

Ten healthy female subjects volunteered for the experiment. Chest electrocardiogram and respiration curve were recorded before, after, and during watching a comedy or a tragedy video. We also asked them to fill out profiles of mood states (POMS) to evaluate their mood states while watching videos. Autonomic nervous function was estimated by spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). All subjects more or less laughed and wept while watching comedy and tragedy videos, respectively. Anger-hostility score of the POMS decreased and vigor score increased significantly after watching comedy videos, while depression-dejection score increased significantly after watching tragedy ones. Although both contents tended to increase a low to high frequency component ratio (LF/HF ratio) of HRV, the time course of responses was different. The LF/HF ratio which reflects cardiac sympathovagal balance increased immediately after they started watching comedy videos, and returned to the basal level right after they stopped watching, whereas the LF/HF ratio increased gradually to a lesser extent while watching tragedy videos. In contrast, the high-frequency component which reflects cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity gradually decreased while watching both videos but did not return to the basal level after watching tragedy ones. These results suggest that laughing has strong but transient effects on the autonomic nervous system, while weeping or feeling sad has moderate but sustained effects on it.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Risk stratification by means of analysis of QT dispersion (QTD) in the 12-lead surface ECG is under intense investigation in various patient populations. The aim of the present prospective study was to evaluate the prognostic value of QTD and other ECG variables reflecting dispersion of ventricular repolarization in comparison with established risk stratifiers during long-term follow-up in a large cohort of post-myocardial infarction patients treated according to contemporary therapeutic guidelines. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 280 consecutive infarct survivors, the 12-lead ECG was optically scanned and digitized for analysis of QTD (QTmax-QTmin) and 25 other repolarization variables, including recently developed and validated parameters such as the T peak-to-T end interval and the area under the T wave. In addition, a variety of established risk stratifiers were assessed. After a mean follow-up period of 32+/-10 months, 30 patients reached one of the prospectively defined study end points (death, ventricular tachycardia, or resuscitated ventricular fibrillation). Comparisons between event and nonevent patients by means of Kaplan-Meier event probability analyses revealed that none of the ECG dispersion variables were of discriminative value. In contrast, variables such as left ventricular ejection fraction (P=0.007), mean 24-hour heart rate (P=0.022), or heart rate variability (P=0.007) proved to be potentially useful risk stratifiers in this patient population. On multivariate analysis, only LVEF, heart rate variability, and a history of thrombolysis were independent predictors of outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Determination of QTD from the surface ECG even when performed with the best available methodology failed to predict subsequent risk in this large series of infarct survivors.},

abstract = {Background: Depression is associated with an increased risk for mortality after acute myocardial infarction (MI). The purpose of this study was to determine whether low heart rate variability (HRV) mediates the effect of depression on mortality. Methods: Twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were obtained from 311 depressed patients with a recent acute MI who were enrolled in the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease (ENRICHD) clinical trial and from 367 nondepressed patients who met the ENRICHD medical inclusion criteria. Standard HRV indexes were extracted from the recordings. Results: The log of very low-frequency (LnVLF) power, an index of HRV derived from power spectral analysis of the electrocardiogram signal (0.0033-0.04 Hz [in milliseconds squared]), was lower in the depressed than in the nondepressed patients (P{\textless}.001). There were 47 deaths (6.1{\%}) during a 30-month follow-up. After adjusting for potential confounders, the depressed patients remained at higher risk for all-cause mortality compared with the nondepressed patients (hazard ratio, 2.8; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.4-5.4; P{\textless}.003). When LnVLF power was entered into the model, the hazard ratio for depression dropped to 2.1 (95{\%} CI, 1.1-4.2; P=.03). The proportion of the risk for depression attributable to LnVLF power was 0.27 (95{\%} CI, 0.23-0.31; P{\textless}.001). Conclusions: Low HRV partially mediates the effect of depression on survival after acute MI. This finding helps to clarify the physiological mechanisms underlying depression's role as a risk factor for mortality in patients with coronary heart disease. It also raises the possibility that treatments that improve both depression and HRV might also improve survival in these patients. {\textcopyright}2005 American Medical Association.

abstract = {Various combinations of sympathetic and vagal tone can yield the same heart rate, while ventricular electrophysiology differs. To demonstrate this in humans, we studied healthy volunteers in the sitting position with horizontal legs. First, heart rate was increased by lowering the legs to 60 degrees and back. Thereafter, heart rate was increased by handgrip. In each subject, a leg-lowering angle was selected at which heart rate matched best with heart rate in the third handgrip minute. Thirteen subjects had a heart rate match better than 1{\%}. Heart rate (control: 65.2+/-9.0 bpm) increased to 72.1+/-8.7 (leg lowering) and to 72.1+/-8.8 (handgrip) bpm. QRS azimuth, QRS duration, maximal T vector, T azimuth, T elevation, ST duration, QRS-T angle and QT interval differed significantly (P{\textless}0.05) between leg lowering and handgrip (QT interval 418+/-15 versus 435+/-21 ms). Also, septal dispersion of repolarization, assessed as the time difference between the apex and the end of the T wave in the V2 and V3 leads, differed significantly (V2: 96.7+/-19.3 versus 110.0+/-23.3 ms, P{\textless}0.01; V3: 88.7+/-19.3 versus 97.3+/-23.3 ms; P{\textless}0.01). Hence, leg lowering and handgrip cause different ventricular depolarization and repolarization. The hypertensive handgrip manoeuvre entails a longer QT interval and probably an increased septal dispersion of repolarization.},

abstract = {Autonomic neuropathy is associated with poor prognosis. Cardiovascular reflexes are essential for the diagnosis of autonomic nerve dysfunction. Blood pressure response to standing is the most simple test for the evaluation of sympathetic integrity, however it is still discussed which diagnostic criteria of abnormal response should be considered as optimal. The EURODIAB IDDM Complications Study involved the examination of randomly selected Type 1 diabetic patients from 31 centres in 16 European counties. Data from 3007 patients were available for the present evaluation. Two tests of autonomic function (response of heart rate /R-R ratio/ and blood pressure from lying to standing) just as the frequency of feeling faint on standing up were assessed. R-R ratio was abnormal in 24{\%} of patients. According to different diagnostic criteria of abnormal BP response to standing ({\textgreater}30 mmHg, {\textgreater}20 mmHg, and {\textgreater}10 mmHg fall in systolic BP), the frequency of abnormal results was 5.9{\%}, 18{\%} and 32{\%}, respectively (p {\textless} 0.001). The frequency of feeling faint on standing was 18{\%}, thus, it was identical with the prevalence of abnormal blood pressure response to standing when {\textgreater}20 mmHg fall in systolic blood pressure was considered as abnormal. Feeling faint on standing correlated significantly with both autonomic test results (p {\textless} 0.001). A fall {\textgreater}20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure after standing up seems to be the most reliable criterion for the assessment of orthostatic hypotension in the diagnosis of autonomic neuropathy in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus.},

Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) has been suggested as a possible explanation for this association. The purpose of this study was to determine if depression is associated with reduced HRV in patients with a recent MI. METHODS AND RESULTS Three hundred eighty acute MI patients with depression and 424 acute MI patients without depression were recruited. All underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring after hospital discharge. In univariate analyses, 4 indices of HRV were significantly lower in patients with depression than in patients without depression. Variables associated with HRV were then compared between patients with and without depression, and potential confounds were identified. These variables (age, sex, diabetes, and present cigarette smoking) were entered into an analysis of covariance model, followed by depression status. In the final model, all but one HRV index (high-frequency power) remained significantly lower in patients with depression than in patients without depression. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that greater autonomic dysfunction, as reflected by decreased HRV, is a plausible mechanism linking depression to increased cardiac mortality in post-MI patients.},

Clinical depression has also been associated with adverse outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). This study tests the hypothesis that depressed patients with CAD have decreased HR variability compared with nondepressed CAD patients. Nineteen patients with angiographically documented CAD and either major or minor depression were compared with a sample of nondepressed CAD patients according to age, sex, and smoking status. All patients underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring, and the standard deviation of all normal-to-normal intervals was used as the primary index of HR variability. HR variability was significantly lower in depressed than nondepressed patients (90 ± 35 vs 117 ± 26 ms; p {\textless} 0.01), even after adjusting for relevant covariates. Thus, decreased HR variability may help explain the increased risk for cardiac mortality and morbidity in depressed CAD patients. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Arousals from sleep are associated with increased sympathetic activation and are therefore associated with peripheral vasoconstriction. We hypothesized that digital vasoconstrictions as measured by peripheral arterial tonometery (PAT), combined with an increase in pulse rate, would accurately reflect arousals from sleep, and can provide an autonomic arousal index (AAI). Based on a previously studied group of 40 sleep apnea patients simultaneously recorded by both polysomnography (PSG) and PAT systems, an automated algorithm using the PAT signal (and pulse rate derived from it) was developed for detection of arousals from sleep. This was further validated in a separate group of 96 subjects (85 patients referred with suspected obstructive sleep apnea and 11 healthy volunteers mean age 46.2+/-14.4 years, BMI 28.5+/-5.4 kg/m2). All underwent a whole night PSG with simultaneous PAT recording. The PSG recordings were blindly manually analyzed for arousals based on American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) criteria, while PAT was scored automatically. There was a significant correlation between PSG and PAT arousals (R=0.82, p{\textless}0.0001) with a good agreement across a wide range of values, with a ROC curve having an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88. We conclude that automated analysis of the peripheral arterial tonometry signal can detect EEG arousals from sleep, in a relatively quick and reproducible fashion.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim was to evaluate differences in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, indexed by heart rate variability (HRV) in apparently healthy subjects with self-reported symptoms of pain (SRSP) within an exploratory analysis. METHODS: HRV data from 14 apparently healthy male individuals were analyzed to address potential differences in subjects with and without SRSP. SRSP was assessed using the four pain-related items from the symptom checklist (SCL-90R). Subjects were stratified based on the presence of SRSP. RESULTS: Parasympathetic activity, indexed by pNN50, RMSSD, and high frequency (HF) spectrum of HRV, was lower in subjects with SRSP. Low frequency (LF) HRV and the LF/HF ratio were greater in subjects with SRSP. However, analysis of variance revealed no significant differences between the groups. Pearson correlations showed a correlation of pNN50, HF, LF, and LF/HF ratio and the presence and frequency of SRSP. Measures of parasympathetic activity (pNN50 and HF) were inversely associated with more SRSP, indicating that subjects with more frequent SRSP show decreased parasympathetic activity. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with evidence on changes in HRV in patients with clinical conditions of chronic or recurrent pain, this is the first study to show that healthy individuals who report symptoms of pain may have lower parasympathetic activity revealed by measures of HRV.},

abstract = {Background: Recent studies have shown that depressive disorder is associated with impaired baroreceptor or baroreflex sensitivity, which is proposed to be a predisposing factor for sudden death in patients with manifest cardiac disease. These studies have not evaluated the afferent and efferent components of the cardiac baroreflex loop or other baroreflex mechanisms that regulate target processes (cardiac metabolism and blood pressure variability) related to the impairment. The objective of this study was to gain more insight into autonomic functioning in depressive disorder to more fully examine the potential basis for increased cardiac mortality. Methods: The subjects were 28 women and men with unipolar major depression who were taking antidepressant medications and who were in partial remission and free of cardiovascular or other serious disease, and 28 healthy control subjects matched for sex, age, and ethnicity. The two samples were compared for negative affective dispositions (anger expression, hostility, defensiveness, anxiety), spontaneous (closed-loop) baroreflex activity, heart rate, heart rate variability, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate-systolic blood pressure double product under resting conditions. Results: Depressed patients showed a general disposition to anger suppression coupled with higher hostility and anxiety, and lower defensiveness. The patients showed higher general sympathetic activity (high levels of blood pressure, low-frequency heart rate variability) and lower parasympathetic-related activity (high heart rate and reduced high frequency heart rate variability) with affected cardiac metabolism estimated by the double product. Depressed patients had lower baroreflex sensitivity related to a higher gain of the afferent component of the baroreflex without respective gain adjustment of its efferent component (reflex gain 'de-afferentation'). It was coupled with a compensatory higher number of effective baroreflex reactions (reflex gating 're-afferentation'). Antidepressant agents and depressed mood had additional independent effects on baroreflex sensitivity through the efferent component of the cardiac baroreflex loop. Conclusions: The data indicate that different baroreflex components and mechanisms may be impaired in patients with depression and may contribute to their increased cardiac risk. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Prodromal symptoms are often nonspecific, and even those taken to indicate ischemia (chest pain), a tachyarrhythmia (palpitations), or congestive heart failure symptoms (dys- pnea) can only be considered suggestive. For these reasons, total mortality, rather than classifications of cardiac and arrhythmic mortality, should be used as primary objectives for many outcome studies.},

abstract = {Individual differences in the cardiovascular response to stress play a central role in the reactivity hypothesis linking frequent exposure to psychosocial stress to adverse outcomes in cardiovascular health. To assess the importance of genetic factors, a meta-analysis was performed on all published twin studies that assessed heart rate (HR) or blood pressure (BP) reactivity to the cold pressor test or various mental stress tasks. For reactivity to mental stress, the pooled heritability estimate ranged from 0.26 to 0.43. Reactivity to the cold pressor test yielded heritability estimates from 0.21 to 0.55. An ensuing review of genetic association studies revealed a number of genes, mostly within the sympathoadrenal pathway, that may account for part of the heritability of cardiovascular stress reactivity. Future progress in gene finding, that should include measures of sympathetic and vagal stress reactivity, may help uncover the molecular pathways from genetic variation to stress reactivity. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Many experimental and clinical studies have confirmed a continuous cross-talk between both sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of autonomic nervous system and inflammatory response, in different clinical scenarios. In cardiovascular diseases, inflammation has been proven to play a pivotal role in disease progression, pathogenesis and resolution. A few clinical studies have assessed the possible inter-relation between neuro-autonomic output, estimated with heart rate variability analysis, which is the variability of R-R in the electrocardiogram, and different inflammatory biomarkers, in patients suffering from stable or unstable coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure. Moreover, different indices derived from heart rate signals' processing, have been proven to correlate strongly with severity of heart disease and predict final outcome. In this review article we will summarize major findings from different investigators, evaluating neuro-immunological interactions through heart rate variability analysis, in different groups of cardiovascular patients. We suggest that markers originating from variability analysis of heart rate signals seem to be related to inflammatory biomarkers. However, a lot of open questions remain to be addressed, regarding the existence of a true association between heart rate variability and autonomic nervous system output or its adoption for risk stratification and therapeutic monitoring at the bedside. Finally, potential therapeutic implications will be discussed, leading to autonomic balance restoration in relation with inflammatory control.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data on the value of baseline brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and autonomic markers in predicting heart failure (HF) hospitalization after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are limited. METHODS: A consecutive series of patients with AMI without a previous history of HF (n = 569) were followed up for 8 years. At baseline, the patients had a blood sample for determination of BNP, a 24-hour Holter recording for evaluating heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate turbulence (HRT), and an assessment of baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) using phenylephrine test. RESULTS: During the follow-up, 79 (14{\%}) patients were hospitalized due to HF. Increased baseline BNP, decreased HRV, HRT, and BRS had a significant association with HF hospitalization in univariate comparisons (P {\textless} 0.001 for all). After adjusting with all the relevant clinical parameters, BNP, HRV, and HRT still significantly predicted HF hospitalization (P {\textless} 0.001 for BNP and for the short-term scaling exponent alpha(1), P {\textless} 0.01 for turbulence slope). In the receiver operator characteristics curve analysis, the area under the curve for BNP was 0.77, for the short-term scaling exponent alpha(1) 0.69, for turbulence slope 0.71, and for BNP/standard deviation of all N-N intervals ratio 0.80. CONCLUSION: Baseline increased BNP and impaired autonomic function after AMI yield significant information on the long-term risk for HF hospitalization.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence from animal studies indicates the importance of an interaction between the sympathetic nervous system and the endothelium for cardiovascular regulation. However the interaction between these two systems remains largely unexplored in humans. The aim of this study was to investigate whether directly recorded sympathetic vasoconstrictor outflow is related to a surrogate marker of endothelial function in healthy individuals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: In 10 healthy normotensive subjects (3 f/7 m), (age 37+/-11 yrs), (BMI 24+/-3 kg/m(2)) direct recordings of sympathetic action potentials to the muscle vascular bed (MSNA) were performed and endothelial function estimated with the Reactive Hyperaemia- Peripheral Arterial Tonometry (RH-PAT) technique. Blood samples were taken and time spent on leisure-time physical activities was estimated. In all subjects the rate between resting flow and the maximum flow, the Reactive Hyperemic index (RH-PAT index), was within the normal range (1.9-3.3) and MSNA was as expected for age and gender (13-44 burst/minute). RH-PAT index was inversely related to MSNA (r = -0.8, p = 0.005). RH-PAT index and MSNA were reciprocally related to time (h/week) spent on physical activity (p = 0.005 and p = 0.006 respectively) and platelet concentration (PLT) (p = 0.02 and p = 0.004 respectively).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results show that sympathetic nerve activity is related to a surrogate marker of endothelial function in healthy normotensive individuals, indicating that sympathetic outflow may be modulated by changes in endothelial function. In this study time spent on physical activity is identified as a predictor of sympathetic nerve activity and endothelial function in a group of healthy individuals. The results are of importance in understanding mechanisms underlying sympathetic activation in conditions associated with endothelial dysfunction and emphasise the importance of a daily exercise routine for maintenance of cardiovascular health.},

abstract = {A model which assesses the closed-loop interaction between heart period (HP) and arterial pressure (AP) variabilities and the influence of respiration on both is applied to evaluate the sources of low frequency (LF approximately 0.1 Hz) and high frequency (HF, respiratory rate approximately 0.25 Hz) in conscious dogs (n = 18) and humans (n = 5). A resonance of AP closed-loop regulation is found to amplify LF oscillations. In dogs, the resonance gain increases slightly during baroreceptor unloading (mild hypotension obtained with nitroglycerine (NTG) i.v. infusion, n = 8) and coronary artery occlusion ((CAO), n = 6), and it is abolished by ganglionic transmission blockade ((ARF), Arfonad i.v. infusion, n = 3). In humans, this gain is considerably increased by passive tilt. Different, possibly central, sources of LF oscillations are also evaluated, finding a strong rhythmic modulation of HP during CAO. At HF, a direct respiratory arrhythmia is dominant in dogs at control, while it is considerably reduced during CAO. On the contrary, in humans, a strong influence of respiration on AP is shown which induces a reflex respiratory arrhythmia. An index of the gain of baroreceptive response, alpha cl, was decreased by NTG and CAO, and virtually abolished by chronic arterial baroreceptive denervation (TABD, n = 4) and ARF.},

We hypothesized that Internet-based remote interrogation systems could reduce emergency healthcare visits.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: This multicenter randomized trial involving 200 patients compared remote monitoring with standard patient management consisting of scheduled visits and patient response to audible ICD alerts. The primary end point was the rate of emergency department or urgent in-office visits for heart failure, arrhythmias, or ICD-related events. Over 16 months, such visits were 35{\%} less frequent in the remote arm (75 versus 117; incidence density, 0.59 versus 0.93 events per year; P=0.005).

abstract = {We investigated the effects of laughing and weeping induced by watching comedy and tragedy videos on mood and autonomic nervous function. Ten healthy female subjects volunteered for the experiment. Chest electrocardiogram and respiration curve were recorded before, after, and during watching a comedy or a tragedy video. We also asked them to fill out profiles of mood states (POMS) to evaluate their mood states while watching videos. Autonomic nervous function was estimated by spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). All subjects more or less laughed and wept while watching comedy and tragedy videos, respectively. Anger-hostility score of the POMS decreased and vigor score increased significantly after watching comedy videos, while depression-dejection score increased significantly after watching tragedy ones. Although both contents tended to increase a low to high frequency component ratio (LF/HF ratio) of HRV, the time course of responses was different. The LF/HF ratio which reflects cardiac sympathovagal balance increased immediately after they started watching comedy videos, and returned to the basal level right after they stopped watching, whereas the LF/HF ratio increased gradually to a lesser extent while watching tragedy videos. In contrast, the high-frequency component which reflects cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity gradually decreased while watching both videos but did not return to the basal level after watching tragedy ones. These results suggest that laughing has strong but transient effects on the autonomic nervous system, while weeping or feeling sad has moderate but sustained effects on it.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We evaluated heart rate variability biofeedback as a method for increasing vagal baroreflex gain and improving pulmonary function among 54 healthy adults. METHODS: We compared 10 sessions of biofeedback training with an uninstructed control. Cognitive and physiological effects were measured in four of the sessions. RESULTS: We found acute increases in low-frequency and total spectrum heart rate variability, and in vagal baroreflex gain, correlated with slow breathing during biofeedback periods. Increased baseline baroreflex gain also occurred across sessions in the biofeedback group, independent of respiratory changes, and peak expiratory flow increased in this group, independently of cardiovascular changes. Biofeedback was accompanied by fewer adverse relaxation side effects than the control condition. CONCLUSIONS: Heart rate variability biofeedback had strong long-term influences on resting baroreflex gain and pulmonary function. It should be examined as a method for treating cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Also, this study demonstrates neuroplasticity of the baroreflex.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of sudden cardiac death increases in populations who experience disasters such as earthquakes. The physiological link between psychological stress and sudden death is unknown; one mechanism may be the direct effects of sympathetic arousal on arrhythmias. To determine whether mental stress alters the induction, rate, or termination of ventricular arrhythmias, we performed noninvasive programmed stimulation (NIPS) in patients with defibrillators and ventricular tachycardia (VT), which is known to be inducible and terminated by antitachycardia pacing, at rest and during varying states of mental arousal. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighteen patients underwent NIPS in the resting-awake state (nonsedated). Ten underwent repeat testing during mental stress (mental arithmetic and anger recall). Induced VT was faster in 5 patients (P=0.03). VT became more difficult to terminate in 5 patients during mental stress; 4 required a shock (P=0.03). There was no change in ease of induction with mental stress. There was no evidence of ischemia on ECG or continuous ejection fraction monitoring. Eight patients received a shock in the resting-awake state and did not perform mental stress. Four underwent repeat NIPS after sedation; 3 then had induced VT terminated with antitachycardia pacing. All patients with an increase in norepinephrine of {\textgreater}50{\%} had alterations in VT that required shock for termination (P{\textless}0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Mental stress alters VT cycle length and termination without evidence of ischemia. This suggests that mental stress may lead to sudden death through the facilitation of lethal ventricular arrhythmias.},

abstract = {Accurate measurements of autonomic nerve regulation in heart failure (HF) were unresolved. The discriminating performance of deceleration and acceleration capacities of heart rate in HF was evaluated in 130 HF patients and 212 controls. Acceleration capacity and deceleration capacity were independent risk factors for HF in males, evaluated by multiple logistic regression analysis, with odds ratios (ORs) of 5.94 and 0.13, respectively. Acceleration capacity was also an independent risk factor for HF in females, with an OR of 8.58. Deceleration capacity was the best cardiac electrophysiological index to classify HF in males, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.88. Deceleration capacity was the best classification factor of HF in females with an AUC of 0.97, significantly higher than even left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Acceleration capacity also showed high performance in classifying HF in males (0.84) and females (0.92). The cut-off values of deceleration capacity for HF classification in males and females were 4.55 ms and 4.85 ms, respectively. The cut-off values of acceleration capacity for HF classification in males and females were −6.15 ms and −5.75 ms, respectively. Our study illustrates the role of acceleration and deceleration capacity measurements in the neuro-pathophysiology of HF. Heart failure (HF) refers to structural or functional impairment in the ventricular filling or ejection of blood, which may lead to fluid retention, pulmonary congestion, peripheral edema, and a complex clinical syndrome 1 . HF may be caused by disorders of the myocardium, heart valves, pericardium, and endocardium 2 . Hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and certain metabolic abnormalities are also common etiological factors of HF 3 . HF is a major challenge to public health; in the United States, there are as many as 650,000 new cases diagnosed annually, and this rate has remained stable over the past several decades 4 . The absolute mortality rate for HF is estimated to be {\~{}}50{\%} within 5 years of diagnosis 1,5 . The physiological activity of the heart is controlled and modulated by the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems 6,7 . The sympathetic nervous system has a wide variety of cardiovascular actions, including heart rate acceleration, increased cardiac contractility, reduction of venous capacitance, and constriction of resistance vessels 7,8 . The cardiovascular effects of the parasympathetic nervous system (vagus nerve) include heart rate reduction by inhibiting the sympathetic nervous system and by direct hyperpolarization of sinus nodal cells 6,9 . Disorders in parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems of the heart may coexist with serious heart conse-quences, including HF 6,9 . Dysregulation of cardiac adrenergic receptor signaling and transduction will influence cardiac inotropy and is a key feature in HF progression 7,10 . In contrast, the pathophysiological roles of normal and disordered parasympathetic innervation in heart are not as well understood 6–11 . The real-time roles of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems on the heart are difficult to monitor. However, increasing numbers of studies have shown that these roles are reflected in cardiac electro-physiology 6–11 . Heart rate variability (HRV) is the physiological phenomenon of variation in the interval between heart beats, which can be measured and calculated from a continuous electrocardiograph record 12 . In recent decades, time and frequency domain measures of HRV have been considered to represent promising markers of a significant relationship among autonomic nervous system activity, HF, and cardiovascular mortality 12,13 . Although evidence for an association between a propensity for lethal arrhythmias and signs of increased sym-pathetic or reduced vagal activity is abundant, the significance of the many different HRV indexes is more com-plex than generally appreciated, and there is potential for incorrect conclusions and for excessive or unfounded extrapolations 12 . In 2006, Baver et al. established an approach to distinguish between vagal and sympathetic nervous system roles that affect cardiac electrophysiology using a signal processing algorithm to separately characterize the decel-eration and acceleration capacities of the heart rate 14 . The deceleration and acceleration capacities of heart rate were quantified by assessing 24-h ambulatory electrocardiogram recordings 14,15 . The authors found that decreased heart rate deceleration capacity was a powerful predictor of mortality after myocardial infarction, better than left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), conventional measures of HRV, and the combination of the two 14 . Their report advanced cardiac electrophysiological analysis and provided a new approach to quantify the effects of the vagal and sympathetic nervous systems on heart physiology. Although elevated sympathetic activity is associated with an adverse prognosis, and a high level of parasym-pathetic activation confers cardioprotection 6 , a multitude of unknown questions still need to be answered. The parasympathetic actions on the heart are mediated not only by cardiac muscarinic receptor stimulation but also by many known and unknown mechanisms 6 . The role of the vagal nerve in heart biological activity has only recently been investigated in human subjects with HF. Thus, we should consider that any novel approach might advance our knowledge of cardiac nerve electrophysiology. In this report, the significance of acceleration capacity and deceleration in HF was evaluated comprehensively by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and multiple logistic regression analysis together with echocardiographic and HRV indexes under strict statistical quality con-trol. Our data provide new insights into how parasympathetic and sympathetic activation affects HF.},

abstract = {The predictive value of heart rate variability (HRV) in chronic heart failure (CHF) has never been tested in a comprehensive multivariate model using short-term laboratory recordings designed to avoid the confounding effects of respiration and behavioral factors. A multivariate survival model for the identification of sudden (presumably arrhythmic) death was developed with data from 202 consecutive patients referred between 1991 and 1995 with moderate to severe CHF (age 52±9 years, left ventricular ejection fraction 24±7{\%}, New York Heart Association class 2.3±0.7; the derivation sample). Time- and frequency-domain HRV parameters obtained from an 8′ recording of ECG at baseline and during controlled breathing (12 to 15 breaths/min) were challenged against clinical and functional parameters. This model was then validated in 242 consecutive patients referred between 1996 and 2001 (validation sample). In the derivation sample, sudden death was independently predicted by a model that included low-frequency power (LFP) of HRV during controlled breathing ≤13 ms2 and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter ≥77 mm (relative risk [RR] 3.7, 95{\%} CI 1.5 to 9.3, and RR 2.6, 95{\%} CI 1.0 to 6.3, respectively). The derivation model was also a significant predictor in the validation sample (P=0.04). In the validation sample, LFP ≤11 ms2 during controlled breathing and ≥83 ventricular premature contractions per hour on Holter monitoring were both independent predictors of sudden death (RR 3.0, 95{\%} CI 1.2 to 7.6, and RR 3.7, 95{\%} CI 1.5 to 9.0, respectively). Reduced short-term LFP during controlled breathing is a powerful predictor of sudden death in patients with CHF that is independent of many other variables. These results refine the identification of patients who may benefit from prophylactic implantation of a cardiac defibrillator.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the time course of autonomic nervous system activity preceding ambulatory ischemic events. BACKGROUND: Vagal withdrawal can produce myocardial ischemia and may be involved in the genesis of ambulatory ischemic events. We analyzed trajectories of heart rate variability (HRV) 1 h before and after ischemic events, and we examined the role of exercise and mental stress in preischemic autonomic changes. METHODS: Male patients with stable coronary artery disease (n = 19; 62.1 ± 9.3 years) underwent 48-h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Frequency domain HRV measures were assessed for 60 min before and after each of 68 ischemic events and during nonischemic heart rate-matched control periods. RESULTS: High-frequency HRV decreased from -60, -20 to -10 min before ischemic events (4.8 ± 1.3; 4.6 ± 1.3; 4.4 ± 1.2 In [ms2], respectively; p = 0.04) and further from -4, -2 min, until ischemia (4.4 ± 1.3; 4.1 ± 1.3; 3.7 ± 1.2 In [ms2]; p's {\textless} 0.01). Low frequency HRV decreases started at -4 min (p {\textless} 0.05). Ischemic events occurring at high mental activities were preceded by depressed high frequency HRV levels compared with events at low mental activity (p = 0.038 at -4 min, p = 0.045 at -2 min), whereas the effects of mental activities were not observed during nonischemic control periods. Heart rate variability measures remained significantly decreased for 20 min after recovery of ST-segment depression when events were triggered by high activity levels. CONCLUSIONS: Autonomic changes consistent with vagal withdrawal can act as a precipitating factor for daily life ischemia, particularly in episodes triggered by mental activities. {\textcopyright} 2001 by the American College of Cardiology.},

@article{Stein2006,
abstract = {The amount of time between heartbeats is controlled by the rate of depolarization of the sinoatrial node. This rate is controlled by a combination of sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs. For this reason, analysis of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) derived from intervals between normal heart beats provides insights into changing cardiac autonomic function. Increased sympathetic control of the heart from one time point to the next tends to increase HRs, decrease the amount of vagally modulated sinus arrhythmia measured as high-frequency (HF) spectral power, and increase the ratio between low-frequency (LF) spectral power and HF (the LF/HF ratio). Conversely, a shift toward greater vagal control of the heart tends to produce decreased HRs, increases in HF power, and decreases the LF/HF ratio. Clear circadian cycles of HR and HRV are seen in most subjects and correspond to periods of sleep and activity. The magnitude of these cycles is well captured by traditional HRV indices such as deviation of all normal-to-normal (NN) intervals. Cosinor analysis also provides a rough estimate of the magnitude of circadian rhythms. We have observed that HR and HRV fluctuate over time in a cyclic manner in most subjects. Although these cycles are especially prominent during the nighttime, they are seen in the daytime as well. We have developed a number of measures that quantify ultradian properties of HR/HRV cycles and would permit comparisons between subjects. We applied these measures during overnight polysomnography and have shown that ultradian rhythms of cardiac autonomic modulation have a variable and often weak correspondence with traditional sleep stages . In the current study, we applied the methodology developed for the nighttime recordings to 24-h recordings in young healthy subjects and compared these results to those obtained during the nighttime only in the same subjects and in an older group of cardiac patients. Our purpose was to explore the presenc- e and magnitude of ultradian cycles of HRV during the entire 24-h period and during sleep.},

abstract = {Background: Women have worse outcomes when they experience acute myocardial infarction (MI), but the reasons for this sex-related difference are not well understood. Because cardiovascular neural regulation plays an important role in cardiac mortality, we studied possible sex-related differences in the autonomic modulation of heart rate (HR) in middle-aged subjects without known heart disease. Methods and Results: Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and HR variability were studied in randomly selected, age- matched populations of middle-aged women (n = 186; mean age, 50 + 6 years) and men (n = 188; mean age, 50 + 6 years) without hypertension, diabetes, or clinical or echocardiographic evidence of heart disease. BRS measured from the overshoot phase of the Valsalva maneuver was significantly lower in women (8.0 + 4.6 ms/mm Hg, n = 152) than in men (10.5 + 4.6 ms/mm Hg, n = 151) (P {\textless} .001), and the low-frequency component of HR variability measured from ECG recordings also was lower in women (P {\textless} .001), whereas the high-frequency component was higher in women than in men (P {\textless} .001). The ratio between the low- and high-frequency oscillations also was lower in the women (P {\textless} .001). The increase of HR and decrease of high-frequency component of HR variability in response to an upright posture were smaller in magnitude in women than in men (P {\textless} .01 for both). After adjustment for differences in the baseline variable, such as blood pressure, HR, smoking, alcohol consumption, and psychosocial score, the sex-related differences in BRS and HR variability still remained significant (P {\textless} .001 for all). Women with estrogen replacement therapy (n = 46) had significantly higher BRS and total HR variance than the age-matched women without hormone treatment (P {\textless} .01 for both), and the BRS and HR variability of the women with estrogen therapy did not differ from those of the age-matched men. Conclusions: Baroreflex responsiveness is attenuated in middle-aged women compared with men, but the tonic vagal modulation of HR is augmented. Hormone replacement therapy appears to have favorable effects on the cardiovascular autonomic regulation in postmenopausal women.},

abstract = {Sudden cardiac death describes the unexpected natural death from a cardiac cause within a short time period, generally ?1 hour from the onset of symptoms, in a person without any prior condition that would appear fatal.1,2 Such a rapid death is often attributed to a cardiac arrhythmia, but with the advent of monitoring capabilities from implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), it is now well recognized that classifications based on clinical circumstances can be misleading and often impossible, because 40{\%} of sudden deaths can be unwitnessed.3 Only an ECG or a ventricular electrogram recorded from an implanted device at the time of death can provide definitive information about an arrhythmia. Prodromal symptoms are often nonspecific, and even those taken to indicate ischemia (chest pain), a tachyarrhythmia (palpitations), or congestive heart failure symptoms (dys- pnea) can only be considered suggestive. For these reasons, total mortality, rather than classifications of cardiac and arrhythmic mortality, should be used as primary objectives for many outcome studies.},

abstract = {Although the sympathetic nervous system innervates the lung, little is known about its participation in host immunity to pulmonary pathogens. In this study, we show that peripheral sympathectomy reduces mouse morbidity and mortality from influenza A virus-induced pneumonia due to reduced inflammatory influx of monocytes, neutrophils, and NK cells. Mortality was also delayed by treating mice with an alpha-adrenergic antagonist. Sympathectomy diminished the immediate innate cytokine responses, particularly IL-1, which was profoundly reduced. These findings demonstrate an unexpected role for the sympathetic nervous system in innate antiviral immunity and in exacerbating the pathology of a virus of great significance to human and animal health.},

In the inflammatory reflex, sensory input elicited by infection or injury travels through the afferent vagus nerve to integrative regions in the brainstem, and efferent nerves carry outbound signals that terminate in the spleen and other tissues. Neurotransmitters from peripheral autonomic nerves subsequently promote acetylcholine-release from a subset of CD4 + T cells that relay the neural signal to other immune cells, e.g. through activation of a7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on macrophages. Here, we review recent progress in the understanding of the inflammatory reflex and dis-cuss potential therapeutic implications of current findings in this evolving field.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dynamic analysis techniques may quantify abnormalities in heart rate variability (HRV) based on nonlinear and fractal analysis (chaos theory). The article emphasizes clinical and prognostic significance of dynamic changes in short-time series applied on patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) during the exercise electrocardiograph (ECG) test. METHODS: The subjects were included in the series after complete cardiovascular diagnostic data. Series of R-R and ST-T intervals were obtained from exercise ECG data after sampling digitally. The range rescaled analysis method determined the fractal dimension of the intervals. To quantify fractal long-range correlation's properties of heart rate variability, the detrended fluctuation analysis technique was used. Approximate entropy (ApEn) was applied to quantify the regularity and complexity of time series, as well as unpredictability of fluctuations in time series. RESULTS: It was found that the short-term fractal scaling exponent (alpha(1)) is significantly lower in patients with CHD (0.93 +/- 0.07 vs 1.09 +/- 0.04; P {\textless} 0.001). The patients with CHD had higher fractal dimension in each exercise test program separately, as well as in exercise program at all. ApEn was significant lower in CHD group in both RR and ST-T ECG intervals (P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The nonlinear dynamic methods could have clinical and prognostic applicability also in short-time ECG series. Dynamic analysis based on chaos theory during the exercise ECG test point out the multifractal time series in CHD patients who loss normal fractal characteristics and regularity in HRV. Nonlinear analysis technique may complement traditional ECG analysis.},

abstract = {We investigated the effects of laughing and weeping induced by watching comedy and tragedy videos on mood and autonomic nervous function. Ten healthy female subjects volunteered for the experiment. Chest electrocardiogram and respiration curve were recorded before, after, and during watching a comedy or a tragedy video. We also asked them to fill out profiles of mood states (POMS) to evaluate their mood states while watching videos. Autonomic nervous function was estimated by spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). All subjects more or less laughed and wept while watching comedy and tragedy videos, respectively. Anger-hostility score of the POMS decreased and vigor score increased significantly after watching comedy videos, while depression-dejection score increased significantly after watching tragedy ones. Although both contents tended to increase a low to high frequency component ratio (LF/HF ratio) of HRV, the time course of responses was different. The LF/HF ratio which reflects cardiac sympathovagal balance increased immediately after they started watching comedy videos, and returned to the basal level right after they stopped watching, whereas the LF/HF ratio increased gradually to a lesser extent while watching tragedy videos. In contrast, the high-frequency component which reflects cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity gradually decreased while watching both videos but did not return to the basal level after watching tragedy ones. These results suggest that laughing has strong but transient effects on the autonomic nervous system, while weeping or feeling sad has moderate but sustained effects on it.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis has emerged as an important research topic to evaluate autonomic cardiac function. However, traditional time and frequency-domain analysis characterizes and quantify only linear and stationary phenomena. In the present investigation, we made a comparative analysis of three alternative approaches (i.e., wavelet multifractal analysis, Lyapunov exponents and multiscale entropy analysis) for quantifying nonlinear dynamics in heart rate time series. Note that these extracted nonlinear features provide information about nonlinear scaling behaviors and the complexity of cardiac systems. To evaluate the performance, we used 24-hour HRV recordings from 54 healthy subjects and 29 heart failure patients, available in PhysioNet. Three nonlinear methods are evaluated not only individually but also in combination using three classification algorithms, i.e., linear discriminate analysis, quadratic discriminate analysis and k-nearest neighbors. Experimental results show that three nonlinear methods capture nonlinear dynamics from different perspectives and the combined feature set achieves the best performance, i.e., sensitivity 97.7{\%} and specificity 91.5{\%}. Collectively, nonlinear HRV features are shown to have the promise to identify the disorders in autonomic cardiovascular function.},

abstract = {3 tobacco cigarettes with known content of nicotine and 1 lettuce-leaf cigarette were smoked by 24 paid, male medical students who were habitual smokers, at different times of day and at fixed rates of smoking. Changes in psychophysiological parameters were automatically recorded during the 60 min which followed smoking. Heart rate and forearm blood flow increases were dose dependent, the latter occurring only after smoking at the fast rate. Skin vasoconstriction, as measured by decreases in temperature, was more reactive to environmental stimuli than to drug effects. Significant increases in skin conductance levels lasting throughout the experimental session occurred immediately after smoking. Diphasic effects of nicotine were obtained with the 2 largest doses at different times of day. This finding is discussed in relation to possible unspecific nicotine effects upon a preexisting level of activation. Nicotine did not influence subjective time estimates. This is discussed in terms of disruption of the timing task and a gradual reorganization towards presmoking estimates. (32 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Power spectrum analysis of cardiovascular signal variability, and in particular of the RR period (heart rate variability, HRV), is a widely used methodology for investigating autonomic neural regulation in health and disease that can quantify the sympathovagal balance modulating the sinus node pacemaker. In some cases, it can also quantify the neural regulation of other organs or apparatuses. However, use of the correct methodology is crucial to extract the information embedded in the frequency domain. In numerous abnormal conditions, such as essential arterial hypertension, acute myocardial infarction and heart failure, the sympathovagal balance may be altered in basal conditions. However, a reduced responsiveness to an excitatory stimulus is the most common feature that characterizes numerous pathophysiological states. The attenuation of an oscillatory pattern can also reflect an altered target function, thus providing important prognostic markers. The general features of this approach correspond well to the needs of an internist attempting to envisage the involvement of the whole organism in a disease process. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {RATIONALE: Studies of the genetics of obstructive sleep apnea may be facilitated by identifying intermediate traits with high heritability that quantify etiological pathways, such as those related to respiratory control. Electrocardiogram (ECG)-based sleep spectrograms, measuring the coupling between respiratory modulation of ECG QRS-wave amplitude and heart rate variability, may provide measures of sleep state and ventilatory dynamics during sleep. We evaluated the familial aggregation of distinctive spectrographic biomarkers of unstable sleep, related to elevated-low frequency cardiopulmonary coupling (e-LFC), to assess their utility in genetic studies. METHODS: 622 participants from 137 families from the Cleveland Family Study underwent standardized polysomnography (PSG). From the ECG signal on the PSG, the interbeat interval time series and the corresponding ECG-derived respiratory signal were extracted, and the low frequency (0.01-0.1 Hz) component of their coupling was computed using a fully automated method. Narrow sense heritability of e-LFC was calculated using variance component methods. RESULTS: A spectral marker of abnormal low frequency cardiopulmonary coupling (e-LFC) demonstrated moderate correlation with apnea hypopnea index (AHI; r = 0.35, P {\{}{\textless}{\}} 0.0001). The heritability estimate for e-LFC, after adjusting for age and sex was 0.32 (P {\{}{\textless}{\}} 10-5) and remained unchanged after additionally adjusting for body mass index or AHI. In biological relatives of those with sleep apnea, a related marker of e-LFC was more prevalent than in controls (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 30{\{}{\%}{\}} of the variability of e-LFC, measured from a continuous ECG during sleep, is explained by familial factors other than BMI. ECG-based spectrographic measures of cardiopulmonary coupling may provide novel phenotypes for characterizing subgroups of individuals with different propensities and genetic etiologies for sleep apnea or for other conditions associated with sleep fragmentation.},

abstract = {Background Noradrenergic function has been linked to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and might have a role in mediating sleep disturbances of the disorder. Our objective was to relate a peripheral manifestation of noradrenergic function, sympathetic nervous system activity as indexed by heart rate variability during sleep, to the development of PTSD in subjects with recent traumatic injuries. Methods Subjects who had recall of life-threatening experiences were recruited from one of two regional trauma centers. Select subjects received a polysomnographic recording within 1 month of the trauma. Digitized electrocardiogram recordings were extracted from early and late rapid-eye-movement (REM) and preceding non-REM sleep periods. Autoregression was applied to R-R interval time series to calculate the ratios of low-frequency to high-frequency spectral densities (LF/HF ratios), which index sympathetic activation. Posttraumatic stress disorder status was determined at 2 months. Results There was a significant state × group interaction: LF/HF ratios were higher during the REM sleep of the nine subjects who were positive for PTSD symptoms, compared with the 10 subjects who were PTSD negative. Conclusions Our findings are consistent with the possibility that increased noradrenergic activity during REM sleep contributes to the development of PTSD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mental stress is associated with sympathetic adrenergic stimulation and concomitant increases in blood pressure and heart rate. Heritable individual differences in cardiovascular functional response to mental stress may arise from genetic variations in adrenergic receptors, which might produce excessive hemodynamic response to mental stress or create other conditions favoring the development of myocardial ischemia. METHODS: We examined the relationship between hemodynamic response to mental stress and mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) and 5 common functional polymorphisms of beta1-adrenergic receptors (ADRB1 [OMIM 109630, accession No. 153]) and beta2-adrenergic receptors (ADRB2 [OMIM 109690, accession No. 154]). Participants were 148 patients (45 female [30.4{\%}]) with a documented history of coronary artery disease and a mean (SD) age of 64 (9) years. Patients were enrolled between December 9, 2004, and February 21, 2007. Mental stress was induced via a public-speaking task. Rest and stress myocardial perfusion imaging was performed. Blood samples were collected and genotyped for 5 common functional polymorphisms of ADRB1 (codons 49 and 389) and ADRB2 (codons 16 and 27 and nucleotide 523). The main outcome measures were hemodynamic and myocardial ischemic responses to mental stress. Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia was defined as new or worsening perfusion defects during mental stress with a summed (stress to rest) difference score of at least 3. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was noted in the prevalences of MSIMI between genotype groups for codon 49 of ADRB1. Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia occurred 3 times more frequently among patients homozygous for the Ser49 allele (31 of 104 patients [29.8{\%}]) compared with 4 of 39 patients (10.3{\%}) among the Gly49 allele carriers (P=.02). The adjusted odds ratio for the effect of genotype (Ser/Ser vs Gly carriers) on MSIMI was 3.9 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.2-12.5) (P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate an association between a common genetic variation in ADRB1 and myocardial ischemic response to mental stress in patients with coronary artery disease. This polymorphic genetic marker may help identify patients at increased risk for mental stress-induced adverse outcomes.},

@article{Blechert2007,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and panic disorder (PD) are two anxiety disorders with prominent psychophysiological symptoms. The PTSD criterion of persistent hyperarousal suggests autonomic dysregulation, and the disorder has been associated with elevated heart rate. In contrast, PD has been associated with respiratory abnormalities such as low end-tidal Pco(2). An integrated analysis of automatic and respiratory function in a direct comparison of these anxiety disorders is currently lacking. METHODS: Electrodermal, cardiovascular, and respiratory psychophysiology was examined in 23 PTSD patients, 26 PD patients, and 32 healthy individuals at baseline and during threat of shock. RESULTS: At baseline, the PTSD patients, in contrast to the other two groups, were characterized by attenuated parasympathetic and elevated sympathetic control, as evidenced by low respiratory sinus arrhythmia (a measure of cardiac vagal control) and high electrodermal activity. They also displayed elevated heart rate and cardiovascular sympathetic activation in comparison with healthy controls. PD patients exhibited lower Pco(2) (hypocapnia) and higher cardiovascular sympathetic activation compared with healthy controls. PTSD patients, but not PD patients, sighed more frequently than controls. During the threat of shock phase, the PTSD group demonstrated blunted electrodermal responses. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent hyperarousal symptoms in PTSD seem to be due to high sympathetic activity coupled with low parasympathetic cardiac control. Respiratory abnormalities were also present in PTSD. Several psychophysiological measures exhibited group-comparison effect sizes in the order of 1.0, supporting their potential for enhancing differential diagnosis and possibly suggesting utility as endophenotypes in genetic studies of anxiety disorders.},

A resonance of AP closed-loop regulation is found to amplify LF oscillations. In dogs, the resonance gain increases slightly during baroreceptor unloading (mild hypotension obtained with nitroglycerine (NTG) i.v. infusion, n = 8) and coronary artery occlusion ((CAO), n = 6), and it is abolished by ganglionic transmission blockade ((ARF), Arfonad i.v. infusion, n = 3). In humans, this gain is considerably increased by passive tilt. Different, possibly central, sources of LF oscillations are also evaluated, finding a strong rhythmic modulation of HP during CAO. At HF, a direct respiratory arrhythmia is dominant in dogs at control, while it is considerably reduced during CAO. On the contrary, in humans, a strong influence of respiration on AP is shown which induces a reflex respiratory arrhythmia. An index of the gain of baroreceptive response, alpha cl, was decreased by NTG and CAO, and virtually abolished by chronic arterial baroreceptive denervation (TABD, n = 4) and ARF.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether interindividual variation in parasympathetic (cholinergic) and sympathetic (adrenergic) regulation of heart rate (as estimated by frequency components of heart rate variability [HRV]) may be accounted for, in part, by genetic variation in the choline transporter, a component of acetylcholine neurotransmission. METHODS: Resting HRV estimates of high- (HF) and low-frequency (LF) power and LF/HF ratio were determined from electrocardiogram recordings collected continuously over 5 minutes in 413 white individuals of European ancestry (49{\{}{\%}{\}} men; aged 30-54 years [mean, 44 years]). Subjects were genotyped for a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the 3' untranslated region of the choline transporter gene (CHT1). Frequencies of the alternate CHT1 alleles, labeled G and T, were 76{\{}{\%}{\}} and 24{\{}{\%}{\}}. RESULTS: Compared with GG homozygotes, participants having any T allele had greater HF power (p {\{}{\textless}{\}}.02), lower LF power (p {\{}{\textless}{\}}.02), and lower LF/HF ratios (p {\{}{\textless}{\}}.005). Relative to men, women had lower LF power (p {\{}{\textless}{\}}.001) and lower LF/HF ratios (p {\{}{\textless}{\}}.005). CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that polymorphic variation in the CHT1 gene is associated significantly with interindividual variability in HRV indices related to parasympathetic (cholinergic) activity.},

abstract = {Background: Studies have linked depression to sudden death and serious cardiovascular events in patients with preexisting cardiac illness. Recent studies have shown decreased vagal function in cardiac patients with depression and depressed patients without cardiac illness. Methods: We compared 20-hour, sleeping, and awake heart period variability measures using spectral analysis, fractal dimension, and symbolic dynamics in two patient groups with major depression and ischemic heart disease (mean age 59-60 years) before and after 6 weeks of paroxetine or nortriptyline treatment. Results: Spectral measures showed decreases in awake and sleeping total power (TP: 0.0-0.5 Hz), ultra low frequency power (ULF: 0-0.0033 Hz), very low frequency power (VLF: 0.0033-0.04 Hz), and low-frequency power (LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz) for nortriptyline condition and a decrease in high-frequency power (HF: 0.15-0.5 Hz) for the awake condition in patients who received nortriptyline. A measure of nonlinear complexity, WC-100, significantly increased after paroxetine during the awake condition. Conclusions: These findings suggest that nortriptyline has stronger vagolytic effects on cardiac autonomic function compared with paroxetine, which is in agreement with previous clinical and preclinical reports. Paroxetine may have some cardio-protective effects, especially in cardiac patients.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) has been shown to be attenuated in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and may, therefore, be possibly used for the early detection of myocardial ischemia. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic yield of a novel short-term HRV algorithm for the detection of myocardial ischemia in subjects without known CAD. We prospectively enrolled 450 subjects without known CAD who were referred to tertiary medical centers for exercise stress testing (EST) with single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). All subjects underwent 1-hour Holter testing with subsequent HRV analysis before EST with MPI. The diagnostic yield of HRV analysis was compared with EST, using MPI as the gold standard for the noninvasive detection of myocardial ischemia. All subjects had intermediate pretest probability for CAD. Mean age was 62 years, 38{\%} were women, 51{\%} had hypertension, and 25{\%} diabetes mellitus. HRV analysis showed superior sensitivity (77{\%}) compared with standard EST (27{\%}). After multivariate adjustment, HRV was independently associated with an 8.4-fold (p {\textless}0.001) increased likelihood for the detection of myocardial ischemia by MPI, whereas EST did not show a statistically significant association with a positive MPI (odds ratio 2.1; p = 0.12). Of subjects who were referred for subsequent coronary angiography, the respective sensitivities of HRV and EST for the detection of significant CAD were 73{\%} versus 26{\%}. Our data suggest that HRV can be used as an important noninvasive technique for the detection of myocardial ischemia in subjects without known CAD, providing superior sensitivity to conventional EST in this population.},

abstract = {Background: Depression is associated with increased risk of death among patients with coronary disease. Cardiovascular autonomic dysregulation may be one of the mechanisms by which depression exerts its effects on cardiovascular function. The purpose of this study was to determine whether depressive symptoms are associated with low heart rate variability (HRV) and prolonged HR recovery after exercise testing in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods: The Psychophysiological Investigation of Myocardial Ischemia (PIMI) was a large, multicenter study designed to assess psychological and physiological correlates of stress in patients with CAD. One hundred and eighty-eight patients with CAD as evidenced by at least 50{\%} blockage of one major artery and a previous positive exercise stress test were included in this study. Patients included in this report were not taking beta blockers. Cardiovascular functioning was assessed by a modified Bruce protocol treadmill stress test. Measures of psychological functioning, including the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), were also obtained. Results: BDI scores were negatively correlated with HR recovery (r = -0.15, p = .04). Depression scores accounted for 3.5{\%} of the variance in HR recovery when controlling for participant age (p {\textless} .01). Depressive symptoms were related to two HRV indices (ultra-low frequency, high frequency). Conclusions: Depressive symptoms are associated with cardiovascular autonomic nervous system dysfunction as assessed by HR recovery. This relationship is not merely due to an association of depression severity with beta blocker usage or a failure of depressed patients to achieve an adequate chronotropic response.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the present paper, we describe a model of neurovisceral integration in which a set of neural structures involved in cognitive, affective, and autonomic regulation are related to heart rate variability (HRV) and cognitive performance. METHODS: We detail the pathways involved in the neural regulation of the cardiovascular system and provide pharmacological and neuroimaging data in support of the neural structures linking the central nervous system to HRV in humans. We review a number of studies from our group showing that individual differences in HRV are related to performance on tasks associated with executive function and prefrontal cortical activity. These studies include comparisons of executive- and nonexecutive-function tasks in healthy participants, in both threatening and nonthreatening conditions. In addition, we show that manipulating resting HRV levels is associated with changes in performance on executive-function tasks. We also examine the relationship between HRV and cognitive performance in ecologically valid situations using a police shooting simulation and a naval navigation simulation. Finally, we review our studies in anxiety patients, as well as studies examining psychopathy. CONCLUSION: These findings in total suggest an important relationship among cognitive performance, HRV, and prefrontal neural function that has important implications for both physical and mental health. Future studies are needed to determine exactly which executive functions are associated with individual differences in HRV in a wider range of situations and populations.},

abstract = {There is growing evidence that rumination, perhaps specifically brooding rumination, is a core feature of depression and that it contributes to the development and maintenance of the disorder. A separate line of research has highlighted the role played by heart rate variability (HRV). Both brooding rumination and HRV appear to be driven by disruption in the same neural circuit, heightened amygdala reactivity combined with decreased prefrontal control, and both are highlighted in different units of analysis as reflecting the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) construct of Loss. However, little is known about the relation among these variables. In the current study, we predicted that higher levels of brooding rumination would be associated with lower levels of HRV and that women at high risk for future depression (i.e., those with a history of past major depressive disorder [MDD]) would exhibit higher levels of brooding and lower levels of HRV. We also examined genetic influences on the variables in this model. We predicted that COMT Val158Met genotype, which has been linked to heightened amygdala reactivity and deficits in prefrontal functioning, would be associated with brooding rumination and HRV, particularly among women with a history of past MDD. The results largely supported our hypotheses, providing additional support for relations among the different units of analysis for the Loss construct.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Information is limited about the independent prognostic value of repolarization abnormalities in women. METHODS AND RESULTS We evaluated hazard ratios for ECG variables for combined fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease (CHD) events and for CHD mortality using Cox regression in 38,283 Women's Health Initiative (WHI) participants during up to 9.2 years of follow-up. All risk models were adjusted for demographic, clinical, and therapeutic variables. Evaluated as single ECG variables, wide QRS/T angle and ECG-demonstrated myocardial infarction (ECG-MI) were the strongest predictors of CHD events, with hazard ratios (95{\%} CI) of 1.90 (1.50 to 2.42) and 1.62 (1.29 to 2.03), respectively. Six other repolarization variables were also significant, strong predictors of CHD events. Wide QRS/T angle, ECG-MI, and QT prolongation appeared as dominant predictors when evaluated simultaneously with other ECG variables in a multiadjusted risk model. QRS/T angle, ECG-MI, and high QRS nondipolar voltage were the strongest predictors of CHD mortality, with hazard ratios of 2.70, 2.41, and 2.18, respectively. The risk increase ranged from 63{\%} to 95{\%} for the other 4 significant predictors. Five ECG abnormalities were identified as dominant mortality risk predictors: wide QRS/T angle, ECG-MI, high QRS nondipolar voltage, reduced heart rate variability, and QT prolongation (in the cardiovascular disease-free group only). CONCLUSIONS Ventricular repolarization abnormalities in postmenopausal women are as important predictors of CHD events and CHD mortality as ECG-MI and other QRS abnormalities. Repolarization variables and QRS nondipolar voltage warrant attention in future investigations.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between polymorphic variation in alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor genes and cardiovascular activity at rest and in response to psychological challenge in a sample in which the heritability of these cardiovascular phenotypes may be established. METHODS: Several common polymorphisms were characterized within ADRA1B (alpha1B), ADRA2A (alpha2A), ADRB1 (beta1) and ADRB2 (beta2) and examined in relation to heart rate (HR) and systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, both at rest and in response to stress. Participants were 309 European-American, young adult men and women (including 101 monozygotic and 44 dizygotic twin pairs). RESULTS: In the full sample, participants carrying any G allele at base pair (bp) 1165 in ADRB1 exhibited elevated resting SBP and DBP and a larger DBP response to mental challenge compared to homozygotes for the C allele (P {\textless} 0.04). An AA genotype at bp 145 in ADRB1 was also associated with higher resting SBP and DBP than AG or GG genotypes (P {\textless} 0.03). At bp 46 in ADRB2, GG homozygotes had higher resting DBP than subjects possessing any A allele (P {\textless} 0.05). For the same polymorphism, however, AG heterozygotes showed lower SBP than both AA and GG homozygotes (P {\textless} 0.05). In a subsample of genetically unrelated individuals, ADRB1 (1165) continued to predict resting SBP, DBP and DBP response to stress (P {\textless} 0.03), while ADRB2 (46) was associated with resting SBP (P {\textless} 0.04) but not DBP. Finally, the degree of allele sharing at ADRB1 (1165) also predicted variability in SBP and DBP at rest among dizygotic twin pairs (P {\textless} 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that some polymorphic variation within adrenoreceptor genes contributes to interindividual variability in resting SBP and DBP and in DBP response to mental challenge.},

Recently, rapid development has occurred in the clinical assessment of autonomic function. Various procedures have been described as diagnostic tools to monitor autonomic dysfunction. Some of them are mostly used for research purposes. Many, however, have found their place in routine clinical evaluation. Our paper presents selected methods of assessment of the autonomic nervous system with particular emphasis on those that are useful in diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the cardiovascular system. We discuss multiple tests based on cardiovascular reflexes, methods of studying heart rate variability as well as direct catecholamine measurements. Moreover, we outline tests of sudomotor function and microneurography.},

abstract = {The vagal (high frequency [HF]) component of heart rate variability (HRV) predicts survival in post-myocardial infarction patients and is considered to reflect vagal antagonism of sympathetic influences. Previous studies of the neural correlates of vagal tone involved mental stress tasks that included cognitive and emotional elements. To differentiate the neural substrates of vagal tone due to emotion, we correlated HF-HRV with measures of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) derived from positron emission tomography (PET) and15O-water in 12 healthy women during different emotional states. Happiness, sadness, disgust and three neutral conditions were each induced by film clips and recall of personal experiences (12 conditions). Inter-beat intervals derived from electrocardiographic recordings during the 60-second scans were spectrally-analyzed, generating 12 separate measures of HF-HRV in each subject. The six emotion and six neutral conditions were grouped together and contrasted. We observed substantial overlap between emotion-specific rCBF and the correlation between emotion-specific rCBF and HF-HRV, particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex. Emotion-specific rCBF also correlated with HF-HRV in the caudate nucleus, periacqueductal gray and left mid-insula. We also observed that the elements of cognitive control inherent in this experiment (that involved focusing on the target mental state) had definable neural substrates that correlated with HF-HRV and to a large extent differed from the emotion-specific correlates of HF-HRV. No statistically significant asymmetries were observed. Our findings are consistent with the view that the medial visceromotor network is a final common pathway by which emotional and cognitive functions recruit autonomic support. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine in a nonclinical sample of preadolescents the possibility that somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms are differentially related with the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Depression is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Dysregulation of the ANS and the HPA axis have been proposed as underlying mechanisms. Several studies suggest that only a subset of the depression symptoms account for associations with cardiovascular prognosis. METHODS: Self-reported somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms were examined in relationship to heart rate variability (HRV), spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), and the cortisol awakening response (CAR) in 2049 preadolescents (mean age = 11.1 years; 50.7{\%} = girls) from the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS). RESULTS: Physiological measurements were not associated with the overall measure of depressive symptoms. Somatic depressive symptoms were negatively related to HRV and BRS, and positively to the CAR; cognitive-affective depressive symptoms were positively related to HRV and BRS, and negatively to the CAR. Associations with the CAR pertained to boys only. CONCLUSIONS: Somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms differ in their association with both cardiac autonomic and HPA axis function in preadolescents. Particularly, somatic depression symptoms may mark cardiac risk.},

All the measurements were significantly reduced in the feet of patients with neuropathy. Vasoconstrictor responses were not significantly impaired in the hands of these patients. Cardiovascular autonomic function was assessed in the same subjects by standard tests of reflex heart rate responses and compared to sympathetic vasoconstrictor function as determined by the response to a deep breath. Eighteen of the 30 diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy had impairment of both cardiovascular and sympathetic vasoconstrictor function. Five had normal vasoconstrictor but impaired cardiovascular responses and two had normal cardiovascular but impaired vasoconstrictor function.

abstract = {Background: Women have worse outcomes when they experience acute myocardial infarction (MI), but the reasons for this sex-related difference are not well understood. Because cardiovascular neural regulation plays an important role in cardiac mortality, we studied possible sex-related differences in the autonomic modulation of heart rate (HR) in middle-aged subjects without known heart disease. Methods and Results: Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and HR variability were studied in randomly selected, age- matched populations of middle-aged women (n = 186; mean age, 50 + 6 years) and men (n = 188; mean age, 50 + 6 years) without hypertension, diabetes, or clinical or echocardiographic evidence of heart disease. BRS measured from the overshoot phase of the Valsalva maneuver was significantly lower in women (8.0 + 4.6 ms/mm Hg, n = 152) than in men (10.5 + 4.6 ms/mm Hg, n = 151) (P {\textless} .001), and the low-frequency component of HR variability measured from ECG recordings also was lower in women (P {\textless} .001), whereas the high-frequency component was higher in women than in men (P {\textless} .001). The ratio between the low- and high-frequency oscillations also was lower in the women (P {\textless} .001). The increase of HR and decrease of high-frequency component of HR variability in response to an upright posture were smaller in magnitude in women than in men (P {\textless} .01 for both). After adjustment for differences in the baseline variable, such as blood pressure, HR, smoking, alcohol consumption, and psychosocial score, the sex-related differences in BRS and HR variability still remained significant (P {\textless} .001 for all). Women with estrogen replacement therapy (n = 46) had significantly higher BRS and total HR variance than the age-matched women without hormone treatment (P {\textless} .01 for both), and the BRS and HR variability of the women with estrogen therapy did not differ from those of the age-matched men. Conclusions: Baroreflex responsiveness is attenuated in middle-aged women compared with men, but the tonic vagal modulation of HR is augmented. Hormone replacement therapy appears to have favorable effects on the cardiovascular autonomic regulation in postmenopausal women.},

HRV indices, determined in either the time or frequency domain, are closely related and reflect parasympathetic, mixed sympathetic, and parasympathetic and circadian rhythms. In population studies, decreased HRV has had predictive value for mortality among healthy adults. It is a well-established risk factor for arrhythmic events and mortality among post-myocardial-infarction patients but has only moderate sensitivity and specificity. Decreased HRV has had mixed predictive success in congestive heart failure. Reduced HRV identifies diabetic patients with autonomic neuropathy. HRV in combination with other risk stratifiers, e.g. ejection fraction, can identify cardiac patients at especially high risk of mortality. Many but not all interventions associated with increased HRV are also associated with better survival rates.},

abstract = {Aims: The ATRAMI (Autonomic Tone and Reflexes After Myocardial Infarction) study has proved the independent prognostic value of baroreflex sensitivity. A limitation of the traditional method of estimating baroreflex sensitivity by phenylephrine, is the need to monitor intra-arterial blood pressure. Our objective was to establish whether this invasive method of monitoring could be superseded by non-invasive methods, such as the Finapres device. Methods and Results: Patients with three repeated invasive and non-invasive baroreflex sensitivity measurements were selected from the ATRAMI database (n=454). The mean of these measurements was taken as the baroreflex sensitivity estimate. The repeatability of both methods (standard deviation of the three measurements) decreased with increasing baroreflex sensitivity. There was no constant bias between invasive and non-invasive measurements (0.22 ± 2.2 ms . mmHg-1, P=0.42). The linear correlation was very high (r=0.91, P{\textless}0.01). The normalized 95{\%} limits of agreement were -0.5 and 0.52. On survival analysis, invasive and non-invasive baroreflex sensitivity gave similar prognostic information (likelihood ratio: 155.6 (P=0.007) and 155.0 (P=0.006); risk ratio: 0.79 and 0.81, respectively). According to the ATRAMI cut-off points, 85{\%} of patients were classified concordantly by the two methods. None of the patients at high (low) risk with the invasive method were classified as low (high) risk class by the non-invasive method. Conclusion: Despite wide limits of agreement, invasive and non-invasive baroreflex sensitivity measurements are highly correlated and provide equivalent prognostic information.

abstract = {Abnormal serotonin transporter (5-HTT) function and autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation has been proposed in panic disorder. However, in contrast to hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) functioning, ANS reactivity during panic response has yet not been investigated in humans with respect to the 5-HTT genotype. The present study assessed the influence of challenging by cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) on heart rate variability (HRV) measures, to monitor autonomic reactivity and its relationship to 5-HTT-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) genotypes. We hypothesized substantial effects of the 5-HTTLPR genotype on autonomic reactivity. We studied 30 healthy young men, 15 of each with the long/long (l/l) or short/short (s/s) genotype for the 5-HTTLPR. All participants received an intravenous application of 50$\mu$g CCK-4. HRV measures were assessed in both groups at baseline and immediately after CCK-4 application. Our results indicated lower parasympathetic activity in s/s carriers during baseline, time and frequency domain measures. CCK-4 application significantly enhanced the sympathetic tone in both groups, leading to diminished group differences. A significant treatment by genotype effect indicated reduced autonomic reactivity to CCK-4 challenge in the s/s compared to l/l carriers. Our findings show enhanced sympathetic and/or diminished cardiac vagal activity under basal conditions and blunted autonomic reactivity in s/s vs. l/l carriers. Our study provides novel data supporting claims that the s/s genotype represents a genetic vulnerability factor associated with inadequate hyporeactivity to stress and extends current knowledge on the impact of the central serotonergic activity on the sympathoadrenal pathway. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Recent studies have found a significant association between PTSD and low heart rate variability (HRV), a biomarker of autonomic dysregulation. Research indicates that respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) biofeedback increases HRV while reducing related pathological symptoms. This controlled pilot study compared RSA biofeedback to progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) as adjunctive interventions for 38 persons with PTSD symptoms in a residential treatment facility for a substance use disorder. Both groups were assessed at pre-intervention and 4-week post-intervention. Group × time interactions revealed significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms and increases in HRV indices for the RSA group. Both groups significantly reduced PTSD and insomnia symptoms and a statistical trend was observed for reduced substance craving for the RSA group. Increases in HRV were significantly associated with PTSD symptom reduction. Overall, these results provide preliminary support for the efficacy of RSA biofeedback in improving physiological and psychological health for individuals with PTSD. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Trauma is associated with increased risk for anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To further understand biologic mechanisms of PTSD, we examined the dark-enhanced startle response, a psychophysiological correlate of anxiety, and heart rate variability (HRV) in traumatized individuals with and without PTSD. The associations of these measures with PTSD may be sex-specific because of their associations with the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, a sexually dimorphic brain structure in the limbic system that is approximately 2.5 times larger in men than in women.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The study sample (N = 141) was recruited from a highly traumatized civilian population seeking treatment at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. Psychophysiological responses during a dark-enhanced startle paradigm task included startle magnitude, assessed by eyeblink reflex, and measures of high-frequency HRV, during light and dark phases of the startle session.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The startle magnitude was higher during the dark phase than the light phase (mean ± standard error = 98.61 ± 10.68 versus 73.93 ± 8.21 $\mu$V, p {\textless} .001). PTSD was associated with a greater degree of dark-enhanced startle in women (p = .03) but not in men (p = .38, p interaction = .48). Although HRV measures did not differ between phases, high-frequency HRV was greater in men with PTSD compared with men without PTSD (p = .02).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the dark-enhanced paradigm provides novel insights into the psychophysiological responses associated with PTSD in traumatized civilian sample. Sex differences in altered parasympathetic and sympathetic function during anxiety regulation tasks may provide further insight into the neurobiological mechanisms of PTSD.},

abstract = {Low heart rate (HR) variability is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but the causes and mechanisms of this association are not well known. This prospective study was designed to test the hypothesis that reduced HR variability is related to progression of coronary atherosclerosis. Average HR and HR variability were analyzed in 12-hour ambulatory ECG recordings from 265 qualified patients participating in a multicenter study to evaluate the angiographic progression of coronary artery disease in patients with prior coronary artery bypass surgery and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations ({\textless}1.1 mmol/L). Participants were randomized to receive a placebo or gemfibrozil therapy. The progression of coronary atherosclerosis was estimated by quantitative, computer-assisted analysis of coronary artery stenoses from the baseline angiograms and from repeated angiograms performed an average of 32 months later. The progression of focal coronary atherosclerosis of the patients randomized to placebo therapy was more marked in the tertile with the lowest standard deviation of all normal to normal R-R intervals (SDNN, 74+/-13 ms; mean decrease in the per-patient minimum luminal diameter -0.17 mm; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], -0.23 to -0.12 mm) than in the middle tertile (SDNN, 107+/-7 ms; mean decrease -0.05 mm; 95{\%} CI, -0.08 to -0.01 mm) or highest tertile (SDNN, 145+/-25 ms; mean change 0.01 mm; 95{\%} CI, -0. 04 to 0.02 mm) (P{\textless}0.001 between the tertiles). This association was abolished by gemfibrozil. SDNN was lower (P{\textless}0.001) and minimum HR was faster (P{\textless}0.01) in the patients with marked progression than in those with regression of focal coronary atherosclerosis. In multiple regression analysis including HR variability, minimum HR, demographic and clinical variables, smoking, blood pressure, glucose, lipid measurements and lipid-modifying therapy, progression of focal coronary atherosclerosis was independently predicted by the SDNN (beta=0.24; P=0.0001). Low HR variability analyzed from ambulatory ECG predicts rapid progression of coronary artery disease. HR variability provided information on progression of focal coronary atherosclerosis beyond that obtained by traditional risk markers of atherosclerosis.},

abstract = {Identifying emotions in people with severe and profound intellectual disabilities is a difficult challenge. Since self-reports are not available, behaviour is the most used source of information. Given the limitations and caveats associated with using behaviour as the sole source of information about their emotions, it is important to supplement behavioural information with information from another source. As it is accepted that emotions consist of language, behaviour and physiology, in this article we investigated if physiology could give information about the emotions of people with severe and profound intellectual disabilities. To this aim we tested hypotheses derived from the motivational model of . Bradley, Codispoti, Cuthbert, and Lang (2001) about the relation between heart rate and the valence of emotions and between heart rate, skin conductance and skin temperature and behavioural expressions of emotions of people with severe and profound intellectual disability. We presented 27 participants with 4 staff-selected negative and 4 staff-selected positive stimuli. The situations were videotaped and their heart rate, skin conductance and skin temperature was measured. Each behaviour of the participant was coded using the observational method developed by . Petry and Maes (2006). As hypothesized, we found a lower heart rate when participants were presented with negative stimuli than when they were presented with positive stimuli in the first 6. s of stimuli presentation. Their skin temperature was higher for the expression of low intensity negative emotions compared to the expression of low intensity positive emotions. The results suggest that, as with people without disability, heart rate and skin temperature can give information about the emotions of persons with severe and profound ID. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Previous cross-sectional studies have shown that heart rate (HR) and HR variability (HRV) are influenced by several behavioral, biologic, and psychosocial factors. There are very few longitudinal studies that enable analyses of changes in HRV over time at an individual level. This study aimed to describe changes in HR and HRV in a general population setting and to determine predictors of HR and HRV at follow-up. From 1997 to 2004, 1,999 participants (29{\%} women) in the United Kingdom Whitehall II Cohort Study had 2 measurements of cardiac autonomic function (mean time between measurements 5.47 years, range 4.07 to 6.93). The mean ± SD age at the first measurement was 55.6 ± 6.0 years. At baseline, men showed higher low-frequency power than women, suggesting that they may have higher sympathetic activity. Conversely, women had higher high-frequency power, indicating higher parasympathetic tone. Over the 5-year follow-up period, men and women had decreases in HR. Men had reductions in HRV in time and frequency dimensions, whereas women showed increases in HRV. In conclusion, the probability of being in the adverse quartile of HRV function and HR at follow-up was related to baseline exercise, body mass index, cholesterol, and blood pressure. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The study was designed to assess the power of several HRV measures to predict mortality. Dyx was tested in a subset of 206 consecutive Danish patients with analysable Holter recordings. After a median follow-up of 8.5 years 70 patients had died.

abstract = {The amount of time between heartbeats is controlled by the rate of depolarization of the sinoatrial node. This rate is controlled by a combination of sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs. For this reason, analysis of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) derived from intervals between normal heart beats provides insights into changing cardiac autonomic function. Increased sympathetic control of the heart from one time point to the next tends to increase HRs, decrease the amount of vagally modulated sinus arrhythmia measured as high-frequency (HF) spectral power, and increase the ratio between low-frequency (LF) spectral power and HF (the LF/HF ratio). Conversely, a shift toward greater vagal control of the heart tends to produce decreased HRs, increases in HF power, and decreases the LF/HF ratio. Clear circadian cycles of HR and HRV are seen in most subjects and correspond to periods of sleep and activity. The magnitude of these cycles is well captured by traditional HRV indices such as deviation of all normal-to-normal (NN) intervals. Cosinor analysis also provides a rough estimate of the magnitude of circadian rhythms. We have observed that HR and HRV fluctuate over time in a cyclic manner in most subjects. Although these cycles are especially prominent during the nighttime, they are seen in the daytime as well. We have developed a number of measures that quantify ultradian properties of HR/HRV cycles and would permit comparisons between subjects. We applied these measures during overnight polysomnography and have shown that ultradian rhythms of cardiac autonomic modulation have a variable and often weak correspondence with traditional sleep stages . In the current study, we applied the methodology developed for the nighttime recordings to 24-h recordings in young healthy subjects and compared these results to those obtained during the nighttime only in the same subjects and in an older group of cardiac patients. Our purpose was to explore the presenc- e and magnitude of ultradian cycles of HRV during the entire 24-h period and during sleep.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dynamic analysis techniques may quantify abnormalities in heart rate variability (HRV) based on nonlinear and fractal analysis (chaos theory). The article emphasizes clinical and prognostic significance of dynamic changes in short-time series applied on patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) during the exercise electrocardiograph (ECG) test. METHODS: The subjects were included in the series after complete cardiovascular diagnostic data. Series of R-R and ST-T intervals were obtained from exercise ECG data after sampling digitally. The range rescaled analysis method determined the fractal dimension of the intervals. To quantify fractal long-range correlation's properties of heart rate variability, the detrended fluctuation analysis technique was used. Approximate entropy (ApEn) was applied to quantify the regularity and complexity of time series, as well as unpredictability of fluctuations in time series. RESULTS: It was found that the short-term fractal scaling exponent (alpha(1)) is significantly lower in patients with CHD (0.93 +/- 0.07 vs 1.09 +/- 0.04; P {\textless} 0.001). The patients with CHD had higher fractal dimension in each exercise test program separately, as well as in exercise program at all. ApEn was significant lower in CHD group in both RR and ST-T ECG intervals (P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The nonlinear dynamic methods could have clinical and prognostic applicability also in short-time ECG series. Dynamic analysis based on chaos theory during the exercise ECG test point out the multifractal time series in CHD patients who loss normal fractal characteristics and regularity in HRV. Nonlinear analysis technique may complement traditional ECG analysis.},

Each of these measures is a strong predictor of cardiovascular risk and all-cause mortality in primary and secondary prevention settings. These measures have been used to identify correlates of autonomic nervous system dysfunction at both the patient level (eg, obesity, diabetes, heart failure) and the environmental level (eg, smoking, social stress, air pollution). Future research must determine how to exploit the associations between autonomic system dysfunction and poor prognosis to improve patient outcomes.},

Genotypes were divided into 2 groups in accord with prior research. Findings were partially supportive of the hypothesized risk model. These indicated that the Group L genotype (homozygous for the 1 allele), compared with the Group S genotype (homozygous for the s allele plus heterozygous individuals), predicted greater fearful response to the biological challenge.

abstract = {This study evaluated the effects of propranolol on recovery of heart rate variability (HRV) after acute myocardial infarction and its relation to outcome in the Beta-blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT). Beta blockers improve mortality after acute myocardial infarction, but through an unknown mechanism. Depressed HRV, a measure of autonomic tone, predicts mortality after acute myocardial infarction. Whether $\beta$ blockers influence recovery of HRV after acute myocardial infarction, and thereby improve outcome, is unknown. We compared 24-hour HRV parameters at 1 week after acute myocardial infarction and after 6 weeks of treatment with propanolol (n = 88) or placebo (n = 96). The relation between 25-month outcome (death/acute myocardial infarction/congestive heart failure), propranolol treatment, and HRV was further analyzed. After 6 weeks, high-frequency (HF) power (log-normalized), an index of vagal tone, increased more in propranolol-treated patients (4.28 ± 0.1 to 5.17 ± 0.09 ms2) than in placebo-treated patients (4.26 ± 0.09 to 4.77 ± 0.1 ms2, p {\textless}0.05). Sympathovagal balance measured by the low-frequency (LF) to HF ratio increased in placebo-treated patients (3.55 ± 0.24 to 3.86 ± 0.24) but decreased in those treated with propranolol (3.76 ± 0.29 to 3.17 ± 0.23, p {\textless}0.01). Other frequency-domain parameters increased over time but were not affected by propranolol. Propranolol blunted the morning increase in the LF/HF ratio. Recovery of HF, the strongest HRV predictor of outcome, and propranolol therapy independently predicted outcome. In summary, after acute myocardial infarction, propranolol therapy improves recovery of parasympathetic tone, which correlates with improved outcome, and decreases morning sympathetic predominance. These findings may elucidate the mechanisms by which $\beta$ blockers decrease mortality and reduce the early morning risk of sudden death after acute myocardial infarction. {\textcopyright} 2003 by Excerpta Medica, Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction has been correlated with fasting insulin and glucose, independent of clinically diagnosed diabetes. We tested whether men and women (aged 45 to 64 years) from the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities study (n=8185) with ANS dysfunction, estimated by high heart rate (HR) and low HR variability (HRV), were at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Supine HR and HRV indices were measured for 2 minutes at baseline; indices were divided into quartiles for analyses. From 1987 to 1998 (mean follow-up 8.3 years), there were 1063 cases of incident diabetes. The relative risk (RR) of developing diabetes for participants with low-frequency (LF) power (0.04 to 0.15 Hz) HRV in the lowest quartile ({\textless}7.7 ms2) compared with the highest quartile ({\textgreater} or =38.9 ms2) was 1.2 (95{\%} CI 1.0-1.4) after adjustment for age, race, sex, study center, education, alcohol drinking, current smoking, prevalent coronary heart disease, physical activity, and body mass index. Participants in the uppermost ({\textgreater}72.7 bpm) versus the lowest ({\textless} or =60.1 bpm) quartile of HR had a 60{\%} increased risk (95{\%} CI 33{\%}-92{\%}) of developing diabetes. Results were similar when the sample was restricted to participants with normal fasting glucose (glucose {\textless}6.1 mmol/L) at baseline (n=7192) or when adjusted for baseline glucose (HR quartile 4 versus quartile 1, RR=1.4, 95{\%} CI 1.2-1.7). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that ANS dysfunction may be associated with the development of diabetes in healthy adults.},

abstract = {Assessment in clinical psychology typically relies on global retrospective self-reports collected at research or clinic visits, which are limited by recall bias and are not well suited to address how behavior changes over time and across contexts. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) involves repeated sampling of subjects' current behaviors and experiences in real time, in subjects' natural environments. EMA aims to minimize recall bias, maximize ecological validity, and allow study of microprocesses that influence behavior in real-world contexts. EMA studies assess particular events in subjects' lives or assess subjects at periodic intervals, often by random time sampling, using technologies ranging from written diaries and telephones to electronic diaries and physiological sensors. We discuss the rationale for EMA, EMA designs, methodological and practical issues, and comparisons of EMA and recall data. EMA holds unique promise to advance the science and practice of clinical psychology by shedding light on the dynamics of behavior in real-world settings.},

abstract = {Background: Heart rate variability (HRV) measures homeostatic regulation of the autonomic nervous system in response to perturbation and has been previously shown to quantify risk for cardiac events. Despite known interactions among stress vulnerability, psychiatric illness, and cardiac health, however, this is the first study to our knowledge to compare directly the value of laboratory HRV in predicting autonomic modulation of real-world emotional stress. Methods: We recorded electrocardiograms (ECG) on 56 subjects: first, within the laboratory and then during an acute emotional stressor: a first-time skydive. Laboratory sessions included two 5-min ECG recordings separated by one ambulatory 24-hour recording. To test the efficacy of introducing a mild emotional challenge, during each of the 5-min laboratory recordings, subjects viewed either aversive or benign images. Following the laboratory session, subjects participated in the acute stressor wearing a Holter ECG. Artifact-free ECGs (n = 33) were analyzed for HRV then statistically compared across laboratory and acute stress sessions. Results: There were robust correlations (r = .7-.8) between the laboratory and acute stress HRV, indicating that the two most useful paradigms (long-term wake, followed by short-term challenge) were also most sensitive to distinct components of the acute stressor: the former correlated with the fine-tuned regulatory modulation occurring immediately prior and following the acute stressor, whereas the latter correlated with gross amplitude and recovery. Conclusions: Our results confirmed the efficacy of laboratory-acquired HRV in predicting autonomic response to acute emotional stress and suggest that ambulatory and challenge protocols enhance predictive value. {\textcopyright} 2010 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

Twenty-one women with current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 23 with lifetime but not current PTSD, and 13 women who never had PTSD listened to 15 95-dB, 500-ms, 1000-Hz tones with a 0-ms rise time while heart rate (HR), skin conductance (SC), and orbicularis oculi electromyogram (EMG) responses were measured. Participants in the current and lifetime PTSD groups produced larger HR responses across tones and showed slower absolute habituation of SC response magnitude compared with the never PTSD group. EMG response magnitudes did not differ among groups. Women with CSA-related PTSD showed increased autonomic reactivity and slower habituation to high-intensity tones similar to that observed in primarily male, combat PTSD samples. This suggests that heightened autonomic responsivity to startling stimuli in PTSD is not gender or event specific. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Serotonin (5-HT) is crucial to normal reflex vagal modulation of heart rate (HR). Reduced baroreflex sensitivity [spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (sBRS)] and HR variability (HRV) reflect impaired neural, particularly vagal, control of HR and are independently associated with depression. In conscious, telemetered Flinders-Sensitive Line (FSL) rats, a well-validated animal model of depression, we tested the hypothesis that cardiovascular regulatory abnormalities are present and associated with deficient serotonergic control of reflex cardiovagal function. In FSL rats and control Flinders-Resistant (FRL) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat strains, diurnal measurements of HR, arterial pressure (AP), activity, sBRS, and HRV were made. All strains had normal and similar diurnal variations in HR, AP, and activity. In FRL rats, HR was elevated, contributing to the reduced HRV and sBRS in this strain. In FSL rats, sBRS and high-frequency power HRV were reduced during the night, indicating reduced reflex cardiovagal activity. The ratio of low- to high-frequency bands of HRV was increased in FSL rats, suggesting a relative predominance of cardiac sympathetic and/or reflex activity compared with FRL and SD rats. These data show that conscious FSL rats have cardiovascular regulatory abnormalities similar to depressed humans. Acute changes in HR, AP, temperature, and sBRS in response to 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, a 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1B), and 5-HT(7) receptor agonist, were also determined. In FSL rats, despite inducing an exaggerated hypothermic effect, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin did not decrease HR and AP or improve sBRS, suggesting impaired serotonergic neural control of cardiovagal activity. These data suggest that impaired serotonergic control of cardiac reflex function could be one mechanism linking reduced sBRS to increased cardiac risk in depression.},

@article{Schnall1999,
abstract = {We report a novel approach to the determination of sleep apnea based on measuring the peripheral circulatory responses in a primary condition of disordered breathing. The apparatus is a finger plethysmograph coupled to a constant volume, variable pressure, pneumatic system. The plethysmograph's tip (measurement site) is composed of two parallel opposing longitudinal half thimbles, which is attached to a contiguous annular cuff. Each compartment consists of an internal membrane surrounded by an outer rigid wall. These provide a uniform pressure field and impart a two-point locking action preventing axial and longitudinal motion of the finger. Subdiastolic pressure is applied to prevent venous pooling, engorgement, and stasis, to inhibit retrograde venous shock wave propagation and partially unload arterial wall tension. The annular cuff extends the effective boundary of the pressure field beyond the measuring site. In 42 patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) profound, transient vasoconstriction and tachycardia usually of a periodic nature, were clearly seen with each apneic event, possibly related to transient arousal. Good agreement was found between standard total apnea-hypopnea scoring, 129.5+/-22.4 (Mean +/- SEM), and transient vasoconstriction and tachycardia events, 121.2+/-19.4 (R = .92, p{\textless}.0001). We conclude that the finger tip exemplifies the scope of peripheral vascular responsiveness due to its high density of alpha sympathetic innervation, and its high degree of blood flow rate lability. Given that elevated peripheral resistance and tightly linked transient heart rate elevation is a consistent part of the hemodynamic response to arousal and OSAS, we believe that pulsatile finger blood flow patterns can be clearly diagnostic of OSAS and other sleep-disordered breathing conditions.},

This review considers the evidence for several behavioral and physiological mechanisms that might explain how depression increases the risk for incident coronary disease and for subsequent cardiac morbidity and mortality. The candidate mechanisms include: (1) antidepressant cardiotoxicity; (2) association of depression with cardiac risk factor such as cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and reduced functional capacity; (3) association of depression with greater coronary disease severity; (4) nonadherence to cardiac prevention and treatment regimens; (5) lower heart rate variability (HRV) reflecting altered cardiac autonomic tone; (6) increased platelet aggregation; and (7) inflammatory processes. Despite recent advances in our understanding of these potential mechanisms, further research is needed to determine how depression increases risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that indexes describing heart rate (HR) dynamics may predict subsequent deaths of patients after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Because $\beta$-blocking (BB) drugs affect both mortality and HR dynamics, the prognostic power of measurements of HR dynamics may have changed in the current era of BB therapy. This study assessed the temporal changes and prognostic significance of time-domain, spectral, and fractal indexes of HR variability along with HR turbulence after an AMI among patients with optimized BB medication. SD of NN intervals, spectral indexes, the short-term fractal scaling exponent ($\alpha$1), power-law slope ($\beta$), and turbulence onset and slope were measured in 600 patients at 5 to 7 days after AMI and in 416 patients at 12 months after AMI. In the multivariate analysis, after adjusting for clinical variables, only reduced fractal HR indexes, $\alpha$1and $\beta$ (p {\textless}0.01 for both), turbulence onset, and slope (p {\textless}0.05 for both), measured at the convalescent phase after AMI, predicted subsequent cardiac death. All time-domain and spectral HR variability indexes and turbulence onset increased significantly during the 12-month period after AMI (p {\textless}0.001 for all), whereas the fractal indexes and turbulence slope remained unchanged. Late after AMI, reduced $\beta$ (p {\textless}0.05) and turbulence slope (p {\textless}0.01) were the only independent predictors of cardiac mortality. Traditional time-domain and spectral measurements of HR variability and turbulence onset improved significantly after AMI, whereas the fractal HR dynamics and turbulence slope remained stable. Fractal HR variability and HR turbulence retain their prognostic power in the BB era, when measured either at the convalescent or late phase after AMI. {\textcopyright} 2003 by Excerpta Medica, Inc.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine if there is dysregulated autonomic nervous system activity as manifested by depressed heart rate variability (HRV) among veterans of Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF). PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The study used a convenience sample of OEF/OIF veterans (n = 28) seen at a Level II Polytrauma Network Site at the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center. Participants were similar to other OEF/OIF veterans who received care at this site. DESIGN: Cross sectional study. MEASURES: Time domain analysis (standard deviation of beat-to-beat intervals [SDNN]) of HRV, diagnoses of mild traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and pain ratings from medical records. RESULTS: As a group, the sample evidenced markedly depressed HRV (as reflected by SDNN) as compared with available age and gender corrected normative data. Pain (71{\%}), PTSD (57{\%}), and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) (64{\%}) were prevalent. Thirty-six percent had all three measures (P3). Pain and P3 were significantly and negatively associated with SDNN (r = -0.460, P = 0.014; r = -0.373, P = 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings support the high prevalence of depressed HRV and P3 among veterans seen in a level II Polytrauma Center. The findings also suggest a possible synergistic effect of pain, PTSD, and mTBI on depressed HRV. The nature and implications of these relationships require additional research to elucidate.},

abstract = {Background: Depression is associated with an increased risk for mortality after acute myocardial infarction (MI). The purpose of this study was to determine whether low heart rate variability (HRV) mediates the effect of depression on mortality. Methods: Twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were obtained from 311 depressed patients with a recent acute MI who were enrolled in the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease (ENRICHD) clinical trial and from 367 nondepressed patients who met the ENRICHD medical inclusion criteria. Standard HRV indexes were extracted from the recordings. Results: The log of very low-frequency (LnVLF) power, an index of HRV derived from power spectral analysis of the electrocardiogram signal (0.0033-0.04 Hz [in milliseconds squared]), was lower in the depressed than in the nondepressed patients (P{\textless}.001). There were 47 deaths (6.1{\%}) during a 30-month follow-up. After adjusting for potential confounders, the depressed patients remained at higher risk for all-cause mortality compared with the nondepressed patients (hazard ratio, 2.8; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.4-5.4; P{\textless}.003). When LnVLF power was entered into the model, the hazard ratio for depression dropped to 2.1 (95{\%} CI, 1.1-4.2; P=.03). The proportion of the risk for depression attributable to LnVLF power was 0.27 (95{\%} CI, 0.23-0.31; P{\textless}.001). Conclusions: Low HRV partially mediates the effect of depression on survival after acute MI. This finding helps to clarify the physiological mechanisms underlying depression's role as a risk factor for mortality in patients with coronary heart disease. It also raises the possibility that treatments that improve both depression and HRV might also improve survival in these patients. {\textcopyright}2005 American Medical Association.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Information is limited about ECG predictors of the risk of incident congestive heart failure (CHF), particularly in women without overt manifestations of cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated hazard ratios for incident CHF and all-cause mortality using Cox regression in 38,283 participants of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) during a 9-year follow-up. All risk models were adjusted for demographic and available clinical and therapeutic variables (multivariable-adjusted models). A backward selection procedure was used to identify dominant predictors among those that were significant as individual ECG predictors. Eleven ECG variables were significant predictors of incident CHF, with none of them having a significant interaction with baseline CVD status. From 6 dominant ECG predictors, wide QRS/T angle had a nearly 3-fold increased risk in multivariable-adjusted single ECG variable models. Two other repolarization variables, STV5 depression and high TV1 amplitude, and 2 QRS-related variables, QRS non-dipolar voltage and myocardial infarction (MI) by ECG, were all associated with {\&}2-fold increase of incident CHF risk. Overall, 11 of the 12 ECG variables were significant predictors of all-cause mortality. Four variables had a significant interaction with CVD status requiring stratification. Three among these 4 were strong, dominant predictors in the CVD group: ECG MI, wide QRS/T angle, and low TV5 amplitude had risk increase from {\textgreater}2-fold to 3-fold, with considerably lower risks in the CVD-free group. CONCLUSIONS: Several repolarization variables in postmenopausal women are predictors of the risk of incident CHF and all-cause mortality as important as old ECG MI.},

abstract = {In the present paper we present the outlines of a model that integrates autonomic, attentional, and affective systems into a functional and structural network that may help to guide us in our understanding of emotion regulation and dysregulation. We will emphasize the relationship between attentional regulation and affective processes and propose a group of underlying physiological systems that serve to integrate these functions in the service of self-regulation and adaptability of the organism. We will attempt to place this network in the context of dynamical systems models which involve feedback and feedforward circuits with special attention to negative feedback mechanisms, inhibitory processes, and their role in response selection. From a systems perspective, inhibitory processes can be viewed as negative feedback circuits that allow for the interruption of ongoing behavior and the re-deployment of resources to other tasks. When these negative feedback mechanisms are compromised, positive feedback loops may develop as a result (of dis-inhibition). From this perspective, the relative sympathetic activation seen in anxiety disorders may represent dis-inhibition due to faulty inhibitory mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Mental stress provokes myocardial ischemia in many patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) portends a worse prognosis, independent of standard cardiac risk factors or outcome of traditional physical stress testing. Angiotensin II plays a significant role in the physiological response to stress, but its role in MSIMI remains unknown. Our aim was to evaluate whether the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) is associated with a differential effect on the incidence of MSIMI compared with ischemia during physical stress.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Retrospective analysis of 218 patients with stable CAD, including 110 on ACEI, was performed. 99m-Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging was used to define ischemia during mental stress, induced by a standardized public speaking task, and during physical stress, induced by either exercise or adenosine.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Overall, 40 patients (18{\%}) developed MSIMI and 80 patients (37{\%}) developed ischemia during physical stress. MSIMI occurred less frequently in patients receiving ACEIs (13{\%}) compared with those not on ACEIs (24{\%}; p = .030, adjusted odds ratio = 0.42, 95{\%} confidence interval = 0.19-0.91). In contrast, the frequency of myocardial ischemia during physical stress testing was similar in both groups (39{\%} versus 35{\%} in those on and not on ACEIs, respectively); adjusted odds ratio = 0.91, 95{\%} confidence interval = 0.48-1.73).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: In this retrospective study, patients using ACEI therapy displayed less than half the risk of developing ischemia during mental stress but not physical stress. This possible beneficial effect of ACEIs on MSIMI may be contributing to their salutary effects in CAD.},

abstract = {Power spectrum analysis of cardiovascular signal variability, and in particular of the RR period (heart rate variability, HRV), is a widely used methodology for investigating autonomic neural regulation in health and disease that can quantify the sympathovagal balance modulating the sinus node pacemaker. In some cases, it can also quantify the neural regulation of other organs or apparatuses. However, use of the correct methodology is crucial to extract the information embedded in the frequency domain. In numerous abnormal conditions, such as essential arterial hypertension, acute myocardial infarction and heart failure, the sympathovagal balance may be altered in basal conditions. However, a reduced responsiveness to an excitatory stimulus is the most common feature that characterizes numerous pathophysiological states. The attenuation of an oscillatory pattern can also reflect an altered target function, thus providing important prognostic markers. The general features of this approach correspond well to the needs of an internist attempting to envisage the involvement of the whole organism in a disease process. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Background: There is extensive evidence that the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system can modulate psychophysiological arousal. To date, no studies have investigated associations between cardiac vagal tone and the time course of arousal during exposure to trauma-related stimuli in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods: Thirty-one subjects, 29 with PTSD and 2 with partial PTSD, had electrocardiograms recorded during baseline and 2-minute traumatic and neutral script-driven imagery periods. Heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and heart rate half-recovery to the trauma script were quantified, and subjects were divided into low and high baseline RSA groups. Results: Across all participants, heart rate significantly increased from the neutral to the trauma script and RSA significantly decreased from baseline to trauma script (p {\textless} .05). As predicted, low RSA subjects had more prolonged heart rate increases to the trauma script than high RSA subjects (p {\textless} .001), and heart rate half-recovery was negatively correlated to baseline RSA (r = -.50, p = .005). Conclusions: This study is the first to find decreased RSA in response to a traumatic reminder and an association between low baseline RSA and sustained conditioned arousal in PTSD. Low vagal tone may account for deficient arousal and emotion regulation capacities often observed in PTSD.},

abstract = {Objective: Evidence of elevated basal heart rate (HR) in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been interpreted in terms of elevated sympathetic cardiac activity, as have possible increased cardiovascular disease risks and outcomes associated with elevated HR. Yet it is well-established that the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system not only influences HR independently of the sympathetic branch, but makes a greater contribution to HR, including resting HR. Additionally, abnormally low tonic parasympathetic activity on the heart has been implicated in cardiovascular disease and hypertension. This study addressed a potential parasympathetic contribution to elevated basal HR in PTSD. Methods: We used a descriptive and subgroup differences approach to investigate relationships between parasympathetic activity and basal HR in 59 adults (50 females) with PTSD, all of whom were participants in a treatment outcome study and assessed prior to exposure to trauma-related script-driven imagery. Consistent with the well-known relationship between parasympathetic activity and HR, we hypothesized that basal respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a measure of parasympathetic cardiac activity, would be negatively correlated with basal HR. More important, we predicted that pathologically elevated HRs previously associated with PTSD would only characterize a low-RSA subgroup. Potential confounds of age, respiration rate, and aerobic fitness were addressed. Results: As predicted, mean HR was 80.5 bpm in the low-RSA tercile group, similar to mean HRs of PTSD groups in prior research and significantly higher than 69 and 65 bpm in the middle- and high-RSA groups, respectively, which are typical of non-PTSD controls. Conclusion: These findings suggest that a substantial proportion of those with PTSD may not have elevated basal HRs. Furthermore, among those who do exhibit elevated HR, there may be a parasympathetic contribution that is independent of any sympathetic one. Only measuring both branches at once, ideally with autonomic blockades, can definitively address these issues. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the present paper, we describe a model of neurovisceral integration in which a set of neural structures involved in cognitive, affective, and autonomic regulation are related to heart rate variability (HRV) and cognitive performance. METHODS: We detail the pathways involved in the neural regulation of the cardiovascular system and provide pharmacological and neuroimaging data in support of the neural structures linking the central nervous system to HRV in humans. We review a number of studies from our group showing that individual differences in HRV are related to performance on tasks associated with executive function and prefrontal cortical activity. These studies include comparisons of executive- and nonexecutive-function tasks in healthy participants, in both threatening and nonthreatening conditions. In addition, we show that manipulating resting HRV levels is associated with changes in performance on executive-function tasks. We also examine the relationship between HRV and cognitive performance in ecologically valid situations using a police shooting simulation and a naval navigation simulation. Finally, we review our studies in anxiety patients, as well as studies examining psychopathy. CONCLUSION: These findings in total suggest an important relationship among cognitive performance, HRV, and prefrontal neural function that has important implications for both physical and mental health. Future studies are needed to determine exactly which executive functions are associated with individual differences in HRV in a wider range of situations and populations.},

We tested the hypothesis that postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy was associated with more favorable heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) in a population sample of women (n = 2,621). Hormone therapy use was measured at four examinations beginning in 1987. Supine HR and HRV indices were measured for 6 minutes at the final examination (1996-1998). In unadjusted linear regression models, hormone therapy was associated with lower HR (hormone use = 64.7 vs. never = 65.7 beats/min, P = .01) and higher HRV. However, following adjustment for age and CHD risk factors, both associations were eliminated. Results from this observational study suggest that hormone therapy is not associated with HR or HRV. These analyses should be replicated in a randomized trial. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) has been shown to be attenuated in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and may, therefore, be possibly used for the early detection of myocardial ischemia. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic yield of a novel short-term HRV algorithm for the detection of myocardial ischemia in subjects without known CAD. We prospectively enrolled 450 subjects without known CAD who were referred to tertiary medical centers for exercise stress testing (EST) with single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). All subjects underwent 1-hour Holter testing with subsequent HRV analysis before EST with MPI. The diagnostic yield of HRV analysis was compared with EST, using MPI as the gold standard for the noninvasive detection of myocardial ischemia. All subjects had intermediate pretest probability for CAD. Mean age was 62 years, 38{\%} were women, 51{\%} had hypertension, and 25{\%} diabetes mellitus. HRV analysis showed superior sensitivity (77{\%}) compared with standard EST (27{\%}). After multivariate adjustment, HRV was independently associated with an 8.4-fold (p {\textless}0.001) increased likelihood for the detection of myocardial ischemia by MPI, whereas EST did not show a statistically significant association with a positive MPI (odds ratio 2.1; p = 0.12). Of subjects who were referred for subsequent coronary angiography, the respective sensitivities of HRV and EST for the detection of significant CAD were 73{\%} versus 26{\%}. Our data suggest that HRV can be used as an important noninvasive technique for the detection of myocardial ischemia in subjects without known CAD, providing superior sensitivity to conventional EST in this population.},

abstract = {Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) develops following exposure to atraumatic event and is characterized by persistent intense reactivity to trauma related cues. Equally important, but less studied, is the failure to restore physiological homeostasis after these excessive reactions. This study investigates psychophysiological markers of sustained cardiac activity after exposure to reminders of traumatic event in PTSD patients. Methods: Participants passively listened to neutral and personal traumatic event while electrocardiogram was continuously recorded. Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) were analyzed in 19 PTSD patients and 16 trauma-exposed controls. Results: Both PTSD patients and trauma exposed controls exhibited a significant increase in HR to the exposure of their personal trauma. PTSD patients sustained the increase of HR while controls recovered to basal levels. In PTSD patients, sustained HR was positively associated with re-experiencing symptoms. The PTSD group also showed a reduced HRV (a measure of parasympathetic influence on the heart) during personal trauma exposure and lack of recovery. Limitations: The sample size was small and PTSD patients were under medication. Conclusions: Our findings provide an experimental account of the failure of PTSD patients to exhibit physiological recovery after exposure to trauma-related stimuli. PTSD patients exhibited a sustained tachycardia with attenuation of HRV that persisted even after cessation of the stressor. Re-experiencing symptoms facilitated engagement in the trauma cues, suggesting that, in their daily-life, patients most likely present repeated episodes of sustained over-reactivity, which may underpin the emotional dysregulation characteristic of PTSD. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Accurate measurements of autonomic nerve regulation in heart failure (HF) were unresolved. The discriminating performance of deceleration and acceleration capacities of heart rate in HF was evaluated in 130 HF patients and 212 controls. Acceleration capacity and deceleration capacity were independent risk factors for HF in males, evaluated by multiple logistic regression analysis, with odds ratios (ORs) of 5.94 and 0.13, respectively. Acceleration capacity was also an independent risk factor for HF in females, with an OR of 8.58. Deceleration capacity was the best cardiac electrophysiological index to classify HF in males, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.88. Deceleration capacity was the best classification factor of HF in females with an AUC of 0.97, significantly higher than even left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Acceleration capacity also showed high performance in classifying HF in males (0.84) and females (0.92). The cut-off values of deceleration capacity for HF classification in males and females were 4.55 ms and 4.85 ms, respectively. The cut-off values of acceleration capacity for HF classification in males and females were −6.15 ms and −5.75 ms, respectively. Our study illustrates the role of acceleration and deceleration capacity measurements in the neuro-pathophysiology of HF. Heart failure (HF) refers to structural or functional impairment in the ventricular filling or ejection of blood, which may lead to fluid retention, pulmonary congestion, peripheral edema, and a complex clinical syndrome 1 . HF may be caused by disorders of the myocardium, heart valves, pericardium, and endocardium 2 . Hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and certain metabolic abnormalities are also common etiological factors of HF 3 . HF is a major challenge to public health; in the United States, there are as many as 650,000 new cases diagnosed annually, and this rate has remained stable over the past several decades 4 . The absolute mortality rate for HF is estimated to be {\~{}}50{\%} within 5 years of diagnosis 1,5 . The physiological activity of the heart is controlled and modulated by the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems 6,7 . The sympathetic nervous system has a wide variety of cardiovascular actions, including heart rate acceleration, increased cardiac contractility, reduction of venous capacitance, and constriction of resistance vessels 7,8 . The cardiovascular effects of the parasympathetic nervous system (vagus nerve) include heart rate reduction by inhibiting the sympathetic nervous system and by direct hyperpolarization of sinus nodal cells 6,9 . Disorders in parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems of the heart may coexist with serious heart conse-quences, including HF 6,9 . Dysregulation of cardiac adrenergic receptor signaling and transduction will influence cardiac inotropy and is a key feature in HF progression 7,10 . In contrast, the pathophysiological roles of normal and disordered parasympathetic innervation in heart are not as well understood 6–11 . The real-time roles of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems on the heart are difficult to monitor. However, increasing numbers of studies have shown that these roles are reflected in cardiac electro-physiology 6–11 . Heart rate variability (HRV) is the physiological phenomenon of variation in the interval between heart beats, which can be measured and calculated from a continuous electrocardiograph record 12 . In recent decades, time and frequency domain measures of HRV have been considered to represent promising markers of a significant relationship among autonomic nervous system activity, HF, and cardiovascular mortality 12,13 . Although evidence for an association between a propensity for lethal arrhythmias and signs of increased sym-pathetic or reduced vagal activity is abundant, the significance of the many different HRV indexes is more com-plex than generally appreciated, and there is potential for incorrect conclusions and for excessive or unfounded extrapolations 12 . In 2006, Baver et al. established an approach to distinguish between vagal and sympathetic nervous system roles that affect cardiac electrophysiology using a signal processing algorithm to separately characterize the decel-eration and acceleration capacities of the heart rate 14 . The deceleration and acceleration capacities of heart rate were quantified by assessing 24-h ambulatory electrocardiogram recordings 14,15 . The authors found that decreased heart rate deceleration capacity was a powerful predictor of mortality after myocardial infarction, better than left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), conventional measures of HRV, and the combination of the two 14 . Their report advanced cardiac electrophysiological analysis and provided a new approach to quantify the effects of the vagal and sympathetic nervous systems on heart physiology. Although elevated sympathetic activity is associated with an adverse prognosis, and a high level of parasym-pathetic activation confers cardioprotection 6 , a multitude of unknown questions still need to be answered. The parasympathetic actions on the heart are mediated not only by cardiac muscarinic receptor stimulation but also by many known and unknown mechanisms 6 . The role of the vagal nerve in heart biological activity has only recently been investigated in human subjects with HF. Thus, we should consider that any novel approach might advance our knowledge of cardiac nerve electrophysiology. In this report, the significance of acceleration capacity and deceleration in HF was evaluated comprehensively by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and multiple logistic regression analysis together with echocardiographic and HRV indexes under strict statistical quality con-trol. Our data provide new insights into how parasympathetic and sympathetic activation affects HF.},

METHODS:Orthogonal ECGs were recorded at rest for 10 minutes in 160 healthy men and women (mean age 39.6±14.6, 80 men). Mean spatial TT' angle, and normalized variances of T loop area, of spatial T vector amplitude, of QT interval and Tpeak-Tend area were measured for assessment of repolarization lability. Normalized variances of spatial QRS vector and QRS loop area characterized variability of depolarization. In addition, variability indices (VI) were calculated to adjust for normalized heart rate variance. SAI QRST was measured as the averaged arithmetic sum of areas under the QRST curve.

RESULTS:Men were characterized by shorter QTc (430.3±21.7 vs. 444.7±22.2 ms; P{\textless}0.0001) and larger SAI QRST (282.1±66.7 vs. 204.9±58.5 mV*ms; P{\textless}0.0001). Repolarization lability negatively correlated with spatial T vector amplitude. Adjusted by normalized heart rate variance, QT variability index was significantly higher in women than in men (-1.54±0.38 vs. -1.70±0.33; P = 0.017). However, in multivariate logistic regression after adjustment for body surface area, QTc, and spatial T vector amplitude, healthy men had 1.5-3 fold higher probability of having larger repolarization lability, as compared to healthy women (T vector amplitude variability index odds ratio 3.88 (95{\%}CI 1.4-11.1; P = 0.012).

CONCLUSIONS:Healthy men more likely than women have larger repolarization lability.},

abstract = {A beat-to-beat model of the cardiovascular system is developed to study the spontaneous short-term variability in arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) data from humans at rest. The model consists of a set of difference equations representing the following mechanisms: 1) control of HR and peripheral resistance by the baroreflex, 2) Windkessel properties of the systemic arterial tree, 3) contractile properties of the myocardium (Starling's law and restitution), and 4) mechanical effects of respiration on BP. The model is tested by comparing power spectra and cross spectra of simulated data from the model with spectra of actual data from resting subjects. To make spectra from simulated data and from actual data tally, it must be assumed that respiratory sinus arrhythmia at rest is caused by the conversion of respiratory BP variability into HR variability by the fast, vagally mediated baroreflex. The so-called 10-s rhythm in HR and BP appears as a resonance phenomenon due to the delay in the sympathetic control loop of the baroreflex. The simulated response of the model to an imposed increase of BP is shown to correspond with the BP and HR response in patients after administration of a BP-increasing drug, such as phenylephrine. It is concluded that the model correctly describes a number of important features of the cardiovascular system. Mathematical properties of the difference-equation model are discussed.},

abstract = {There are complex interactions between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system inputs to the sinus node. The concept of "sympathovagal balance" reflects the autonomic state resulting from the sympathetic and parasympathetic influences. Despite widespread usage of a variety of heart rate (HR) variability parameters as indexes of sympathovagal balance, no index has been validated as a measure of sympathovagal balance. This study evaluated the utility of HR, HR variability, and a new parameter termed the vagal-sympathetic effect (VSE) as indexes of sympathovagal balance. The ideal parameter had to satisfy the following criteria: 1) the index should vary similarly among subjects in response to different autonomic conditions; 2) the variability in the index among subjects exposed to the same autonomic conditions should be small; and 3) the response of the index to various autonomic conditions should reflect the underlying changes in physiological state and have a meaningful interpretation. Volunteers [8 men, 6 women; mean age 28.5 {\{}+/-{\}} 4.8 (SD) yr] were evaluated for the effects of sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation and blockade on HR and HR variability. VSE was defined as the ratio of the R-R interval to the intrinsic R-R interval. VSE and R-R interval consistently changed in the expected directions with parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation and blockade. A general linearized model was used to evaluate the response of each parameter. VSE and R-R interval had r2 values of 0.847 and 0.852, respectively. Natural logarithm of the low-frequency power had an r2 value of 0.781 with lower r2 values for all the other HR variability parameters. The coefficient of variation was also lowest for each condition tested for the VSE and the R-R interval. VSE and R-R interval best satisfy the criteria for the ideal index of sympathovagal balance. Because it is impractical under most conditions to measure the VSE as the index of sympathovagal balance, the most suitable index is the R-R interval.

abstract = {Power spectrum analysis of heart rate variability (PSA of HRV) is a promising method, which can be used as an index of cardiac autonomic balance. PSA of HRV is a noninvasive technique, based on ECG sampling of RR interval variation, thus providing a dynamic assessment of sympathetic and parasympathetic tone, reflecting the interactions between the two. It has been shown to have potential value in various laboratory and clinical conditions. It is influenced by many factors such as age, sex, position, breathing, smoking, hour of the day and medications. Different methods of data processing by various authors have often elicited conflicting results. Standard values are not yet available to be used or compared in different settings. From the interest it has raised, it may be expected that this method will be in widespread use in clinical practice in the future, providing a useful tool, both for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, as well as serving as a further aid towards monitoring therapeutic interventions. This review highlights techniques of dynamic assessment of HRV and studies of its clinical applications in psychiatry in particular. It raises the potentially important prognostic implications of protracted autonomic dysfunction in psychiatric patient populations, especially for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.},

UK-HEART examined the value of heart rate variability (HRV) measures as independent predictors of death in CHF. Methods and Results--In a prospective study powered for mortality, we recruited 433 outpatients 62{\{}+/-{\}}9.6 years old with CHF (NYHA functional class I to III; mean ejection fraction, 0.41{\{}+/-{\}}0.17). Time-domain HRV indices and conventional prognostic indicators were related to death by multivariate analysis. During 482{\{}+/-{\}}161 days of follow-up, cardiothoracic ratio, SDNN, left ventricular end-systolic diameter, and serum sodium were significant predictors of all-cause mortality. The risk ratio for a 41.2-ms decrease in SDNN was 1.62 (95{\%} CI, 1.16 to 2.44). The annual mortality rate for the study population in SDNN subgroups was 5.5{\%} for {\textgreater}100 ms, 12.7{\%} for 50 to 100 ms, and 51.4{\%} for {\textless}50 ms. SDNN, creatinine, and serum sodium were related to progressive heart failure death. Cardiothoracic ratio, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, the presence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and serum potassium were related to sudden cardiac death. A reduction in SDNN was the most powerful predictor of the risk of death due to progressive heart failure. Conclusions--CHF is associated with autonomic dysfunction, which can be quantified by measuring HRV. A reduction in SDNN identifies patients at high risk of death and is a better predictor of death due to progressive heart failure than other conventional clinical measurements. High-risk subgroups identified by this measurement are candidates for additional therapy after prescription of an ACE inhibitor.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between depressed mood and parasympathetic control of the heart in healthy men and women at rest and during two stressors. METHODS: Fifty-three healthy college students completed a laboratory stress protocol that included a baseline resting period, a challenging speech task, and a forehead cold pressor task. Depressed mood was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Parasympathetic cardiac control was measured as the high-frequency (0.12-0.40 Hz) component (HF) of heart rate variability using power spectrum analysis. Blood pressure, respiration rate, and respiration amplitude were measured simultaneously. RESULTS: Participants were categorized as having a high or low depressed mood on the basis of median splits of their BDI scores. Those in the high depressed mood group had significantly greater reductions in HF during the speech task and significantly smaller increases in HF during the forehead cold pressor task than those in the low depressed mood group. Women had significantly greater reductions in HF during the speech task and smaller increases in HF during the forehead cold pressor task than men. However, gender and depressed mood did not interact to predict changes in HF. CONCLUSIONS: Depressed mood is related to the magnitude of decrease in parasympathetic cardiac control during stressors in healthy men and women. These findings extend those of previous studies, in which a similar phenomenon was observed among patients with cardiac disease. Because the participants in this study were healthy, the relationship between depressed mood and parasympathetic cardiac control does not seem to be secondary to cardiovascular disease.{\$}\backslash{\$}n},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although heart rate variability (HRV) at 0.1 Hz has been proposed as a noninvasive clinical measure of cardiac sympathetic nerve firing, this premise has not been sufficiently validated by comparison with techniques such as microneurography and the measurement of norepinephrine spillover from the heart that more directly reflect presynaptic sympathetic activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared the three techniques under conditions of effective cardiac sympathetic denervation, pure autonomic failure (n = 4), dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency (n = 1), and after cardiac transplantation (n = 9) as well as in the context of sympathetic nervous activation in cardiac failure (n = 15) and with aging (n = 10). Age-matched comparisons were made in each case with healthy individuals drawn from a pool of 52 volunteers. In pure autonomic failure and early after transplantation, cardiac norepinephrine spillover was negligible, and HRV was low. Late after transplantation, however, cardiac norepinephrine spillover returned to normal levels, and HRV remained low. In comparison to younger subjects (18 to 35 years old), older individuals (60 to 75 years old) had higher muscle sympathetic nerve activity (young, 22.9 +/- 1.9; old, 31.3 +/- 5.8 bursts per minute; P {\textless} .05) and cardiac norepinephrine spillover (young, 14.3 +/- 2.5; old, 20.1 +/- 3.0 ng/min; P {\textless} .05). In contrast, total HRV was reduced by 89{\%}, and at 0.1 Hz it was reduced by 93{\%} (P {\textless} .05). Cardiac failure was also characterized by elevated cardiac norepinephrine spillover (cardiac failure patients, 59 +/- 4; healthy volunteers, 18 +/- 3 ng/min; P {\textless} .01) but reduced 0.1 Hz HRV (cardiac failure patients, 49 +/- 17; healthy volunteers, 243 +/- 4 ms2; P {\textless} .05). CONCLUSIONS: HRV at 0.1 Hz depends on factors in addition to cardiac sympathetic nerve firing rates, including multiple neural reflexes, cardiac adrenergic receptor sensitivity, postsynaptic signal transduction, and electrochemical coupling, and is not directly related to cardiac norepinephrine spillover, which is a more direct measure of the sympathetic nerve firing rate.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence exists linking major depressive disorder (MDD) with clinical cardiovascular events. The importance of the sympathetic nervous system in the generation of cardiac risk in other contexts is established. OBJECTIVE: To examine the importance of the sympathetic nervous system in the generation of cardiac risk in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS: Studies were performed in 39 patients meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV) criteria for MDD and in 76 healthy subjects. Treatment for patients consisted of selective serotonin reuptake inhibition (SSRI) for 12 weeks. Whole body and cardiac sympathetic activity were examined using noradrenaline isotope dilution methodology and sympathetic nerve recording techniques. Measurement of the extraction of infused tritiated noradrenaline by the heart, and estimation of cardiac dihydroxyphenylglycol production provided direct quantification of neuronal noradrenaline reuptake. RESULTS: Sympathetic activity, particularly in the heart and for the whole body, in patients with MDD followed a bimodal distribution. Elevated values were observed in patients with co-morbid panic disorder (P = 0.006). Consistent with a defect in noradrenaline reuptake, the cardiac extraction of tritiated noradrenaline (0.80 +/- 0.01 versus 0.56 +/- 0.04{\%}, P {\textless} 0.001) and cardiac dihydroxyphenylglycol overflow (109 +/- 8 versus 73 +/- 11, P = 0.01) were reduced in patients with MDD. SSRI therapy abolished the excessive sympathetic activation, with whole body noradrenaline spillover falling from 518 +/- 83 to 290 +/- 41 ng/min (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a subset of patients with MDD in whom sympathetic nervous activity is extraordinarily high, including in the sympathetic outflow to the heart. Treatment with an SSRI may reduce sympathetic activity in a manner likely to reduce cardiac risk.},

Patients awaiting organ transplantation have significant physical disabilities and are at risk for psychological distress. Attenuated heart rate variability (HRV) is a risk factor for a negative long-term outcome in some patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: The study intended to evaluate the clinical utility of laughter yoga in improving psychological and physiological measures in outpatients awaiting organ transplantation. Positive results would indicate promising areas to pursue in a follow-up study.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: Six participants met for 10 sessions over 4 weeks. The research team measured each participant's heart rate, HRV, blood pressure (BP), and immediate mood before and after the laughter and control interventions. The team assessed participants' longer-term mood (anxiety and depression) at the study's initiation, after a no-treatment control week, and at the end of the study.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSETTING: The study occurred at the Department of Surgery and Medicine at the University of Arizona Health Sciences Center, Tucson.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPARTICIPANTS: Participants were patients awaiting transplants (three heart and three lung), two women and four men (ages 51-69 y). Participants had received no major surgery in the 3 months prior to the intervention, did not have a hernia or uncontrolled hypertension, and did not fall into the New York Heart Association function class 4.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERVENTION: The 20-minute laughter intervention involved breathing and stretching exercises, simulated laughter (ie, unconditional laughter that is not contingent on the environment), chanting, clapping, and a meditation. The 20-minute control intervention involved the study's personnel discussing health and study-related topics with the participants.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOUTCOME MEASURES: The research team measured BP, heart rate, and HRV and administered the Profile of Mood States, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory-II to evaluate immediate and longer-term mood. The team had planned quantitative statistical analysis of the data at the study's initiation but did not complete it because the number of enrolled participants was too low for the analysis to be meaningful. The team visually examined the data, however, for trends that would indicate areas to examine further in a follow-up study.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Participants showed improved immediate mood (vigor-activity and friendliness) and increased HRV after the laughter intervention. Both the laughter and control interventions appeared to improve longer-term anxiety. Two participants awaiting a lung transplant dropped out of the study, and no adverse events occurred.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that laughter yoga may improve HRV and some aspects of mood, and this topic warrants further research.},

The aim of this study was to investigate associations of cardiac sympathetic dysinnervation (CSD; by (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy) with short-term heart rate variability (HRV) measured by traditional vs. complexity markers. ECG was measured in 31 diabetic patients during rest over a period of 5 minutes and HRV quantified in different domains (time and frequency domain, scaling properties, symbolic dynamics). (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy identified 16 patients with CSD. Resting heart rate was increased and HRV reduced in these patients. In a subgroup of 16 patients ECG was also measured during standing. Changes in several HRV measures upon standing demonstrated cardiac responsiveness to orthostatic stress. Strong correlations between HRV, measured during standing, and CSD were observed with metrics based on symbolic dynamics. In conclusion, HRV assessment during standing may be useful for assessing cardiac sympathetic dysinnervation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.},

abstract = {Background • The need for treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among combat veterans returning from Afghanistan and Iraq is a growing concern. PTSD has been associated with reduced cardiac coherence (an indica-tor of heart rate variability [HRVl) and deficits in early stage information processing (attention and immediate memory) in different studies. However, the co-occurrence of reduced coherence and cognition in combat veterans with PTSD has not been studied before. Primary Study Objective • A pilot study was undertaken to assess the covariance of coherence and information processing in combat veterans. An additional study goal was assessment of effects of HRV biofeedback (HRVB) on coherence and informa-tion processing in these veterans. Methods/Design • A two-group (combat veterans with and with-out PTSD), pre-post study of coherence and information process-ing was employed with baseline psychometric covariates. Setting • The study was conducted at a VA Medical Center outpatient mental health clinic. Participants • Five combat veterans from Iraq or Afghanistan with PTSD and five active-duty soldiers with comparable com-bat exposure who were without PTSD. Intervention • Participants met with an HRVB professional once weekly for 4 weeks and received visual feedback in HRV patterns while receiving training in resonance frequency breath-ing and positive emotion induction. Primary Outcome Measures • Cardiac coherence, word list learning, commissions (false alarms) in go-no go reaction time, digits backward. Results • Cardiac coherence was achieved in all participants, and the increase in coherence ratio was significant post-HRVB training. Significant improvements in the information process-ing indicators were achieved. Degree of increase in coherence was the likely mediator of cognitive improvement. Conclusion • Cardiac coherence is an index of strength of con-trol of parasympathetic cardiac deceleration in an individual that has cardinal importance for the individual's attention and af{\'{i}}{\'{e}}ct regulation.},

abstract = {Background: The relationship between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) functioning was investigated using baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). We hypothesized that individuals with PTSD would exhibit lower BRS than those without PTSD. Methods: Participants were 80 PTSD patients and 50 controls aged 18-68 years. All participants were smokers, many were veterans (55{\%}), and 60 were women. Beat-to-beat BP was collected during a 5-min baseline rest periods from which estimates of BRS were derived using the sequence method. Results: Women with PTSD exhibited lower BRS (M = 10.5, S.D. = 5.1) than women without PTSD (M = 14.6, S.D. = 10.7). For men, PTSD diagnosis was not associated with BRS, p {\textgreater} .05. Conclusions: Among women, PTSD was associated with reduced PNS functioning. Men with PTSD did not have attenuated BRS, which may be due to sample characteristics, such as age and combat veteran status. Reduced PNS activity may predispose women with PTSD to poorer cardiovascular health. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Determined whether psychological factors (PFs) are associated with heart rate variability (HRV), blood pressure variability (BPV), and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) among healthy Ss. A population-based sample of 71 men and 79 women (35-64 yrs of age) was studied. Five-minute supine recordings of ECG and beat-to-beat photoplethysmographic finger systolic arterial pressure and diastolic arterial pressure were obtained during paced breathing. Power spectra were computed using a fast Fourier transform for low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) powers. BRS was calculated by cross-spectral analysis of R-R interval and systolic arterial pressure variabilities. PFs were evaluated by 3 self-report questionnaires: the Brief Symptom Inventory, the shortened version of the Spielberger State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory, and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. PFs were not related to HRV. Anxiety was associated with decreased BRS and higher LF power of systolic arterial pressure variability. These associations were independent of age, gender, other psychological factors, heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Hostility was an independent correlate of increased LF power of diastolic arterial pressure and increased HF power of systolic arterial pressure variability.

abstract = {Inflammation is a risk factor for both depression and cardiovascular disease. Depressed mood is also a cardiovascular risk factor. To date, research into mechanisms through which inflammation impacts cardiovascular health rarely takes into account central effects on autonomic cardiovascular control, instead emphasizing direct effects of peripheral inflammatory responses on endothelial reactivity and myocardial function. However, brain responses to inflammation engage neural systems for motivational and homeostatic control and are expressed through depressed mood state and changes in autonomic cardiovascular regulation. Here we combined an inflammatory challenge, known to evoke an acute reduction in mood, with neuroimaging to identify the functional brain substrates underlying potentially detrimental changes in autonomic cardiovascular control.We first demonstrated that alterations in the balance of low to high frequency (LF/HF) changes in heart rate variability (a measure of baroreflex sensitivity) could account for some of the inflammation-evoked changes in diastolic blood pressure, indicating a central (rather than solely local endothelial) origin. Accompanying alterations in regional brain metabolism (measured using 18FDG-PET) were analysed to localise central mechanisms of inflammation-induced changes in cardiovascular state: three discrete regions previously implicated in stressor-evoked blood pressure reactivity, the dorsal anterior and posterior cingulate and pons, strongly mediated the relationship between inflammation and blood pressure. Moreover, activity changes within each region predicted the inflammation-induced shift in LF/HF balance. These data are consistent with a centrally-driven component originating within brain areas supporting stressor evoked blood pressure reactivity. Together our findings highlight mechanisms binding psychological and physiological well-being and their perturbation by peripheral inflammation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Exposure to ambient particles has been shown to be responsible for cardiovascular effects, especially in elderly with cardiovascular disease. The study assessed the association between deceleration capacity (DC) as well as heart rate variability (HRV) and ambient particulate matter (PM) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A prospective study with up to 12 repeated measurements was conducted in Erfurt, Germany, between October 2000 and April 2001 in 56 patients with physician-diagnosed ischemic heart disease, stable angina pectoris or prior myocardial infarction at an age of at least 50 years. Twenty-minute ECG recordings were obtained every two weeks and 24-hour ECG recordings every four weeks. Exposure to PM (size range from 10 nm to 2.5 $\mu$m), and elemental (EC) and organic (OC) carbon was measured. Additive mixed models were used to analyze the association between PM and ECG recordings.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The short-term recordings showed decrements in the high-frequency component of HRV as well as in RMSSD (root-mean-square of successive differences of NN intervals) in association with increments in EC and OC 0-23 hours prior to the recordings. The long-term recordings revealed decreased RMSSD and pNN50 ({\%} of adjacent NN intervals that differed more than 50 ms) in association with EC and OC 24-47 hours prior to the recordings. In addition, highly significant effects were found for DC which decreased in association with PM2.5, EC and OC concurrent with the ECG recordings as well as with a lag of up to 47 hours.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The analysis showed significant effects of ambient particulate air pollution on DC and HRV parameters reflecting parasympathetic modulation of the heart in patients with CAD. An air pollution-related decrease in parasympathetic tone as well as impaired heart rate deceleration capacity may contribute to an increased risk for cardiac morbidity and sudden cardiac death in vulnerable populations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart failure is associated with frequent hospitalizations, often resulting from volume overload. Measurement of intrathoracic impedance with an implanted device with an audible patient alert may detect increases in pulmonary fluid retention early. We hypothesized that early intervention could prevent hospitalizations and affect outcome. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 335 patients with chronic heart failure who had undergone implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator alone (18{\%}) or with cardiac resynchronization therapy (82{\%}). All devices featured a monitoring tool to track changes in intrathoracic impedance (OptiVol) and other diagnostic parameters. Patients were randomized to have information available to physicians and patients as an audible alert in case of preset threshold crossings (access arm) or not (control arm). The primary end point was a composite of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalizations. During 14.9±5.4 months, this occurred in 48 patients (29{\%}) in the access arm and in 33 patients (20{\%}) in the control arm (P=0.063; hazard ratio, 1.52; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.97-2.37). This was due mainly to more heart failure hospitalizations (hazard ratio, 1.79; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.08-2.95; P=0.022), whereas the number of deaths was comparable (19 versus 15; P=0.54). The number of outpatient visits was higher in the access arm (250 versus 84; P{\textless}0.0001), with relatively more signs of heart failure among control patients during outpatient visits. Although the trial was terminated as a result of slow enrollment, a post hoc futility analysis indicated that a positive result would have been unlikely. CONCLUSION: Use of an implantable diagnostic tool to measure intrathoracic impedance with an audible patient alert did not improve outcome and increased heart failure hospitalizations and outpatient visits in heart failure patients.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis has been shown to be a predictor of sudden cardiac death and all-cause mortality in patients with cardiac disease. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether newer HRV analysis algorithms, as used by the HeartTrends device, are superior to exercise stress testing (EST) for the detection of myocardial ischemia in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: We present pilot data of the first 100 subjects enrolled in a clinical trial designed to evaluate the yield of short-term (1 hour) HRV testing for the detection of myocardial ischemia. The study population comprised subjects without known CAD referred to a tertiary medical center for EST with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). All patients underwent a 1 hour electrocardiographic acquisition for HRV analysis with a HeartTrends device prior to ESTwith MPI. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) were calculated for EST and HRV analysis, using MPI as the gold standard for the non-invasive detection of myocardial ischemia. RESULTS: In this cohort 15{\%} had a pathologic MPI result. HRV analysis showed superior sensitivity (85{\%}), PPV (50{\%}) and NPV (97{\%}) as compared to standard EST (53{\%}, 42{\%}, 90{\%}, respectively), while the specificity of the two tests was similar (86{\%} and 85{\%}, respectively). The close agreement between HRV and MPI was even more pronounced among patients {\textgreater} 65 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot data suggest that the diagnostic yield of the novel HeartTrends HRV algorithm is superior to conventional EST for the non-invasive detection of myocardial ischemia.},

abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between depression and heart rate variability in cardiac patients. Methods: Heart rate variability was measured during 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring in 40 medically stable out-patients with documented coronary heart disease meeting current diagnostic criteria for major depression, and 32 nondepressed, but otherwise comparable, patients. Patients discontinued $\beta$-blockers and antidepressant medications at the time of study. Depressed patients were classified as mildly (n = 21) or moderately-to-severely depressed (n = 19) on the basis of Beck Depression Inventory scores. Results: There were no significant differences among the groups in age, gender, blood pressure, history of myocardial infarction, diabetes, or smoking. Heart rates were higher and nearly all indices of heart rate variability were significantly reduced in the moderately-to-severely versus the nondepressed group. Heart rates were also higher and mean values for heart rate variability lower in the mildly depressed group compared with the nondepressed group, but these differences did not attain statistical significance. Conclusion: The association of moderate to severe depression with reduced heart rate variability in patients with stable coronary heart disease may reflect altered cardiac autonomic modulation and may explain their increased risk for mortality.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the time course of autonomic nervous system activity preceding ambulatory ischemic events. BACKGROUND: Vagal withdrawal can produce myocardial ischemia and may be involved in the genesis of ambulatory ischemic events. We analyzed trajectories of heart rate variability (HRV) 1 h before and after ischemic events, and we examined the role of exercise and mental stress in preischemic autonomic changes. METHODS: Male patients with stable coronary artery disease (n = 19; 62.1 ± 9.3 years) underwent 48-h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Frequency domain HRV measures were assessed for 60 min before and after each of 68 ischemic events and during nonischemic heart rate-matched control periods. RESULTS: High-frequency HRV decreased from -60, -20 to -10 min before ischemic events (4.8 ± 1.3; 4.6 ± 1.3; 4.4 ± 1.2 In [ms2], respectively; p = 0.04) and further from -4, -2 min, until ischemia (4.4 ± 1.3; 4.1 ± 1.3; 3.7 ± 1.2 In [ms2]; p's {\textless} 0.01). Low frequency HRV decreases started at -4 min (p {\textless} 0.05). Ischemic events occurring at high mental activities were preceded by depressed high frequency HRV levels compared with events at low mental activity (p = 0.038 at -4 min, p = 0.045 at -2 min), whereas the effects of mental activities were not observed during nonischemic control periods. Heart rate variability measures remained significantly decreased for 20 min after recovery of ST-segment depression when events were triggered by high activity levels. CONCLUSIONS: Autonomic changes consistent with vagal withdrawal can act as a precipitating factor for daily life ischemia, particularly in episodes triggered by mental activities. {\textcopyright} 2001 by the American College of Cardiology.},

abstract = {Identification of genetic factors that influence stress reactivity is important in order to link environmental demands, particularly adversity to disease outcome. There is ample literature on genetic contribution to the endocrine stress response, while evidence for genetic contribution to individual differences in autonomic nervous system function is sparse and produced conflicting results. Here, we investigated the influence of two polymorphisms in the Catechol-o-methyltransferase (. COMT) and serotonin transporter (. 5-HTT; . SCL6A4) gene. We examined the autonomic stress response to the Trier Social Stress Test for Children in 115 children. Salivary $\alpha$-amylase (sAA) was obtained prior to the stressor and repeatedly during recovery as a marker of autonomic reactivity. Furthermore, heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) were monitored continuously. We found differences in ANS stress response associated with each polymorphism (all . p{\textless}. .05). Children with the L variant of 5-HTTLPR showed a higher increase and sharper recovery of sAA in response to stress than those with S variants. For HR, we found differences associated with . COMT, i.e. children carrying at least one met allele showed lower mean HR increase and slower HR recovery in response to the stressor compared to those with two val alleles (. p{\textless}. .001) as well as a significant decrease in heart rate variability (. p{\textless}. .05). Our findings indicate that these two polymorphisms do indeed influence the ANS response to stress. This study provides further evidence for the crucial role of genetic factors in the modulation of differences in the acute stress response during childhood. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Background: Decreased vagal activity after myocardial infarction results in reduced heart-rate variability and increased risk of death. To distinguish between vagal and sympathetic factors that affect heart-rate variability, we used a signal-processing algorithm to separately characterise deceleration and acceleration of heart rate. We postulated that diminished deceleration-related modulation of heart rate is an important prognostic marker. Our prospective hypotheses were that deceleration capacity is a better predictor of risk than left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN). Methods: We quantified heart rate deceleration capacity by assessing 24-h Holter recordings from a post-infarction cohort in Munich (n=1455). We blindly validated the prognostic power of deceleration capacity in post-infarction populations in London, UK (n=656), and Oulu, Finland (n=600). We tested our hypotheses by assessment of the area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve (AUC). Findings: During a median follow-up of 24 months, 70 people died in the Munich cohort and 66 in the London cohort. The Oulu cohort was followed-up for 38 months and 77 people died. In the London cohort, mean AUC of deceleration capacity was 0{\textperiodcentered}80 (SD 0{\textperiodcentered}03) compared with 0{\textperiodcentered}67 (0{\textperiodcentered}04) for LVEF and 0{\textperiodcentered}69 (0{\textperiodcentered}04) for SDNN. In the Oulu cohort, mean AUC of deceleration capacity was 0{\textperiodcentered}74 (0{\textperiodcentered}03) compared with 0{\textperiodcentered}60 (0{\textperiodcentered}04) for LVEF and 0{\textperiodcentered}64 (0{\textperiodcentered}03) for SDNN (p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001 for all comparisons). Stratification by dichotomised deceleration capacity was especially powerful in patients with preserved LVEF (p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001 in all cohorts). Interpretation: Impaired heart rate deceleration capacity is a powerful predictor of mortality after myocardial infarction and is more accurate than LVEF and the conventional measures of heart-rate variability. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The stratification of post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients at risk of sudden cardiac death remains important. The aim of the present study was to assess the prognostic value of novel T-wave morphology descriptors derived from resting 12-lead ECGs. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 280 consecutive post-MI patients, a 12-lead ECG was recorded before discharge, optically scanned, and digitized. For the present study, 5 T-wave morphology descriptors were automatically calculated after singular value decomposition of the ECG signal. The total cosine R-to-T (TCRT [describes the global angle between repolarization and depolarization wavefront]) and the T-wave loop dispersion were univariately associated (P:=0.0002 and P:{\textless}0.002, respectively, U: test) with 27 prospectively defined clinical events in 261 patients (mean follow-up 32+/-10 months). Kaplan-Meier event probability curves for strata above and below the median confirmed the strong risk discrimination by TCRT and T-wave loop dispersion (P:{\textless}0.003 and P:{\textless}0.001, respectively, log-rank test). On Cox regression analysis, with the entering of age, left ventricular ejection fraction, heart rate, QRS width, reperfusion therapy, beta-adrenergic-blocker treatment, and standard deviation of R-R intervals on 24-hour Holter monitoring, TCRT (P:{\textless}0.03) yielded independent predictive value, whereas T-wave loop dispersion was of borderline independence (P:=0.064). Heart rate (P:{\textless}0.02), left ventricular ejection fraction (P:{\textless}0.02), and reperfusion therapy (P:{\textless}0.02) also remained in the final model. CONCLUSIONS: Computerized T-wave morphology analysis of the 12-lead resting ECG permits independent assessment of post-MI risk and an improved risk stratification when combined with other risk markers.},

abstract = {Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) and increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are both predictors of coronary artery disease and correlate with each other. We examined whether these 2 phenotypes share a common genetic substrate and investigated the relations of the CRP gene polymorphisms with both CRP levels and HRV indexes. We examined 236 male twins free of symptomatic coronary artery disease, with a mean age ± SD of 54 ± 2.9 years. The plasma CRP levels were measured and the frequency domain measures of HRV were assessed using a 24-hour electrocardiographic recording, including ultra-low-, very-low-, low-, and high-frequency power. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CRP gene were genotyped. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association between CRP and HRV, as well as the genotype-phenotype association. Bivariate structural equation modeling was performed to estimate the genetic and environmental correlations between CRP and HRV and the explanatory effect of CRP gene polymorphisms on the CRP-HRV association. Both CRP (h2= 0.76) and HRV indexes (h2= 0.56 to 0.64) showed high heritability. Greater CRP levels were significantly associated with lower HRV. A robust genetic correlation was found between CRP and ultra-low-frequency power (rG= -0.3, p = 0.001). One CRP single nucleotide polymorphism (rs1205) was significantly associated with both CRP (p = 0.003) and ultra-low-frequency power (p = 0.005) and explained 11{\%} of the genetic covariance between them. In conclusion, reduced HRV correlates significantly with increased CRP plasma levels and this correlation is due, in large part, to common genetic influences. A polymorphism in the CRP gene contributes to both CRP levels and HRV. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {3 tobacco cigarettes with known content of nicotine and 1 lettuce-leaf cigarette were smoked by 24 paid, male medical students who were habitual smokers, at different times of day and at fixed rates of smoking. Changes in psychophysiological parameters were automatically recorded during the 60 min which followed smoking. Heart rate and forearm blood flow increases were dose dependent, the latter occurring only after smoking at the fast rate. Skin vasoconstriction, as measured by decreases in temperature, was more reactive to environmental stimuli than to drug effects. Significant increases in skin conductance levels lasting throughout the experimental session occurred immediately after smoking. Diphasic effects of nicotine were obtained with the 2 largest doses at different times of day. This finding is discussed in relation to possible unspecific nicotine effects upon a preexisting level of activation. Nicotine did not influence subjective time estimates. This is discussed in terms of disruption of the timing task and a gradual reorganization towards presmoking estimates. (32 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Background Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent in the general population and US veterans in particular and is associated with an increased risk of developing coronary artery disease (CAD). We compared the patient characteristics and postprocedural outcomes of veterans with and without PTSD undergoing coronary angiography. Methods This is a multicenter observational study of patients who underwent coronary angiography in Veterans Affairs hospitals nationally from October 2007 to September 2011. We described patient characteristics at angiography, angiographic results, and after coronary angiography, we compared risk-adjusted 1-year rates of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), and revascularization by the presence or absence of PTSD. Results Overall, of 116,488 patients undergoing angiography, 14,918 (12.8{\%}) had PTSD. Compared with those without PTSD, patients with PTSD were younger (median age 61.9 vs 63.7; P {\textless}.001), had higher rates of cardiovascular risk factors, and were more likely to have had a prior MI (26.4{\%} vs 24.7{\%}; P {\textless}.001). Patients with PTSD were more likely to present for stable angina (22.4{\%} vs 17.0{\%}) or atypical chest pain (58.5{\%} vs 48.6{\%}) and less likely to have obstructive CAD identified at angiography (55.9{\%} vs 62.2{\%}; P {\textless}.001). After coronary angiography, PTSD was associated with lower unadjusted 1-year rates of MI (hazard ratio (HR), 0.86; 95{\%} CI [0.75-1.00]; P = 0.04), revascularization (HR, 0.88; 95{\%} CI [0.83-0.93]; P {\textless}.001), and all-cause mortality (HR, 0.66; 95{\%} CI [0.60-0.71]; P {\textless}.001). After adjustment for cardiovascular risk, PTSD was no longer associated with 1-year rates of MI or revascularization but remained associated with lower 1-year all-cause mortality (HR, 0.91; 95{\%} CI [0.84-0.99]; P =.03). Findings were similar after further adjustment for depression, anxiety, alcohol or substance use disorders, and frequency of outpatient follow-up. Conclusions Among veterans undergoing coronary angiography in the Veterans Affairs, those with PTSD were more likely to present with elective indications and less likely to have obstructive CAD. After coronary angiography, PTSD was not associated with adverse 1-year outcomes of MI, revascularization, or all-cause mortality. {\textcopyright} 2014 Mosby, Inc.},

abstract = {Elevated psychosocial stress might favor the occurrence of cardiovascular disease; however, mechanisms are incompletely understood. We hypothesized that patients (n=126; 44+/-1 years of age) referred to an internal medicine clinic because of symptoms related to chronic psychosocial stress would demonstrate signs of autonomic dysregulation compared with controls (n=132; 42+/-1 years of age). We used autoregressive spectral analysis of RR interval variability to obtain indirect markers of sympathetic and of vagal (respectively, low-frequency and high-frequency components, both expressed in normalized units) oscillatory modulation of sinoatrial node, as well as of sympathetic vasomotor regulation (low-frequency component of systolic arterial pressure variability) and of cardiac baroreflex sensitivity (alpha-index). Higher values of systolic and diastolic arterial pressure (respectively, 124+/-1 versus 117+/-1 mm Hg and 80+/-1 versus 75+/-1 mm Hg; both P{\textless}0.001), altered markers of autonomic regulation (increased normalized low-frequency and reduced high-frequency component of RR variability, P{\textless}0.005; increased-low frequency component of systolic arterial pressure variability, P{\textless}0.002), and reduced baroreflex sensitivity (19.3+/-1.4 versus 23.0+/-2.0 ms/mm Hg; P{\textless}0.05) were observed in patients compared with controls. Autonomic responses to active standing were also blunted in stressed patients. Autonomic markers were significantly correlated to stress perception score and were capable of discriminating between controls and patients with a high degree of accuracy. Chronic real-life stress in humans appears associated to increased arterial pressure and to impaired autonomic regulation of cardiovascular functions. The combination of sympathetic predominance, vagal withdrawal, and blunted baroreflex sensitivity might represent a treatable mechanistic link between psychosocial factors and future incidence of hypertension.},

abstract = {Background. Experimental evidence suggests that autonomic markers such as heart-rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) may contribute to post-infarction risk stratification. There are clinical data to support this concept for heart-rate variability. The main objective of the ATRAMI study was to provide prospective data on the additional and independent prognostic value for cardiac mortality of heart-rate variability and BRS in patients after myocardial infarction in whom left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and ventricular arrhythmias were known. Methods. This multicentre international prospective study enrolled 1284 patients with a recent ({\textless} 28 days) myocardial infarction, 24 h Holter recording was done to quantify heart-rate variability (measured as standard deviation of normal to normal RR intervals [SDNN]) and ventricular arrhythmias. BRS was calculated from measurement of the rate-pressure response to intravenous phenylephrine. Findings. During 21 (SD 8) months of follow-up, the primary endpoint, cardiac mortality, included 44 cardiac deaths and five non-fatal cardiac arrests. Low values of either heart-rate variability (SDNN {\textless} 70 ms) or BRS ({\textless} 3.0 ms per mmHg) carried a significant multivariate risk of cardiac mortality (3.2 [95{\%} CI 1.42-7.36] and 2.8 [1.24-6.16], respectively). The association of low SDNN and BRS further increased risk; the 2-year mortality was 17{\%} when both were below the cut-offs and 2{\%} (p {\textless} 0.0001) when both were well preserved (SDNN {\textgreater} 105 ms, BRS {\textgreater} 6.1 ms per mmHg). The association of low SDNN or BRS with LVEF below 35{\%} carried a relative risk of 6.7 (3.1-14.6) or 8.7 (4.3-17.6), respectively, compared with patients with LVEF above 35{\%} and less compromised SDNN ≤ 70 ms) and BRS (≤ 3 ms per mmHg). Interpretation. ATRAMI provides clinical evidence that after myocardial infarction the analysis of vagal reflexes has significant prognostic value independently of LVEF and of ventricular arrhythmias acid that it significantly adds to the prognostic value of heart-rate variability.},

abstract = {Objectives The purpose of this study was to provide a meta-analysis to estimate the performance of 12 commonly reported risk stratification tests as predictors of arrhythmic events in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Background Multiple techniques have been assessed as predictors of death due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias/sudden death in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Methods Forty-five studies enrolling 6,088 patients evaluating the association between arrhythmic events and predictive tests (baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate turbulence, heart rate variability, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, left ventricular ejection fraction, electrophysiology study, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, left bundle branch block, signal-averaged electrocardiogram, fragmented QRS, QRS-T angle, and T-wave alternans) were included. Raw event rates were extracted, and meta-analysis was performed using mixed effects methodology. We also used the trim-and-fill method to estimate the influence of missing studies on the results. Results Patients were 52.8 ± 14.5 years of age, and 77{\%} were male. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 30.6 ± 11.4{\%}. Test sensitivities ranged from 28.8{\%} to 91.0{\%}, specificities from 36.2{\%} to 87.1{\%}, and odds ratios from 1.5 to 6.7. Odds ratio was highest for fragmented QRS and TWA (odds ratios: 6.73 and 4.66, 95{\%} confidence intervals: 3.85 to 11.76 and 2.55 to 8.53, respectively) and lowest for QRS duration (odds ratio: 1.51, 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.13 to 2.01). None of the autonomic tests (heart rate variability, heart rate turbulence, baroreflex sensitivity) were significant predictors of arrhythmic outcomes. Accounting for publication bias reduced the odds ratios for the various predictors but did not eliminate the predictive association. Conclusions Techniques incorporating functional parameters, depolarization abnormalities, repolarization abnormalities, and arrhythmic markers provide only modest risk stratification for sudden cardiac death in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. It is likely that combinations of tests will be required to optimize risk stratification in this population. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Clinical depression is associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients with a recent myocardial infarction (MI). Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) has been suggested as a possible explanation for this association. The purpose of this study was to determine if depression is associated with reduced HRV in patients with a recent MI. METHODS AND RESULTS Three hundred eighty acute MI patients with depression and 424 acute MI patients without depression were recruited. All underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring after hospital discharge. In univariate analyses, 4 indices of HRV were significantly lower in patients with depression than in patients without depression. Variables associated with HRV were then compared between patients with and without depression, and potential confounds were identified. These variables (age, sex, diabetes, and present cigarette smoking) were entered into an analysis of covariance model, followed by depression status. In the final model, all but one HRV index (high-frequency power) remained significantly lower in patients with depression than in patients without depression. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that greater autonomic dysfunction, as reflected by decreased HRV, is a plausible mechanism linking depression to increased cardiac mortality in post-MI patients.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was to evaluate differences in heart rate variability (HRV) among post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients, depending on their participation in the Croatian war and on established diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS: The study included 34 male war veterans with diagnosed PTSD who had suffered a first MI and 34 age-matched post-MI patients without PTSD. Cardiac autonomic balance was evaluated through HRV analysis. RESULTS: There were no differences in the mean R-R interval or overall HRV between the analyzed groups. Post-MI patients with PTSD had lower values for the square root of the mean of squared successive differences in R-R intervals (p = 0.02), the percentage of R-R intervals that were {\textgreater} or =50 milliseconds different from the previous interval (p = 0.03), and the high-frequency component (p = 0.03) but had higher values for the low-frequency component (p = 0.01) and the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio (p = 0.02), compared with post-MI patients without PTSD. CONCLUSION: Post-MI patients with PTSD have higher sympathetic and lower parasympathetic heart rate modulation activity, compared with patients with MI and no PTSD.},

abstract = {Chronic imbalance of the autonomic nervous system is a prevalent and potent risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events, including mortality. Although not widely recognized by clinicians, this risk factor is easily assessed by measures such as resting and peak exercise heart rate, heart rate recovery after exercise, and heart rate variability. Any factor that leads to inappropriate activation of the sympathetic nervous system can be expected to have an adverse effect on these measures and thus on patient outcomes, while any factor that augments vagal tone tends to improve outcomes. Insulin resistance, sympathomimetic medications, and negative psychosocial factors all have the potential to affect autonomic function adversely and thus cardiovascular prognosis. Congestive heart failure and hypertension also provide important lessons about the adverse effects of sympathetic predominance, as well as illustrate the benefits of $\beta$-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 2 classes of drugs that reduce adrenergic tone. Other interventions, such as exercise, improve cardiovascular outcomes partially by increasing vagal activity and attenuating sympathetic hyperactivity.},

abstract = {The predictive value of heart rate variability (HRV) in chronic heart failure (CHF) has never been tested in a comprehensive multivariate model using short-term laboratory recordings designed to avoid the confounding effects of respiration and behavioral factors. A multivariate survival model for the identification of sudden (presumably arrhythmic) death was developed with data from 202 consecutive patients referred between 1991 and 1995 with moderate to severe CHF (age 52±9 years, left ventricular ejection fraction 24±7{\%}, New York Heart Association class 2.3±0.7; the derivation sample). Time- and frequency-domain HRV parameters obtained from an 8′ recording of ECG at baseline and during controlled breathing (12 to 15 breaths/min) were challenged against clinical and functional parameters. This model was then validated in 242 consecutive patients referred between 1996 and 2001 (validation sample). In the derivation sample, sudden death was independently predicted by a model that included low-frequency power (LFP) of HRV during controlled breathing ≤13 ms2 and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter ≥77 mm (relative risk [RR] 3.7, 95{\%} CI 1.5 to 9.3, and RR 2.6, 95{\%} CI 1.0 to 6.3, respectively). The derivation model was also a significant predictor in the validation sample (P=0.04). In the validation sample, LFP ≤11 ms2 during controlled breathing and ≥83 ventricular premature contractions per hour on Holter monitoring were both independent predictors of sudden death (RR 3.0, 95{\%} CI 1.2 to 7.6, and RR 3.7, 95{\%} CI 1.5 to 9.0, respectively). Reduced short-term LFP during controlled breathing is a powerful predictor of sudden death in patients with CHF that is independent of many other variables. These results refine the identification of patients who may benefit from prophylactic implantation of a cardiac defibrillator.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to investigate associations between psychosocial risk factors, including social isolation, anger and depressive symptoms, and heart rate variability in healthy women. METHODS: The study group consisted of 300 healthy women (median age 57.5 years) who were representative of women living in the greater Stockholm area. For the measurement of social isolation, a condensed version of the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List was used and household size assessed. Anger was measured by the anger scales previously used in the Framingham study and depressive symptoms by a questionnaire derived from Pearlin. Health behaviors were measured by means of standard questionnaires. From 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, both time and frequency domain measures were obtained: SDNN index (mean of the SDs of all normal to normal intervals for all 5-minute segments of the entire recording), VLF power (very low frequency power), LF power (low frequency power), HF power (high frequency power), and the LF/HF ratio (low frequency by high frequency ratio) were computed. RESULTS: Social isolation and inability to relieve anger by talking to others were associated with decreased heart rate variability. Depressive symptoms were related only to the LF/HF ratio. Adjusting for age, menopausal status, exercise and smoking habits, history of hypertension, and BMI did not substantially change the results. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest heart rate variability to be a mediating mechanism that could explain at least part of the reported associations between social isolation, suppressed anger, and health outcomes.},

abstract = {The association of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with cardiovascular disease risk may be mediated by inflammation. Our objective was to examine the association between PTSD and measures of inflammation and to determine whether these associations are due to shared familial or genetic factors. We measured lifetime history of PTSD using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV in 238 male middle-aged military veteran twin pairs (476 individuals), selected from the Vietnam Era Twins Registry, who were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline. We assessed inflammation using levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), fibrinogen, white blood cells, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Geometric mean levels and percent differences by PTSD were obtained from mixed-model linear regression analyses with adjustment for potential confounders. Within-pair analysis was conducted to adjust for shared family environment and genetics (monozygotic pairs). Overall, 12.4{\%} of participants had a lifetime history of PTSD. Adjusted mean levels of hsCRP and ICAM-1 were significantly higher among those with vs. without PTSD [hsCRP: 1.75 vs. 1.31. mg/l (33{\%} difference); ICAM-1: 319 vs. 293. ng/ml (9{\%} difference)]. Adjustment for depression rendered the association of PTSD with hsCRP non-statistically significant. For IL-6, no consistent association was seen. Within-pair analysis produced associations that were similar in direction for all three markers but lesser in magnitude for hsCRP and IL-6. There was no evidence of interaction by zygosity. Elevated hsCRP and ICAM-1 are associated with PTSD, and these associations may be confounded by shared non-genetic, antecedent familial and environmental factors. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback is a self-regulation strategy used to improve conditions including asthma, stress, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Respiratory muscle function affects hemodynamic influences on respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and HRV and HRV-biofeedback protocols often include slow abdominal breathing to achieve physiologically optimal patterns of HRV with power spectral distribution concentrated around the 0.1-Hz frequency and large amplitude. It is likely that optimal balanced breathing patterns and ability to entrain heart rhythms to breathing reflect physiological efficiency and resilience and that individuals with dysfunctional breathing patterns may have difficulty voluntarily modulating HRV and RSA. The relationship between breathing movement patterns and HRV, however, has not been investigated. This study examines how individuals' habitual breathing patterns correspond with their ability to optimize HRV and RSA. METHOD: Breathing pattern was assessed using the Manual Assessment of Respiratory Motion (MARM) and the Hi Lo manual palpation techniques in 83 people with possible dysfunctional breathing before they attempted HRV biofeedback. Mean respiratory rate was also assessed. Subsequently, participants applied a brief 5-minute biofeedback protocol, involving breathing and positive emotional focus, to achieve HRV patterns proposed to reflect physiological "coherence" and entrainment of heart rhythm oscillations to other oscillating body systems. RESULTS: Thoracic-dominant breathing was associated with decreased coherence of HRV (r = -.463, P = .0001). Individuals with paradoxical breathing had the lowest HRV coherence (t(8) = 10.7, P = .001), and the negative relationship between coherence of HRV and extent of thoracic breathing was strongest in this group (r = -.768, P = .03). CONCLUSION: Dysfunctional breathing patterns are associated with decreased ability to achieve HRV patterns that reflect cardiorespiratory efficiency and autonomic nervous system balance. This suggests that dysfunctional breathing patterns are not only biomechanically inefficient but also reflect decreased physiological resilience. Breathing assessment using simple manual techniques such as the MARM and Hi Lo may be useful in HRV biofeedback to identify if poor responders require more emphasis on correction of dysfunctional breathing.},

abstract = {The dynamic interactions among physiological rhythms imbedded in the heart rate signal can give valuable insights into autonomic modulation in conditions of reduced outward attention. Therefore, in this study we analyzed the heart rate variability (HRV) in different levels of practice in Zen meditation (Zazen). Nineteen subjects with variable experience took part in this study. In four special cases we collected both HRV and respiration data. The time series were analyzed in frequency domain and also using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, which detects changes in the time domain and in the frequency domain simultaneously. The shifts in the respiratory modulation of heart rate, or respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), reflect the different levels of practice among practitioners with variable experience in Zazen; in turn the modulation of the RSA may reflect changes in the breathing pattern as in the parasympathetic outflow related to the quality and focus of attention in each stage.},

abstract = {Meditation refers to a family of practices that may share many similarities, but can have differences in underlying methods and goals. Religious and spiritual associations are common but are not requisite for meditation practice and it should be recognized that the basis of many if not all practices is the training of the brain and body, a process that appears to have profound effects on both structure and function. In recent decades there has been interest regarding the effects of these ancient practices on the cardiovascular system, as meditation has intuitive appeal for benefit in this area. Though there is a relative shortage of quality data, available evidence suggests that meditation may exert beneficial effects on autonomic tone, autonomic reflexes, and decrease blood pressure acutely and after long term practice. In addition, meditation has the potential to positively influence the cardiovascular system through the mind-heart connection and the anti-inflammatory reflex. There is limited but promising data to suggest that meditation based interventions can have beneficial effects on patients with established cardiovascular disease. More high quality and unbiased studies of meditation practices on relevant endpoints in cardiovascular disease are needed, including the effects of such practices on inflammation, baseline heart rate variability, arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Rationale: We validated heart rate (HR) and six time and six frequency domain measures of heart rate variability (HRV) as estimators of autonomic outflow in 44 young healthy male subjects. Gold standards for autonomic outflow were the Rosenblueth-Simeone factors m (sympathetic tone) and n (vagal tone), and the sympathovagal balance m{\textperiodcentered}n, determined by two-stage complete autonomic blockade. Methods: Rank correlations were computed between HR and the HRV measures obtained before autonomic blockade, and m, n and m{\textperiodcentered}n. Also, the maximal mean performances (averaged sensitivity and specificity) for HR and HRV as discriminators between low and high values of m, n or m{\textperiodcentered}n were computed. Results: The spectral HRV measures showed less good correlations and performances than the time domain HRV measures. Correlations with sympathetic tone were all below 0.31. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia during 15 cycles/min metronome breathing was superior in estimating vagal tone and sympathovagal balance (correlations -0.71/-0.73; both performances 0.82), heart rate scored similarly for assessing the sympathovagal balance (correlation 0.71; performance 0.82). Conclusions: It does not appear justified to evaluate HR or HRV in terms of sympathetic tone, vagal tone, or sympathovagal balance. HR and HRV are specifically weak in assessing sympathetic tone. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia during 15 cycles/min metronome breathing is superior in assessing vagal tone. Current HRV analysis techniques offer no advantages compared with HR in assessing the sympathovagal balance.},

abstract = {Psychological depression is shown to be associated with several aspects of coronary artery disease (CAD), including arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, heart failure and sudden death. The physiological mechanisms accounting for this association are unclear. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal dysregulation, diminished heart rate variability, altered blood platelet function and noncompliance with medial treatments have been proposed as mechanisms underlying depression and cardiovascular disease. Recent evidence also suggests that reduced baroreflex sensitivity, impaired immune function, chronic fatigue and the co-morbidity of depression and anxiety may be involved in the relationship between depression and cardiovascular dysregulation. An experimental strategy using animal models for investigating underlying physiological abnormalities in depression is presented. A key to understanding the bidirectional association between depression and heart disease is to determine whether there are common changes in brain systems that are associated with these conditions. Such approaches may hold promise for advancing our understanding of the interaction between this mood disorder and CAD. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Objectives: We determined the contribution of multiple variables to predict arrhythmic death and total mortality risk in patients with coronary disease and left ventricular dysfunction. We then constructed an algorithm to predict risk of mortality and sudden death. Background: Many factors in addition to ejection fraction (EF) influence the prognosis of patients with coronary disease. However, there are few tools to use this information to guide clinical decisions. Methods: We evaluated the relationship between 25 variables and total mortality and arrhythmic death in 674 patients enrolled in the MUSTT (Multicenter Unsustained Tachycardia Trial) study that did not receive antiarrhythmic therapy. We then constructed risk-stratification algorithms to weight the prognostic impact of each variable on arrhythmic death and total mortality risk. Results: The variables having the greatest prognostic impact in multivariable analysis were functional class, history of heart failure, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia not related to bypass surgery, EF, age, left ventricular conduction abnormalities, inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia, enrollment as an inpatient, and atrial fibrillation. The model demonstrates that patients whose only risk factor is EF ≤30{\%} have a predicted 2-year arrhythmic death risk {\textless}5{\%}. Conclusions: Multiple variables influence arrhythmic death and total mortality risk. Patients with EF ≤30{\%} but no other risk factor have low predicted mortality risk. Patients with EF {\textgreater}30{\%} and other risk factors may have higher mortality and a higher risk of sudden death than some patients with EF ≤30{\%}. Thus, risk of sudden death in patients with coronary disease depends on multiple variables in addition to EF. {\textcopyright} 2007 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of the predictive value of microvolt T-wave alternans (MTWA) testing for arrhythmic events in a wide variety of populations. BACKGROUND: Previous studies describing the use of MTWA as a predictor of ventricular tachyarrhythmic events have been limited by small sample sizes and disparate populations. METHODS: Prospective studies of the predictive value of exercise-induced MTWA published between January 1990 and December 2004 were retrieved. Data from each article were abstracted independently by two authors using a standardized protocol. Summary estimates of the predictive value of MTWA were made using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Data were accumulated from 19 studies (2,608 subjects) across a wide range of populations. Overall, the positive predictive value of MTWA for arrhythmic events was 19.3{\%} at an average of 21 months' follow-up (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 17.7{\%} to 21.0{\%}), the negative predictive value was 97.2{\%} (95{\%} CI 96.5{\%} to 97.9{\%}), and the univariate relative risk of an arrhythmic event was 3.77 (95{\%} CI 2.39 to 5.95). There was no difference in predictive value between ischemic and nonischemic heart failure subgroups. The positive predictive value varied depending on the population of patients studied (p {\textless} 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Microvolt T-wave alternans testing has significant value for the prediction of ventricular tachyarrhythmic events; however, there are significant limitations to its use. The predictive value of MTWA varies significantly depending on the population studied. Careful standardization is needed for what constitutes abnormal MTWA. The incremental prognostic value of MTWA when used with other methods of risk stratification is unclear. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {AIMS: Dyx is a new heart rate variability (HRV) density analysis specifically designed to identify patients at high risk for malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The aim of this study was to test if Dyx can improve risk stratification for malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias and to test if the previously identified cut-off can be reproduced. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 248 patients from the CARISMA study with ejection fraction ≤40{\%} after an acute myocardial infarction and an analysable 24 h Holter recording. All patients received an implantable cardiac monitor, which was used to diagnose the primary endpoint of near-fatal or fatal ventricular tachyarrhythmias likely preventable by an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), during a period of 2 years. A Dyx ≤ 1.96 was considered abnormal. The secondary endpoint was cardiovascular death. At enrolment 59 patients (24{\%}) had a Dyx ≤ 1.96 and 20 experienced a primary endpoint. A Dyx ≤ 1.96 was associated with a significantly increased risk for malignant arrhythmias [hazards ratio (HR) = 4.36 (1.81–10.52), P = 0.001] and cardiovascular death [HR = 3.47 (1.38–8.74), P = 0.008]. Compared with important clinical risk parameters (age {\textgreater}70 years and QRS {\textgreater} 120 ms), Dyx ≤ 1.96 significantly added predictive value (P = 0.0066). CONCLUSIONS: Dyx was a better predictor of ventricular tachyarrhythmias than the traditional measures of HRV and heart rate turbulence, particularly in the elderly. Dyx might be a useful tool for better selection of ICD candidates in the elderly population, since a normal Dyx in this group was associated with a very low risk for malignant ventricular arrhythmias.

abstract = {Power spectral analysis of the beat-to-beat variations of heart rate or the heart period (R–R interval) has become widely used to quantify cardiac autonomic regulation (Appel et al., 1989; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Denver et al., 2007; Thayler et al., 2010; Billman, 2011). This technique partitions the total variance (the “power”) of a continuous series of beats into its frequency components, typically identifying two or three main peaks: Very Low Frequency (VLF) {\textless}0.04 Hz, Low Frequency (LF), 0.04–0.15 Hz, and High Frequency (HF) 0.15–0.4 Hz. It should be noted that the HF peak is shifted to a higher range (typically 0.24–1.04 Hz) in infants and during exercise (Berntson et al., 1997). The HF peak is widely believed to reflect cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity while the LF, although more complex, is often assumed to have a dominant sympathetic component (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Billman, 2011). Based upon these assumptions, Pagani and co-workers proposed that the ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF) could be used to quantify the changing relationship between sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activities (i.e., the sympatho-vagal balance) (Pagani et al., 1984, 1986; Malliani et al., 1991) in both health and disease. However, this concept has been challenged (Kingwell et al., 1994; Koh et al., 1994; Hopf et al., 1995; Eckberg, 1997; Houle and Billman, 1999; Billman, 2011). Despite serious and largely under-appreciated limitations, the LF/HF ratio has gained wide acceptance as a tool to assess cardiovascular autonomic regulation where increases in LF/HF are assumed to reflect a shift to “sympathetic dominance” and decreases in this index correspond to a “parasympathetic dominance.” Therefore, it is vital to provide a critical assessment of the assumptions upon which this concept is based.},

Maximal heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) and T-wave peak-to-end (TpTe) intervals and QRS, QT, JT, QTapex, and TpTe dispersions and variation coefficients were measured manually and calculated from 12-lead ECGs obtained on admission. Clinical, radiological, and 2-dimensional echocardiographic data were also recorded. Primary end points were all-cause, Chagas' disease-related, and sudden cardiac mortalities. During a follow-up of 58+/-39 months, 62 patients died, 54 of Chagas' disease-related causes and 40 suddenly. Multivariate Cox survival analysis revealed that the QT-interval dispersion (QTd) (hazard ratio, 1.45; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.29 to 1.63; P{\textless}0.001, for 10-ms increments) and left ventricular (LV) end-systolic dimension (hazard ratio, 1.36; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.21 to 1.53; P{\textless}0.001, for 5-mm increments) were the strongest independent predictors for all end points. The maximum QTc interval (QTcmax) could substitute for QTd with a worse predictive performance. Other predictors were heart rate, presence of pathological Q waves, frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and isolated left anterior fascicular block (LAFB) on the ECGs. Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated that a QTd {\textgreater} or =65 ms or a QTcmax {\textgreater} or =465 ms1/2 discriminated the 2 groups with significantly different prognoses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Electrocardiographic QTd and echocardiographic LV end-systolic dimension were the most important mortality predictors in patients with Chagas' disease.

abstract = {Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been linked to increased morbidity. An inflexibility of the autonomic nervous system might be the underlying mechanism. We aimed to assess whether PTSD and combat trauma exposure are associated with lower heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function and a predictor of death. Methods: We measured HRV by power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram in 459 middle-aged veteran male twins. Combat trauma was assessed with the combat exposure scale, and current and remitted PTSD was assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders. Mixed-effects regression models were used to test associations of PTSD and HRV between and within twin pairs. Results: Of all twins, 211 had combat exposure, 31 had current PTSD, and 43 had remitted PTSD. Current PTSD was inversely associated with very-low-frequency and low-frequency HRV both in individual twins and within 20 pairs discordant for current PTSD. Twins with current PTSD had a 49{\%} lower low-frequency HRV than their brothers without PTSD (p{\textless}.001). Remitted PTSD was not associated with HRV. Results were robust to adjustment for depression and other risk factors. Combat exposure was inversely associated with most HRV frequencies, but this association mostly diminished after adjustment for current PTSD. Conclusion: In middle-aged veteran men, combat exposure and current PTSD are associated with measures of autonomic inflexibility previously shown to have prognostic significance. The negative health impact of combat exposure on autonomic function is mediated largely through PTSD and might reverse with remission of PTSD. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

Lifetime major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease were also assessed. Plasma C-reactive protein and interleukin 6 were measured to determine levels of inflammation. Mixed-effects regression models with a random intercept for pair were used to separate between- and within-twin pair effects.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: When twins were analyzed as individuals, increasing levels of early trauma were positively related to C-reactive protein (p = .03) but not to interleukin 6 (p = .12). When estimating within- and between-pair effects, only the between-pair association of early trauma with the inflammatory markers remained significant.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The link between early trauma and inflammation is largely explained by familial factors shared by the twins because levels of inflammation were highest when both twins were exposed to trauma. Exposure to early trauma may be a marker for an unhealthy familial environment. Clarification of familial factors associated with early stress and adult inflammation will be important to uncover correlates of stress and disease.},

abstract = {Abstract CONTEXT: Major depressive disorder (MDD) associated with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) increases the risk of mortality. Decreased heart rate variability (HRV), also a predictor of mortality, is reduced in patients with MDD after ACS, and has been suggested to be a mediator of MDD mortality after ACS. Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may reduce mortality post-ACS, little is known about their effects on HRV. OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of both sertraline and improvement in mood on HRV. METHODS: The Sertraline Antidepressant Heart Attack Randomized Trial assessed HRV from 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram recordings at baseline in 290 patients and from a second recording in 258 of these patients 16 weeks after randomization to sertraline or placebo. Frequency domain measures of HRV included high-frequency power, low-frequency power, very low-frequency power, ultra low-frequency power, and total power. Depression severity was measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Clinical response was measured with the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement scale. RESULTS: At baseline, prior episodes of MDD were associated with lower HRV. Sertraline significantly increased ultra low-frequency power, while improvement in mood was associated with higher low-frequency power independent of treatment. However, the expected recovery in HRV following ACS was not observed in patients with MDD. Higher ultra low-frequency during sertraline treatment and higher low-frequency power in patients whose mood improved resulted primarily from these measures decreasing in their comparison groups. CONCLUSIONS: Heart rate variability recovery is impaired in depressed patients after ACS. Previously reported differences in baseline HRV between patients with and without depression after ACS grew larger in the 16 weeks following a coronary event. Both sertraline treatment and symptomatic recovery from depression were associated with increased HRV compared with placebo-treated and nonrecovered post-ACS control groups, respectively, but this results primarily from decreased HRV in the comparison groups.Publication Type Comparative Study.

Our aim was to compare changes in various biomarkers in CAD patients and age-matched healthy male subjects during "real-life" emotional excitement. Enthusiastic male ice hockey spectators (CAD n = 18, healthy subjects n = 16) attended Finnish national ice hockey play-off matches. Heart rate variability, plasma catecholamines, endothelin-1 (ET-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were determined at the baseline and during the match. A significantly more marked increase in both ET-1 and IL-6 was observed in CAD patients compared with healthy subjects during the match (time × group interaction p = 0.009 and p = 0.018 for ET-1 and IL-6, respectively). The high-frequency power of R-R intervals decreased in CAD patients (p {\textless} 0.001) but did not change in healthy subjects (p = ns, time × group interaction p {\textless} 0.001). Changes in adrenaline and noradrenaline did not differ between the groups.

abstract = {Objectives To determine if cardiorespiratory biofeedback increases heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with documented coronary artery disease (CAD). Background Diminished HRV has been associated with increased cardiac morbidity and mortality. Evidence suggests that various lifestyle changes and pharmacologic therapies can improve HRV. The objective of this study was to determine if biofeedback increases HRV in patients with CAD. Methods Patients with established CAD (n = 63; mean age, 67 years) were randomly assigned to conventional therapy or to 6 biofeedback sessions consisting of abdominal breath training, heart and respiratory physiologic feedback, and daily breathing practice. HRV was measured by the standard deviation of normal-to-normal QRS complexes (SDNN) at week 1 (pretreatment), week 6 (after treatment), and week 18 (follow-up). Results Baseline characteristics were similar for the treatment and control groups. The SDNN for the biofeedback and control groups did not differ at baseline or at week 6 but were significantly different at week 18. The biofeedback group showed a significant increase in SDNN from baseline to week 6 (P {\textless} .001) and to week 18 (P = .003). The control subjects had no change from baseline to week 6 (P = .214) and week 18 (P = .27). Conclusions Biofeedback increases HRV in patients with CAD and therefore may be an integral tool for improving cardiac morbidity and mortality rates.},

abstract = {Binaural beats are an auditory illusion perceived when two or more pure tones of similar frequencies are presented dichotically through stereo headphones. Although this phenomenon is thought to facilitate state changes (e.g., relaxation), few empirical studies have reported on whether binaural beats produce changes in autonomic arousal. Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of binaural beating on autonomic dynamics [heart rate variability (HRV)] during post-exercise relaxation. Subjects (n = 21; 18-29 years old) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study during which binaural beats and placebo were administered over two randomized and counterbalanced sessions (within-subjects repeated-measures design). At the onset of each visit, subjects exercised for 20-min; post-exercise, subjects listened to either binaural beats ('wide-band' theta-frequency binaural beats) or placebo (carrier tones) for 20-min while relaxing alone in a quiet, low-light environment. Dependent variables consisted of high-frequency (HF, reflecting parasympathetic activity), low-frequency (LF, reflecting sympathetic and parasympathetic activity), and LF/HF normalized powers, as well as self-reported relaxation. As compared to the placebo visit, the binaural-beat visit resulted in greater self-reported relaxation, increased parasympathetic activation and increased sympathetic withdrawal. By the end of the 20-min relaxation period there were no observable differences in HRV between binaural-beat and placebo visits, although binaural-beat associated HRV significantly predicted subsequent reported relaxation. Findings suggest that listening to binaural beats may exert an acute influence on both LF and HF components of HRV and may increase subjective feelings of relaxation.},

abstract = {Cardiac autonomic activity, as assessed by heart rate variability, has been found to be associated with postmyocardial infarction mortality, sudden death, and all-cause mortality. However, the association of heart rate variability and the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) is not well described. The authors report on the association of baseline cardiac autonomic activity (1987–1989) with incident CHD after 3 years (1990–1992) of follow-up of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study cohort selected from four study centers in the United States by using a case-cohort design. The authors examined 137 incident cases of CHD and a stratified random sample of 2, 252 examinees free of CHD at baseline. Baseline, supine, resting beat-to-beat heart rate data were collected. High- (0.16–0.35 Hz) and low- (0.025–0.15 Hz) frequency spectral powers and high-/low-frequency power ratio, estimated from spectral analysis, and standard deviation of all normal R-R intervals, calculated from time domain analysis, were used as the conventional indices of cardiac parasym-pathetic, sympatho-parasympathetic, and their balance, respectively. Incident CHD was defined sis hospitalized myocardial infarction, fatal CHD, or cardiac revascularization procedures during 3 years of follow-up. The age, race, gender, and other CHD risk factor-adjusted relative risks (and 95{\%} confidence intervals) of incident CHD comparing the lowest quartile with the upper three quartiles of high-frequency power, low-frequency power, high-/low-frequency power ratio, and standard deviation of R-R intervals were 1.72 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.17–2.51), 1.09 (95{\%} CI 0.72–1.64), 1.25 (95{\%} CI 0.84–1.86), and 1.39 (95{\%} CI 0.94–2.04), respectively. The findings from this population-based, prospective study suggest that altered cardiac autonomic activity, especially lower parasympathetic activity, is associated with the risk of developing CHD.

abstract = {Power spectral analysis (PSA) of heart rate variability (HRV) offers reliable assessment of cardiovascular autonomic responses, providing a 'window' onto the interaction of peripheral sympathetic and parasympathetic tone. Alterations in HRV are associated with various physiological and pathophysiological processes, and may contribute to morbidity and mortality. Previous studies of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) found lower resting HRV in patients compared to controls, suggesting increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic tone. This article describes the analysis of HRV at rest and after psychological stress in panic disorder (PD) patients, in an enlarged sample of PTSD patients, and in healthy control subjects. Standardized heart rate (HR) analysis was carried out in 14 PTSD patients, 11 PD patients and 25 matched controls. ECG recordings were made while subjects were resting ('rest 1'), while recalling the trauma implicated in PTSD, or the circumstances of a severe panic attack, as appropriate ('recall'), and again while resting ('rest 2'). Controls were asked to recall a stressful life event during recall. While both patient groups had elevated HR and low frequency (LF) components of HRV at baseline (suggesting increased sympathetic activity), PTSD patients, unlike PD patients and controls, failed to respond to the recall stress with increases in HR and LF. HRV analysis demonstrates significant differences in autonomic regulation of PTSD and PD patients compared to each other and to control subjects. HRV analysis may augment biochemical studies of peripheral measures in these disorders. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {An increasing number of studies has tested whether greater cardiovascular responses to acute mental stress predict future cardiovascular disease, but results have been variable. This review aimed quantitatively to evaluate the association between cardiovascular responses to laboratory mental stress and subsequent cardiovascular risk status in prospective cohort studies. We searched general bibliographic databases, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and PubMed, up to December 2009. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, quality, and estimates of associations. There were 169 associations (36 articles) of stress reactivity and 30 associations (5 articles) of poststress recovery in relation to future cardiovascular risk status, including elevated blood pressure, hypertension, left ventricular mass, subclinical atherosclerosis, and clinical cardiac events. The overall meta-analyses showed that greater reactivity to and poor recovery from stress were associated longitudinally with poor cardiovascular status (r=0.091 [95{\%} CI: 0.050 to 0.132], P{\textless}0.001, and r=0.096 [95{\%} CI: 0.058 to 0.134], P{\textless}0.001, respectively). These findings were supported by more conservative analyses of aggregate effects and by subgroup analyses of the methodologically strong associations. Notably, incident hypertension and increased carotid intima-media thickness were more consistently predicted by greater stress reactivity and poor stress recovery, respectively, whereas both factors were associated with higher future systolic and diastolic blood pressures. In conclusion, the current meta-analysis suggests that greater responsivity to acute mental stress has an adverse effect on future cardiovascular risk status, supporting the use of methods of managing stress responsivity in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease.},

abstract = {Introduction: Studies evaluating changes in HRV preceding the onset of ventricular arrhythmias using conventional techniques have shown inconsistent results. Time-frequency analysis of HRV is traditionally performed using short-term Fourier transform (STFT). Wavelet transform (WT) may however be better suited for analyzing non-stationary signals such as heart rate recordings. Methods and results: We studied patients with a history of myocardial infarction implanted with a defibrillator with an extended memory. The RR intervals during the 51 min preceding ventricular events requiring electrical therapy were retrieved, and HRV studied by WT and STFT. 111 episodes of ventricular arrhythmia were retrieved from 41 patients (38 males, age 64 ± 8 years). Heart rate increased significantly before arrhythmia. There was no significant variation in low frequency/high frequency components (LF/HF) observed for the group as a whole, probably due to a great degree of heterogeneity amongst individuals. A subset of 30 patients also had heart rate recordings performed during normal ICD follow-up. WT did not show any difference in HRV before arrhythmia onset and during control conditions. Conclusion: Variations in HRV before onset of ventricular arrhythmias were not apparent in this large dataset, despite use of optimal tools for studying time-frequency analysis. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Objectives: To examine the effects of psychological stress on QT dispersion (QTd) among CAD patients and whether these effects are mediated via the development of myocardial ischemia. Methods: Psychological stress was induced using a public speaking task. Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) were recorded at rest, during mental stress, and during recovery. QTd was calculated as the difference between the longest and the shortest QT interval in the 12-lead ECG. Rest-stress myocardial perfusion imaging was also performed to detect mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia. Results: Mental stress induced a significant increase in QTd compared to the resting condition (P {\textless} 0.001). This effect persisted beyond the first 10 minutes of recovery (P {\textless} 0.001). QTd was significantly associated with the development of mental stress ischemia with ischemic patients having significantly higher QTd during mental stress than nonischemic patients (P = 0.006). This finding remained significant after controlling for possible confounding factors (P = 0.01). Conclusion: An acute psychological stress induces a significant increase in QTd, which persists for more than 10 minutes after the cessation of the stressor. This effect seems to be, at least partially, mediated by the development of mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia. (PACE 2009; 32:1178-1183).},

abstract = {Whether autonomic dysfunction predates the development of symptomatic heart failure (HF) or is simply a consequence of severe HF is unknown. We hypothesized that reduced heart rate variability (a marker of abnormal autonomic function) at baseline is associated with incident HF in subjects free of clinically recognized cardiovascular disease. In the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a population-based study of subclinical cardiovascular disease in adults aged 45 to 84 years, we measured the heart rate variability using a standard 30-second, 12-lead electrocardiogram to measure the standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences in RR intervals (RMSSD). During a median follow-up of 7.6 years, 95 participants developed HF (incidence rate 2.7/1,000 person-years). After adjusting for age, gender, and ethnicity, the hazard ratio for incident HF stratified by the RMSSD tertile was 2.4 (95{\%} confidence interval 1.4 to 4.2) for the lowest tertile and 1.7 (95{\%} confidence interval 1.0 to 3.2) for the middle tertile (highest tertile was the referent group; p for trend {\textless}0.001). The inverse association between the RMSSD and incident HF persisted after adjustment for additional covariates, including diabetes, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, subclinical atherosclerosis, left ventricular end-systolic volume, interim myocardial infarction, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (p for trend = 0.009). A similarly significant inverse association was also observed for SDNN. In conclusion, baseline autonomic dysfunction was a risk factor for the development of HF in a multiethnic cohort. These population-based findings implicate autonomic dysfunction in the pathogenesis of HF, and decreased short-term heart rate variability might be a novel form of stage B (asymptomatic) HF. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Changes in measures of heart rate variability (HRV) have been associated with an increased risk for sudden cardiac death. The mechanisms underlying this association are not known. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between the amount of norepinephrine (NE) released from the cardiac sympathetic terminals and short-term HRV. The study comprised 8 healthy subjects, 12 patients with major depression, and 7 patients with panic disorder. Cardiac NE spillover was determined using direct coronary sinus blood sampling coupled with an NE isotope dilution methodology. Short-term HRV was quantified using detrended fluctuation analysis, symbolic dynamics, sample entropy, and standard time and frequency domain measures. Neither HRV nor cardiac NE spillover was significantly different between the analyzed groups. None of the standard HRV metrics was significantly correlated with cardiac NE spillover, but there was a moderate correlation between two complexity measures of HRV (symbolic dynamics) and cardiac NE spillover (patterns with 2 like variations, r = -0.37 and P = 0.05; and patterns with no variations: r = 0.34 and P = 0.06). In conclusion, there is no correlation between standard HRV measures and cardiac NE spillover in humans. Short-term complexity of heart rate is only moderately affected by sympathetic neural outflow. Therefore, the predictive value of most HRV measures for sudden cardiac death may predominantly result from their capacity to capture vagally mediated heart rate modulations.},

abstract = {We present the phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA) method as an efficient technique for the study of quasi-periodic oscillations in noisy, nonstationary signals. It allows the assessment of system dynamics despite phase resetting and noise and in relation with either increases or decreases of the considered signal. We employ the method to study the quasi-periodicities of the human heart rate based on long-term ECG recordings. The center deflection of the PRSA curve characterizes the average capacity of the heart to decelerate (or accelerate) the cardiac rhythm. It can be measured by a central wavelet coefficient which we denote as deceleration capacity (DC). We find that decreased DC is a more precise predictor of mortality in survivors of heart attack than left ventricular ejection fraction, the current "gold standard" risk predictor. In addition, we discuss the dependence of the DC parameter on age and on diabetes.},

Resting, supine, 2-minute, beat-to-beat heart rate data were collected between 7 A.M. and 12 noon. The race- and sexadjusted geometric means of low-frequency component (If, 0.025 to 0.15 Hz) were 4.00 and 3.13 (beats/min)2; of high-frequency component (HF, 0.16 to 0.35 Hz), 1.65 and 1.21 (beats/min)2; and of the HF LF ratio, 0.41 and 0.39, for 45-to-54 and 55-to-64 years age groups, respectively (test of mean difference by age, p {\textless} 0.01, p {\textless} 0.01, and p = 0.11 for if, HF, and HF LF ratio, respectively). Comparing black with white examinees, the age- and sex-adjusted geometric means of LF were 3.06 and 3.70 (beats/min)2; of HF, 1.66 and 1.36 (beats/min)2; of HF LF, 0.54 and 0.37, respectively (test of mean difference by race, p {\textless} 0.01, p {\textless} 0.01, and p {\textless} 0.01). The age- and race-adjusted geometric means of LF for women and men were 3.12 and 4.10 (beats/min)2; of HF, 1.46 and 1.38 (beats/min)2; and of HF LF, 0.47 and 0.34, respectively (test of mean difference, p {\textless} 0.01, p = 0.34, and p {\textless} 0.01). We conclude that HRV spectral indexes are associated with age, race, and sex. With increasing age, the parasympathetic and sympathetic spectral power components decrease. Black examinees have a lower LF, higher HF, and higher HF LF ratio than whites. Women have a lower LF, and a higher HF LF ratio than men. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

However, these results are not entirely consistent with current models of differential cerebral involvement in the modulation of the heart. This study was designed to re-investigate this topic with a larger N than has heretofore been used. Methods: The electrocardiogram was recorded during left and right ISAs in 73 subjects. Raw heart rate and heart rate variability were calculated. Results: Raw heart rate increased during inactivation of either hemisphere, but more so for the right hemisphere. Heart rate variability changes consistent with decreasing parasympa-thetic tone also were found to occur during either ISA, but to a significant degree, only during right ISA. Conclusions: The right hemisphere appears to have a greater role in cerebral regulation of cardiac function, perhaps by virtue of the modification of parasympathetic effects.},

abstract = {Patients with panic disorder provide a clinical model of stress. On a "good day," free from a panic attack, they show persistent stress-related changes in sympathetic nerve biology, including abnormal sympathetic nerve single-fiber firing ("salvos" of multiple firing within a cardiac cycle) and release of epinephrine as a cotransmitter. The coreleased epinephrine perhaps originates from in situ synthesis by phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT). In searching for biological evidence that essential hypertension is caused by mental stress--a disputed proposition--we note parallels with panic disorder, which provides an explicit clinical model of stress: (1) There is clinical comorbidity; panic disorder prevalence is increased threefold in essential hypertension. (2) For both, epinephrine cotransmission is present in sympathetic nerves. (3) In panic disorder and essential hypertension, but not in health, single-fiber sympathetic nerve firing salvos occur. (4) Tissue nerve growth factor is increased in both conditions (nerve growth factor is a stress reactant). (5) There is induction of PNMT in sympathetic nerves. Essential hypertension exhibits a further manifestation of mental stress: there is activation of noradrenergic brain stem neurons projecting to the hypothalamus and amygdala. These pathophysiological findings strongly support the view that chronic mental stress is important in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension. A hypothesis now under test is whether in both disorders, under prevailing conditions of ongoing stress, PNMT induced in sympathetic nerves acts as a DNA methylase, causing the norepinephrine transporter (NET) gene silencing that is present in both conditions. PNMT can have an intranuclear distribution, binding to DNA. We have demonstrated that the reduced neuronal noradrenaline reuptake present in both disorders does have an epigenetic mechanism, with demonstrable reduction in the abundance of the transporter protein, the NET gene silencing being associated with DNA binding by the methylation-related inhibitory transcription factor MeCP2.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to test prospectively in a population sample whether individuals with impaired heart rate variability (HRV) are at increased risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) and of non-CHD mortality and to test whether this relationship is more pronounced among individuals with diabetes. We examined the association between HRV and incident CHD and non-CHD mortality in a cohort of 11,654 men and women aged 45-64 years at intake, from the biracial, population-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. Supine, resting, 2-min beat-to-beat heart rate data were collected at the baseline examination. High frequency (HF; 0.15-0.40 Hz) and low frequency (LF; 0.04-0.15 Hz) spectral powers, LF/HF ratio, normalized HF and LF, the standard deviation of all normal R-R intervals (SDNN), and the mean of the sum of the squared differences between adjacent normal R-R intervals (MSSD) were used as the conventional indexes of HRV to measure cardiac autonomic control. From this cohort, 635 cases of incident CHD (including 346 cases of incident myocardial infarction [MI] and 82 cases of fatal CHD), and 623 non-CHD deaths were identified and validated after an average of 8 years of follow-up. Among individuals with diabetes, the multivariable adjusted proportional hazards ratios (95{\%} CI) were 2.03 (1.28-3.23), 1.60 (1.12-2.27), 1.50 (0.65-3.42), and 1.27 (0.84-1.91) for incident MI, incident CHD, fatal CHD, and non-CHD deaths, respectively, comparing the lowest quartile to the upper most three quartiles of HF. A similar pattern of associations was found for LF, SDNN, and MSSD. By contrast, there was no consistent pattern of associations among individuals without diabetes. At the population level, a lower HRV (reflective of impaired cardiac autonomic control) is statistically significantly related to the development of CHD among individuals with diabetes, independent of markers of the duration/severity of the glucose metabolism impairment. These data suggest a contribution of an impaired cardiac autonomic control to the risk of CHD among individuals with diabetes},

Within-subjects changes in these measures were assessed in 36 subjects during different postures and (paced) respiratory frequencies. Changes from supine to sitting to standing led to reduced RSA values and longer pre-ejection periods, reflecting the known decrease in vagal but not the increase of sympathetic activity. Multilevel path analysis showed that within-subjects changes in sympatho-vagal balance were faithfully reflected by changes in interbeat interval, but imperfectly by changes in RSA and pre-ejection period. It was concluded that pre-ejection period should be stratified for posture and RSA for respiratory frequency to reliably index changes in sympatho-vagal balance when these factors are prone to change (e.g., during 24-h ambulatory recording).},

abstract = {The objectives of this review are to discuss the diversity of mechanisms that may explain the association between heart rate (HR) variability and mortality, to appraise the clinical applicability of traditional and new measures of HR variability and to propose future directions in this field of research. There is a large body of data demonstrating that abnormal HR variability measured over a 24-h period provides information on the risk of subsequent death in subjects with and without structural heart disease. However, the mechanisms responsible for this association are not completely established. Therefore, no specific therapy is currently available to improve the prognosis for patients with abnormal HR variability. Reduced HR variability has been most commonly associated with a risk of arrhythmic death, but recent data suggest that abnormal variability also predicts vascular causes of death, progression of coronary atherosclerosis and death due to heart failure. A consensus is also lacking on the best HR variability measure for clinical purposes. Time and frequency domain measures of HR variability have been most commonly used, but recent studies show that new analysis methods based on nonlinear dynamics may be more powerful in terms of risk stratification. Before the measurement of HR variability can be applied to clinical practice and used to direct therapy, more precise insight into the pathophysiological link between HR variability and mortality are needed. Further studies should also address the issue of which of the HR variability indexes, including the new nonlinear measures, is best for clinical purposes in various patient populations.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate the ability of microvolt-level T-wave alternans (MTWA) to identify prospectively patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) at risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmic events and to compare its predictive accuracy with that of conventional risk stratifiers. BACKGROUND: Patients with DCM are at increased risk of sudden death from ventricular tachyarrhythmias. At present, there are no established methods of assessing this risk. METHODS: A total of 137 patients with DCM underwent risk stratification through assessment of MTWA, left ventricular ejection fraction, baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), heart rate variability, presence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), signal-averaged electrocardiogram, and presence of intraventricular conduction defect. The study end point was either sudden death, resuscitated ventricular fibrillation, or documented hemodynamically unstable VT. RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 14 ± 6 months, MTWA and BRS were significant univariate predictors of ventricular tachyarrhythmic events (p {\textless} 0.035 and p {\textless} 0.015, respectively). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that only MTWA was a significant predictor. CONCLUSIONS: Microvolt-level T-wave alternans is a powerful independent predictor of ventricular tachyarrhythmic events in patients with DCM. {\textcopyright} 2003 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {Sudden cardiac death occurs as a result of a complex interplay of changes in myocardial substrate, imbalance of autonomic regulation of the heart, and myocardial vulnerability. Noninvasive electrocardiology serves as a comprehensive tool for investigating factors representing mechanistic pathways leading to cardiac events. Heart rate variability, nonlinear dynamics of heart rate, and heart rate turbulence provide insight into autonomic control of the heart. Prognostic value of these parameters in postinfarction patients is well established for predicting cardiac death, but there is less evidence for their association with sudden death or arrhythmic events. Electrical manifestation of changes in myocardial substrate include QRS and QTc prolongation, presence of conduction disturbances, presence of late potentials, abnormalities of repolarization morphology, and presence of nonsinus rhythm, namely atrial fibrillation. Electrocardiogram (ECG) measures reflecting myocardial vulnerability to arrhythmias include frequent ventricular premature beats, T wave alternans, or QT variability. Prognostic significance of these parameters is documented in studies focused mostly on them as individual markers of risk. The noninvasive electrocardiology substudy of the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator implantation Trial II (MADIT II) allows for simultaneous analysis of several of the above ECG markers of risk and will provide insight about relative contribution of mechanistic pathways leading to cardiac death in postinfarction patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction. Combination of a standard 12-lead ECG and 10-minute high-resolution Holter recordings serves to evaluate the prognostic significance of noninvasive electrocardiology parameters for mortality in patients randomized to conventional treatment and for arrhythmic events in patients randomized to implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy.},

abstract = {Background: Both race and social class influence cardiovascular outcomes, through mechanisms not yet fully understood. Minority race and lower social class are sources of chronic stress, which can alter autonomic nervous system function. Heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function, is also an important predictor of cardiovascular outcomes. Methods: To determine whether minority race/ethnicity and lower social class are associated with depressed HRV, we prospectively collected data on sociodemographic, clinical, psychological, and behavioral factors by survey in 360 outpatients undergoing ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Heart rate variability (24-hour) was measured by frequency domain analysis. Results: In unadjusted analysis, African Americans had lower HRV than whites, and individuals of lower social class as measured by education, occupation, and income had lower HRV than those of higher class. In multivariable analysis, both race and social class were independent predictors of ultralow frequency power after controlling for clinical and psychological factors. African Americans were 3.45 (95{\%} CI 1.74-6.98, P = .0004) times as likely as whites to have depressed HRV (ultralow frequency power, lowest tertile), and non-college graduates 2.94 (95{\%} CI, 1.71-5.14, P = .0001) times as likely as college graduates to have depressed HRV. Conclusions: Heart rate variability is lower in African Americans and individuals of lower social class, independent of the effects of measured clinical, psychological, or behavioral factors. This suggests that the adverse effects of minority race and lower social class on cardiovascular outcomes may be mediated by dysregulation of autonomic function. {\textcopyright} 2005, Mosby, Inc.

This study examines the association between global DNA methylation and IR using 84 monozygotic twin pairs. IR was estimated using homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). Global DNA methylation of Alu repeats in peripheral blood leukocytes was quantified by bisulfite pyrosequencing. The association between global DNA methylation and IR was examined using generalized estimating equation (GEE) and within-twin pair analyses, adjusting for potential confounders. Results show that methylation levels at all four CpG sites were individually associated with IR by GEE (all false discovery rate-adjusted P values≤0.026). A 10{\%} increase in mean Alu methylation was associated with an increase of 4.55 units (95{\%} CI 2.38-6.73) in HOMA. Intrapair difference in IR was significantly associated with intrapair difference in global methylation level. A 10{\%} increase in the difference in mean Alu methylation was associated with an increase of 4.54 units (0.34-8.71; P=0.036) in the difference in HOMA. Confirmation of the results by intrapair analyses suggests that genetic factors do not confound the association between global DNA methylation and IR. Exclusion of twins taking diabetes medication (n=17) did not change our results.},

abstract = {Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors) reduce plasma cholesterol and improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation, inflammation and oxidative stress. A 'pleiotropic' property of statins receiving less attention is their effect on the autonomic nervous system. Increased central sympathetic outflow and diminished cardiac vagal tone are disturbances characteristic of a range of cardiovascular conditions for which statins are now prescribed routinely to reduce cardiovascular events: following myocardial infarction, and in hypertension, chronic kidney disease, heart failure and diabetes. The purpose of the present review is to synthesize contemporary evidence that statins can improve autonomic circulatory regulation. In experimental preparations, high-dose lipophilic statins have been shown to reduce adrenergic outflow by attenuating oxidative stress in central brain regions involved in sympathetic and parasympathetic discharge induction and modulation. In patients with hypertension, chronic kidney disease and heart failure, lipophilic statins, such as simvastatin or atorvastatin, have been shown to reduce MNSA (muscle sympathetic nerve activity) by 12–30 {\%}. Reports concerning the effect of statin therapy on HRV (heart rate variability) are less consistent. Because of their implications for BP (blood pressure) control, insulin sensitivity, arrhythmogenesis and sudden cardiac death, these autonomic nervous system actions should be considered additional mechanisms by which statins lower cardiovascular risk.},

We hypothesized that digital vasoconstrictions as measured by peripheral arterial tonometery (PAT), combined with an increase in pulse rate, would accurately reflect arousals from sleep, and can provide an autonomic arousal index (AAI). Based on a previously studied group of 40 sleep apnea patients simultaneously recorded by both polysomnography (PSG) and PAT systems, an automated algorithm using the PAT signal (and pulse rate derived from it) was developed for detection of arousals from sleep. This was further validated in a separate group of 96 subjects (85 patients referred with suspected obstructive sleep apnea and 11 healthy volunteers mean age 46.2+/-14.4 years, BMI 28.5+/-5.4 kg/m2). All underwent a whole night PSG with simultaneous PAT recording. The PSG recordings were blindly manually analyzed for arousals based on American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) criteria, while PAT was scored automatically. There was a significant correlation between PSG and PAT arousals (R=0.82, p{\textless}0.0001) with a good agreement across a wide range of values, with a ROC curve having an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88. We conclude that automated analysis of the peripheral arterial tonometry signal can detect EEG arousals from sleep, in a relatively quick and reproducible fashion.},

abstract = {Whether autonomic dysfunction predates the development of symptomatic heart failure (HF) or is simply a consequence of severe HF is unknown. We hypothesized that reduced heart rate variability (a marker of abnormal autonomic function) at baseline is associated with incident HF in subjects free of clinically recognized cardiovascular disease. In the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a population-based study of subclinical cardiovascular disease in adults aged 45 to 84 years, we measured the heart rate variability using a standard 30-second, 12-lead electrocardiogram to measure the standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences in RR intervals (RMSSD). During a median follow-up of 7.6 years, 95 participants developed HF (incidence rate 2.7/1,000 person-years). After adjusting for age, gender, and ethnicity, the hazard ratio for incident HF stratified by the RMSSD tertile was 2.4 (95{\%} confidence interval 1.4 to 4.2) for the lowest tertile and 1.7 (95{\%} confidence interval 1.0 to 3.2) for the middle tertile (highest tertile was the referent group; p for trend {\textless}0.001). The inverse association between the RMSSD and incident HF persisted after adjustment for additional covariates, including diabetes, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, subclinical atherosclerosis, left ventricular end-systolic volume, interim myocardial infarction, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (p for trend = 0.009). A similarly significant inverse association was also observed for SDNN. In conclusion, baseline autonomic dysfunction was a risk factor for the development of HF in a multiethnic cohort. These population-based findings implicate autonomic dysfunction in the pathogenesis of HF, and decreased short-term heart rate variability might be a novel form of stage B (asymptomatic) HF. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback is a self-regulation strategy used to improve conditions including asthma, stress, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Respiratory muscle function affects hemodynamic influences on respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and HRV and HRV-biofeedback protocols often include slow abdominal breathing to achieve physiologically optimal patterns of HRV with power spectral distribution concentrated around the 0.1-Hz frequency and large amplitude. It is likely that optimal balanced breathing patterns and ability to entrain heart rhythms to breathing reflect physiological efficiency and resilience and that individuals with dysfunctional breathing patterns may have difficulty voluntarily modulating HRV and RSA. The relationship between breathing movement patterns and HRV, however, has not been investigated. This study examines how individuals' habitual breathing patterns correspond with their ability to optimize HRV and RSA. METHOD: Breathing pattern was assessed using the Manual Assessment of Respiratory Motion (MARM) and the Hi Lo manual palpation techniques in 83 people with possible dysfunctional breathing before they attempted HRV biofeedback. Mean respiratory rate was also assessed. Subsequently, participants applied a brief 5-minute biofeedback protocol, involving breathing and positive emotional focus, to achieve HRV patterns proposed to reflect physiological "coherence" and entrainment of heart rhythm oscillations to other oscillating body systems. RESULTS: Thoracic-dominant breathing was associated with decreased coherence of HRV (r = -.463, P = .0001). Individuals with paradoxical breathing had the lowest HRV coherence (t(8) = 10.7, P = .001), and the negative relationship between coherence of HRV and extent of thoracic breathing was strongest in this group (r = -.768, P = .03). CONCLUSION: Dysfunctional breathing patterns are associated with decreased ability to achieve HRV patterns that reflect cardiorespiratory efficiency and autonomic nervous system balance. This suggests that dysfunctional breathing patterns are not only biomechanically inefficient but also reflect decreased physiological resilience. Breathing assessment using simple manual techniques such as the MARM and Hi Lo may be useful in HRV biofeedback to identify if poor responders require more emphasis on correction of dysfunctional breathing.},

abstract = {This study examined the effects on healthy adults of a new emotional self-management program, consisting of two key techniques, "Cut-Thru" and the "Heart Lock-In." These techniques are designed to eliminate negative thought loops and promote sustained positive emotional states. The hypotheses were that training and practice in these techniques would yield lowered levels of stress and negative emotion and cortisol, while resulting in increased positive emotion and DHEA levels over a one-month period. In addition, we hypothesized that increased coherence in heart rate variability patterns would be observed during the practice of the techniques. Forty-five healthy adults participated in the study, fifteen of whom acted as a comparison group for the psychological measures. Salivary DHEA/DHEAS and cortisol levels were measured, autonomic nervous system function was assessed by heart rate variability analysis, and emotions were measured using a psychological questionnaire. Individuals in the experimental group were assessed before and four weeks after receiving training in the self-management techniques. The experimental group experienced significant increases in the positive affect scales of Caring and Vigor and significant decreases in the negative affect scales of Guilt, Hostility, Burnout, Anxiety and Stress Effects, while no significant changes were seen in the comparison group. There was a mean 23 percent reduction in cortisol and a 100 percent increase in DHEA/DHEAS in the experimental group. DHEA was significantly and positively related to the affective state Warmheartedness, whereas cortisol was significantly and positively related to Stress Effects. Increased coherence in heart rate variability patterns was measured in 80 percent of the experimental group during the use of the techniques. The results suggest that techniques designed to eliminate negative thought loops can have important positive effects on stress, emotions and key physiological systems. The implications are that relatively inexpensive interventions may dramatically and positively impact individuals' health and well-being. Thus, individuals may have greater control over their minds, bodies and health than previously suspected.},

We will emphasize the relationship between attentional regulation and affective processes and propose a group of underlying physiological systems that serve to integrate these functions in the service of self-regulation and adaptability of the organism. We will attempt to place this network in the context of dynamical systems models which involve feedback and feedforward circuits with special attention to negative feedback mechanisms, inhibitory processes, and their role in response selection. From a systems perspective, inhibitory processes can be viewed as negative feedback circuits that allow for the interruption of ongoing behavior and the re-deployment of resources to other tasks. When these negative feedback mechanisms are compromised, positive feedback loops may develop as a result (of dis-inhibition). From this perspective, the relative sympathetic activation seen in anxiety disorders may represent dis-inhibition due to faulty inhibitory mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

BACKGROUND: Previous studies describing the use of MTWA as a predictor of ventricular tachyarrhythmic events have been limited by small sample sizes and disparate populations. METHODS: Prospective studies of the predictive value of exercise-induced MTWA published between January 1990 and December 2004 were retrieved. Data from each article were abstracted independently by two authors using a standardized protocol. Summary estimates of the predictive value of MTWA were made using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Data were accumulated from 19 studies (2,608 subjects) across a wide range of populations. Overall, the positive predictive value of MTWA for arrhythmic events was 19.3{\%} at an average of 21 months' follow-up (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 17.7{\%} to 21.0{\%}), the negative predictive value was 97.2{\%} (95{\%} CI 96.5{\%} to 97.9{\%}), and the univariate relative risk of an arrhythmic event was 3.77 (95{\%} CI 2.39 to 5.95). There was no difference in predictive value between ischemic and nonischemic heart failure subgroups. The positive predictive value varied depending on the population of patients studied (p {\textless} 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Microvolt T-wave alternans testing has significant value for the prediction of ventricular tachyarrhythmic events; however, there are significant limitations to its use. The predictive value of MTWA varies significantly depending on the population studied. Careful standardization is needed for what constitutes abnormal MTWA. The incremental prognostic value of MTWA when used with other methods of risk stratification is unclear. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {Background: Recent studies have shown that depressive disorder is associated with impaired baroreceptor or baroreflex sensitivity, which is proposed to be a predisposing factor for sudden death in patients with manifest cardiac disease. These studies have not evaluated the afferent and efferent components of the cardiac baroreflex loop or other baroreflex mechanisms that regulate target processes (cardiac metabolism and blood pressure variability) related to the impairment. The objective of this study was to gain more insight into autonomic functioning in depressive disorder to more fully examine the potential basis for increased cardiac mortality. Methods: The subjects were 28 women and men with unipolar major depression who were taking antidepressant medications and who were in partial remission and free of cardiovascular or other serious disease, and 28 healthy control subjects matched for sex, age, and ethnicity. The two samples were compared for negative affective dispositions (anger expression, hostility, defensiveness, anxiety), spontaneous (closed-loop) baroreflex activity, heart rate, heart rate variability, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate-systolic blood pressure double product under resting conditions. Results: Depressed patients showed a general disposition to anger suppression coupled with higher hostility and anxiety, and lower defensiveness. The patients showed higher general sympathetic activity (high levels of blood pressure, low-frequency heart rate variability) and lower parasympathetic-related activity (high heart rate and reduced high frequency heart rate variability) with affected cardiac metabolism estimated by the double product. Depressed patients had lower baroreflex sensitivity related to a higher gain of the afferent component of the baroreflex without respective gain adjustment of its efferent component (reflex gain 'de-afferentation'). It was coupled with a compensatory higher number of effective baroreflex reactions (reflex gating 're-afferentation'). Antidepressant agents and depressed mood had additional independent effects on baroreflex sensitivity through the efferent component of the cardiac baroreflex loop. Conclusions: The data indicate that different baroreflex components and mechanisms may be impaired in patients with depression and may contribute to their increased cardiac risk. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heritable electrocardiographic (ECG) and heart rate variability (HRV) measures, reflecting pacemaking, conduction, repolarization and autonomic function in the heart have been associated with risks for cardiac arrhythmias. Whereas several rare monogenic conditions with extreme phenotypes have been noted, few common genetic factors contributing to interindividual variability in ECG and HRV measures have been identified. We report the results of a community-based genomewide association study of six ECG and HRV intermediate traits.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Genotyping using Affymetrix 100K GeneChip was conducted on 1345 related Framingham Heart Study Original and Offspring cohort participants. We analyzed 1175 Original and Offspring participants with ECG data (mean age 52 years, 52{\%} women) and 548 Offspring participants with HRV data (mean age 48 years, 51{\%} women), in relation to 70,987 SNPs with minor allele frequency {\textgreater} or = 0.10, call rate {\textgreater} or = 80{\%}, Hardy-Weinberg p-value {\textgreater} or = 0.001. We used generalized estimating equations to test association of SNP alleles with multivariable-adjusted residuals for QT, RR, and PR intervals, the ratio of low frequency to high frequency power (LF/HFP), total power (TP) and the standard deviation of normal RR intervals (SDNN).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Associations at p {\textless} 10(-3) were found for 117 (QT), 105 (RR), 111 (PR), 102 (LF/HF), 121 (TP), and 102 (SDNN) SNPs. Several common variants in NOS1AP (4 SNPs with p-values {\textless} 10(-3); lowest p-value, rs6683968, p = 1 x 10(-4)) were associated with adjusted QT residuals, consistent with our previously reported finding for NOS1AP in an unrelated sample of FHS Offspring and other cohorts. All results are publicly available at NCBI's dbGaP at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007 webcite.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: In the community-based Framingham Heart Study none of the ECG and HRV results individually attained genomewide significance. However, the presence of bona fide QT-associated SNPs among the top 117 results for QT duration supports the importance of efforts to validate top results from the reported scans. Finding genetic variants associated with ECG and HRV quantitative traits may identify novel genes and pathways implicated in arrhythmogenesis and allow for improved recognition of individuals at high risk for arrhythmias in the general population.},

abstract = {Objectives The study objectives were to create a cardiac metaiodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) database using multiple prospective cohort studies and to determine the quantitative iodine-123-labeled mIBG indices for identifying patients with chronic heart failure (HF) at greatest and lowest risk of lethal events. Background Although the prognostic value of cardiac mIBG imaging in patients with HF has been shown, clinical use of this procedure has been limited. It is required to define universally accepted quantitative thresholds for high and low risk that could be used as an aid to therapeutic decision-making using a large cohort database. Methods Six prospective HF cohort studies were updated, and the individual datasets were combined for the present patient-level analysis. The database consisted of 1,322 patients with HF followed up for a mean interval of 78 months. Heart-to-mediastinum ratio (HMR) and washout rate of cardiac mIBG activity were the primary cardiac innervation markers. The primary outcome analyzed was all-cause death. Results Lethal events were observed in 326 patients, and the population mortality rate was 5.6{\%}, 11.3{\%}, and 19.7{\%} at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard model analysis for all-cause mortality identified age (p {\textless} 0.0001), New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class (p {\textless} 0.0001), late HMR of cardiac mIBG activity (p {\textless} 0.0001), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (p = 0.0029) as significant independent predictors. Analysis of the 512-patient subpopulation with B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) results showed BNP (p {\textless} 0.0001), greater NYHA functional class (p = 0.0002), and late HMR (p = 0.0011) as significant predictors, but LVEF was not. The receiver-operating characteristic-determined threshold of HMR (1.68) identified patients at significantly increased risk in any LVEF category. Survival rates decreased progressively with decreasing HMR, with 5-year all-cause mortality rates {\textgreater}7{\%} annually for HMR {\textless}1.25, and {\textless}2{\%} annually for HMR ≥1.95. Addition of HMR to clinical information resulted in a significant net reclassification improvement of 0.175 (p {\textless} 0.0001). Conclusions Pooled analyses of independent cohort studies confirmed the long-term prognostic value of cardiac mIBG uptake in patients with HF independently of other markers, such as NYHA functional class, BNP, and LVEF, and demonstrated that categoric assessments could be used to define meaningful thresholds for lethal event risk. {\textcopyright} 2013 by The American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

Dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) may explain why depressed patients are at increased risk. Studies of medically well, depressed psychiatric patients have found elevated levels of plasma catecholamines and other markers of altered ANS function compared with controls. Studies of depressed patients with CHD have also uncovered evidence of ANS dysfunction, including elevated heart rate, low heart rate variability, exaggerated heart rate responses to physical stressors, high variability in ventricular repolarization, and low baroreceptor sensitivity. All of these indicators of ANS dysfunction have been associated with increased risks of mortality and cardiac morbidity in patients with CHD. Further research is needed to determine whether ANS dysfunction mediates the effects of depression on the course and outcome of CHD, and to develop clinical interventions that improve cardiovascular autonomic regulation while relieving depression in patients with CHD.},

abstract = {A cornerstone for research into the link between stress and health has been the reactivity hypothesis; cardiovascular reactivity to psychological stressors, if prolonged or exaggerated, can promote the development of cardiovascular disease. However, it has recently been argued that low or blunted reactivity is also associated with negative health outcomes. As such, in this special issue we present further evidence implicating that cardiovascular and stress hormone responses to acute stress at the other end of the response spectrum can also be considered a pathway to ill health. In this introductory article, we explore and review the origins of and potential mechanisms underlying blunted responses to acute stress. In so doing, we aim to highlight: what is currently known regarding this new conceptualization of the reactivity hypothesis; the potential explanations for blunted reactivity; the pathways underlying associations with health outcomes; and where this field is headed in terms of developing our understanding of the link between reactivity and health. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The methods used to assess cardiac parasympathetic (cardiovagal) activity and its effects on the heart in both humans and animal models are reviewed. Heart rate (HR)-based methods include measurements of the HR response to blockade of muscarinic cholinergic receptors (parasympathetic tone), beat-to-beat HR variability (HRV) (parasympathetic modulation), rate of post-exercise HR recovery (parasympathetic reactivation), and reflex-mediated changes in HR evoked by activation or inhibition of sensory (afferent) nerves. Sources of excitatory afferent input that increase cardiovagal activity and decrease HR include baroreceptors, chemoreceptors, trigeminal receptors, and subsets of cardiopulmonary receptors with vagal afferents. Sources of inhibitory afferent input include pulmonary stretch receptors with vagal afferents and subsets of visceral and somatic receptors with spinal afferents. The different methods used to assess cardiovagal control of the heart engage different mechanisms, and therefore provide unique and complementary insights into underlying physiology and pathophysiology. In addition, techniques for direct recording of cardiovagal nerve activity in animals; the use of decerebrate and in vitro preparations that avoid confounding effects of anesthesia; cardiovagal control of cardiac conduction, contractility, and refractoriness; and noncholinergic mechanisms are described. Advantages and limitations of the various methods are addressed, and future directions are proposed.},

abstract = {The diagnosis of autonomic neuropathy frequently depends on results of tests which elicit reflex changes in heart rate. Few well-documented normal ranges are available for these tests. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of age upon heart rate variability at rest and in response to a single deep breath, the Valsalva manoeuvre, and standing. A computerised method of measurement of R-R interval variation was used to study heart rate responses in 310 healthy subjects aged 18-85 years. Heart rate variation during each procedure showed a skewed distribution and a statistically significant negative correlation with age. Normal ranges (90{\%} and 95{\%} confidence limits) for subjects aged 20-75 years were calculated for heart rate difference (max-min) and ratio (max/min) and standard deviation (SD). Heart rate responses were less than the 95th centile in at least one of the four procedures in 39 (12.6{\%}) out of the 310 subjects, and were below this limit in two or more tests in five (1.6{\%}) subjects. In view of the decline in heart rate variation with increasing age, normal ranges for tests of autonomic function must be related to the age of the subject.},

abstract = {Recent investigations using direct (microneurographic) recordings of MSNA have provided a substantial amount of new information on the regulation of sympathetic nervous system control of nonactive skeletal muscle blood flow during exercise in humans. Some of the new conclusions from these studies discussed in this review include: 1. The direction, pattern and magnitude of the MSNA response to exercise depend on the collective influence of a number of factors, including the mode (isometric or rhythmic), intensity, and duration of the exercise, the size of the contracting muscle mass, and possibly the level of conditioning (physical training) of the exercising muscles. The MSNA response also appears to be tightly coupled with the onset and progression of muscle fatigue, at least during sustained, isometric contractions. 2. Increases in MSNA evoked during exercise with the arms are fairly uniform among different skeletal muscle nerves, and these responses correlate strongly with changes in venous plasma norepinephrine concentrations, limb vascular resistance and arterial blood pressure. Thus, increases in this neural activity during exercise are associated with the expected physiological responses. 3. The MSNA response to the same level of exercise varies markedly among healthy subjects but appears to be consistent over time within a particular subject. 4. The muscle metaboreflex (muscle chemoreflex) is the primary-mechanism by which MSNA is stimulated during small-muscle, isometric exercise in humans. In contrast, central command has a relatively weak influence on MSNA during this type of exercise. 5. Muscle metaboreflex-stimulation of MSNA also occurs during dynamic exercise, but only at or above moderate, submaximal intensities (i.e., not during mild exercise). 6. Muscle metaboreflex-evoked increases in MSNA during exercise are strongly associated with glycogenolysis and the consequent cellular accumulation of hydrogen ions in the contracting muscles. 7. Sympathoinhibitory cardiopulmonary reflexes do not appear to modulate the MSNA responses to isometric exercise in the healthy human. However, arterial baroreflexes exert a potent inhibitory effect on MSNA during this form of exercise. The mechanisms involved in the regulation of MSNA during large-muscle, dynamic leg exercise is an important topic for future investigations, as is the relationship between MSNA and sympathetic outflow to other regional circulations (e.g., heart, viscera, skin) during various forms of exercise.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Depression is a risk factor for mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), possibly as a result of altered autonomic nervous system (ANS) modulation of heart rate (HR) and rhythm. The purposes of this study were to determine: a) whether depressed patients are more likely to have an abnormal HR response (i.e., abnormal turbulence) to premature ventricular contractions (VPCs), and b) whether abnormal HR turbulence accounts for the effect of depression on increased mortality after AMI. METHODS Ambulatory electrocardiographic data were obtained from 666 (316 depressed, 350 nondepressed) patients with a recent AMI; 498 had VPCs with measurable HR turbulence. Of these, 260 had normal, 152 had equivocal, and 86 had abnormal HR turbulence. Patients were followed for up to 30 (median = 24) months. RESULTS Depressed patients were more likely to have abnormal HR turbulence (risk factor adjusted odds ratio = 1.8; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.0-3.0; p = .03) and have worse survival (odds ratio = 2.4; 95{\%} CI = 1.2-4.6; p = .02) than nondepressed patients. When HR turbulence was added to the model, the adjusted hazard ratio for depression decreased to 1.9 (95{\%} CI = 0.9-3.8; p = .08), and to 1.6 (95{\%} CI = 0.8-3.4; p = .18) when a measure of HR variability (LnVLF) was added. The hazard was found to differ over time with depression posing little risk for mortality in year 1 but greater risk in years 2 and 3 of the follow up. CONCLUSION ANS dysregulation may partially mediate the increased risk for mortality in depressed patients with frequent VPCs after an AMI.},

abstract = {AIM: This research was designed to study the temporal changes in cardiovascular autonomic regulation, assessed by 24-hour heart rate (HR) variability, and the possible relation of changes in HR variability to cardiovascular risk factors and progression of coronary artery disease (CAD) among type II diabetic subjects. METHOD: In a single-center substudy of The Diabetes Atherosclerosis Intervention Study (DAIS), 53 patients assigned to fenofibrate (n = 26) or placebo (n = 27), underwent time and frequency domain and fractal analysis of HR variability, coronary risk variable analyses and quantitative coronary angiograms at baseline and after three years' follow-up. RESULTS: Twenty-four hour standard deviation of sinus intervals (SDNN) decreased from 113 +/- 35 to 94 +/- 30 msec (P {\textless} 0.001) during the three year period. Low frequency power spectral component and short-term fractal scaling exponent also decreased (P {\textless} 0.001 and P {\textless} 0.05, respectively). The reduction of SDNN was weakly related to a change in the triglyceride level (r = -0.33, P {\textless} 0.05), glucose level (r = -0.28, P {\textless} 0.05) and total cholesterol concentration (r = -0.35, P {\textless} 0.01). Furthermore, the reduction of SDNN was related to a decrease in the minimum lumen and mean segment diameter of the coronary arteries (r = 0.36, P {\textless} 0.01, and r = 0.39, P {\textless} 0.01, respectively). This association was more marked in the placebo group (r = 0.50, P {\textless} 0.01 and r = 0.44, P {\textless} 0.05, respectively) than among the patients randomized to fenofibrate (not significant for both). CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular autonomic regulation assessed by HR variability deteriorates rapidly in type II diabetic subjects with CAD during the time course. Impairment in HR variability is associated with changes in common coronary risk variables and with a progression of CAD.},

In the animal with acute myocardial ischemia such stimuli suffice to provoke ventricular fibrillation. Vagal neural traffic or adrenal catecholamines are not the conduits for this brain-heart linkage. Accompanying increases in heart rate or blood pressure are not prerequisites for the changes in cardiac excitability. Increased sympathetic activity, whether induced by neural or neurohumoral action, predisposes the heart to ventricular fibrillation. Protection can be achieved with surgical and pharmacologic denervation or reflex reduction in sympathetic tone. With acute myocardial ischemia, augmented sympathetic activity accounts for the early surge of ectopic activity frequently precipitating ventricular fibrillation. Asymmetries in sympathetic neural discharge may also contribute to the genesis of serious arrhythmias. The vagus nerve, through its muscarinic action, exerts an indirect effect on cardiac vulnerability, the consequence of annulment of concomitant adrenergic influence, rather than of any direct cholinergic action on the ventricles. There exist anatomic, physiologic as well as molecular bases for such interactions. Available experimental evidence indicates that environmental stresses of diverse types can injure the heart, lower the threshold of cardiac vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation and, in the animal with coronary occlusion, provoke potentially malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Available evidence indicates that in man, as in the experimental animal, administration of catecholamines can induce ventricular arrhythmia, whereas vagal activity exerts an opposite effect. Furthermore, in certain subjects diverse stresses and various psychologic states provoke ventricular ectopic activity. {\textcopyright} 1977 Dun {\textperiodcentered} Donnelley Publishing Corporation 666 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10019 All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Unmanaged emotional reactions to stress not only lead to behavior problems in young people but also create physiological conditions that inhibit learning and potentially increase the risk of disease later in life. For these reasons, the integration of emotional self-management skills training programs has become an increased priority in some schools. In this study, middle school students enrolled in a course in emotional competence skills learned techniques designed to intercept stressful responses during emotionally challenging situations. Behavioral outcomes were assessed using the Achievement Inventory Measure and autonomic function was measured by heart rate variability (HRV) analysis during and after a stressful interview. Following the program, students exhibited significant improvements in areas including stress and anger management, risky behavior, work management and focus, and relationships with family, peers and teachers. These improvements were sustained over the following six months. Students using the skills taught in the course to recover from acute emotional stress were also able to positively modulate their physiological stress responses. As compared to a control group, trained students demonstrated significantly increased HRV and more rhythmic, sine wave-like heart rhythm patterns during recovery. This response pattern reflects increased parasympathetic activity, heart rhythm coherence, and entrainment of other biological oscillatory systems to the primary heart rhythm frequency. Increased physiological coherence is associated with improved cognitive performance, emotional balance, mental clarity and health outcomes. These physiological shifts could promote the sustained psychological and behavioral improvements associated with the use of emotional management skills. It is suggested that learning emotional competence skills in childhood establishes healthier physiological response patterns which can benefit learning and long-term health. Results provide support for the integration in school curricula of courses designed to teach effective self-management skills to children.},

abstract = {To study the role of the sympathetic nervous system in the induction of inflammatory cytokines elicited by central lipopolysaccharide, sympathetic chemical denervation was performed by intraperitoneal injection of 6- hydroxydopamine. Rats received the neurotoxin according to the following schedule: 50 mg/kg on days 1 and 2, 100 mg/kg on days 3, 4 and 7. On day 8, lipopolysaccharide (2.5 $\mu$g/6 $\mu$l/rat) was injected intracerebroventricularly and rats were killed 2 h later. 6-Hydroxydopamine reduced noradrenaline and dopamine content in the spleen by 88.7{\%} and 88.8{\%}, respectively, without affecting striatal contents indicating that the chemical sympathectomy had been effective and selective. In sympathectomized rats, lipopolysaccharide raised interleukin-1$\beta$ and interleukin-6 serum levels more than in control rats given the vehicle. Tumour necrosis factor-$\alpha$ serum levels in sympathectomized rats were no different from those in vehicle-treated rats. Interleukin-1$\beta$ and interleukin-6 messenger RNA expression, measured by northern blot analysis, was clearly detectable in adrenals and spleen of rats given lipopolysaccharide. Sympathectomy increased lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-1$\beta$ and interleukin-6 messenger RNA in adrenals and spleen. Corticosterone basal levels were raised by central lipopolysaccharide and not further changed by sympathectomy. The present study shows that sympathetic nervous system denervation enhances the synthesis and production of peripheral interleukin-1$\beta$ and interleukin-6 in rats given central lipopolysaccharide and suggests a tonic inhibitory control of the sympathetic nervous system on these inflammatory cytokines.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether interindividual variation in parasympathetic (cholinergic) and sympathetic (adrenergic) regulation of heart rate (as estimated by frequency components of heart rate variability [HRV]) may be accounted for, in part, by genetic variation in the choline transporter, a component of acetylcholine neurotransmission. METHODS: Resting HRV estimates of high- (HF) and low-frequency (LF) power and LF/HF ratio were determined from electrocardiogram recordings collected continuously over 5 minutes in 413 white individuals of European ancestry (49{\{}{\%}{\}} men; aged 30-54 years [mean, 44 years]). Subjects were genotyped for a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the 3' untranslated region of the choline transporter gene (CHT1). Frequencies of the alternate CHT1 alleles, labeled G and T, were 76{\{}{\%}{\}} and 24{\{}{\%}{\}}. RESULTS: Compared with GG homozygotes, participants having any T allele had greater HF power (p {\{}{\textless}{\}}.02), lower LF power (p {\{}{\textless}{\}}.02), and lower LF/HF ratios (p {\{}{\textless}{\}}.005). Relative to men, women had lower LF power (p {\{}{\textless}{\}}.001) and lower LF/HF ratios (p {\{}{\textless}{\}}.005). CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that polymorphic variation in the CHT1 gene is associated significantly with interindividual variability in HRV indices related to parasympathetic (cholinergic) activity.},

abstract = {Background Noradrenergic function has been linked to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and might have a role in mediating sleep disturbances of the disorder. Our objective was to relate a peripheral manifestation of noradrenergic function, sympathetic nervous system activity as indexed by heart rate variability during sleep, to the development of PTSD in subjects with recent traumatic injuries. Methods Subjects who had recall of life-threatening experiences were recruited from one of two regional trauma centers. Select subjects received a polysomnographic recording within 1 month of the trauma. Digitized electrocardiogram recordings were extracted from early and late rapid-eye-movement (REM) and preceding non-REM sleep periods. Autoregression was applied to R-R interval time series to calculate the ratios of low-frequency to high-frequency spectral densities (LF/HF ratios), which index sympathetic activation. Posttraumatic stress disorder status was determined at 2 months. Results There was a significant state × group interaction: LF/HF ratios were higher during the REM sleep of the nine subjects who were positive for PTSD symptoms, compared with the 10 subjects who were PTSD negative. Conclusions Our findings are consistent with the possibility that increased noradrenergic activity during REM sleep contributes to the development of PTSD.},

It allows the assessment of system dynamics despite phase resetting and noise and in relation with either increases or decreases of the considered signal. We employ the method to study the quasi-periodicities of the human heart rate based on long-term ECG recordings. The center deflection of the PRSA curve characterizes the average capacity of the heart to decelerate (or accelerate) the cardiac rhythm. It can be measured by a central wavelet coefficient which we denote as deceleration capacity (DC). We find that decreased DC is a more precise predictor of mortality in survivors of heart attack than left ventricular ejection fraction, the current "gold standard" risk predictor. In addition, we discuss the dependence of the DC parameter on age and on diabetes.},

abstract = {Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) has been used as an index of parasympathetic cardiac control. However, recent psychophysiological research casts serious doubts upon the usefulness of RSA as an index of vagal influences upon the heart in psychophysiological as well as in clinical studies. It suggests the need to look for another measure. In this exploratory study we investigated whether the baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) could serve as an alternative tool to investigate between-subject tonic parasympathetic influences on the heart. In nine healthy subjects we examined the effects of intravenous atropine (0.03 mg/kg i.v.), intravenous metoprolol (10-15 mg i.v.), and of saline as a placebo condition upon RSA, BRS, and related cardiovascular and respiratory variables, both under resting and under mental task conditions. After parasympathetic blockade, RSA and BRS display values near zero, showing their vagal origin. After beta-adrenergic blockade, when heart period is predominantly under vagal control, RSA fails to predict heart period variability. Using BRS, however, it is possible to predict more than 97{\%} of heart period variance during beta-blockade. Finally, both the vagal and beta-adrenergic blockade show that BRS is a better predictor of parasympathetic cardiac control during blood pressure increases than during blood pressure decreases.},

abstract = {Objective: Evidence of elevated basal heart rate (HR) in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been interpreted in terms of elevated sympathetic cardiac activity, as have possible increased cardiovascular disease risks and outcomes associated with elevated HR. Yet it is well-established that the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system not only influences HR independently of the sympathetic branch, but makes a greater contribution to HR, including resting HR. Additionally, abnormally low tonic parasympathetic activity on the heart has been implicated in cardiovascular disease and hypertension. This study addressed a potential parasympathetic contribution to elevated basal HR in PTSD. Methods: We used a descriptive and subgroup differences approach to investigate relationships between parasympathetic activity and basal HR in 59 adults (50 females) with PTSD, all of whom were participants in a treatment outcome study and assessed prior to exposure to trauma-related script-driven imagery. Consistent with the well-known relationship between parasympathetic activity and HR, we hypothesized that basal respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a measure of parasympathetic cardiac activity, would be negatively correlated with basal HR. More important, we predicted that pathologically elevated HRs previously associated with PTSD would only characterize a low-RSA subgroup. Potential confounds of age, respiration rate, and aerobic fitness were addressed. Results: As predicted, mean HR was 80.5 bpm in the low-RSA tercile group, similar to mean HRs of PTSD groups in prior research and significantly higher than 69 and 65 bpm in the middle- and high-RSA groups, respectively, which are typical of non-PTSD controls. Conclusion: These findings suggest that a substantial proportion of those with PTSD may not have elevated basal HRs. Furthermore, among those who do exhibit elevated HR, there may be a parasympathetic contribution that is independent of any sympathetic one. Only measuring both branches at once, ideally with autonomic blockades, can definitively address these issues. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence exists linking major depressive disorder (MDD) with clinical cardiovascular events. The importance of the sympathetic nervous system in the generation of cardiac risk in other contexts is established. OBJECTIVE: To examine the importance of the sympathetic nervous system in the generation of cardiac risk in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS: Studies were performed in 39 patients meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV) criteria for MDD and in 76 healthy subjects. Treatment for patients consisted of selective serotonin reuptake inhibition (SSRI) for 12 weeks. Whole body and cardiac sympathetic activity were examined using noradrenaline isotope dilution methodology and sympathetic nerve recording techniques. Measurement of the extraction of infused tritiated noradrenaline by the heart, and estimation of cardiac dihydroxyphenylglycol production provided direct quantification of neuronal noradrenaline reuptake. RESULTS: Sympathetic activity, particularly in the heart and for the whole body, in patients with MDD followed a bimodal distribution. Elevated values were observed in patients with co-morbid panic disorder (P = 0.006). Consistent with a defect in noradrenaline reuptake, the cardiac extraction of tritiated noradrenaline (0.80 +/- 0.01 versus 0.56 +/- 0.04{\%}, P {\textless} 0.001) and cardiac dihydroxyphenylglycol overflow (109 +/- 8 versus 73 +/- 11, P = 0.01) were reduced in patients with MDD. SSRI therapy abolished the excessive sympathetic activation, with whole body noradrenaline spillover falling from 518 +/- 83 to 290 +/- 41 ng/min (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a subset of patients with MDD in whom sympathetic nervous activity is extraordinarily high, including in the sympathetic outflow to the heart. Treatment with an SSRI may reduce sympathetic activity in a manner likely to reduce cardiac risk.},

PSA of HRV is a noninvasive technique, based on ECG sampling of RR interval variation, thus providing a dynamic assessment of sympathetic and parasympathetic tone, reflecting the interactions between the two. It has been shown to have potential value in various laboratory and clinical conditions. It is influenced by many factors such as age, sex, position, breathing, smoking, hour of the day and medications. Different methods of data processing by various authors have often elicited conflicting results. Standard values are not yet available to be used or compared in different settings. From the interest it has raised, it may be expected that this method will be in widespread use in clinical practice in the future, providing a useful tool, both for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, as well as serving as a further aid towards monitoring therapeutic interventions. This review highlights techniques of dynamic assessment of HRV and studies of its clinical applications in psychiatry in particular. It raises the potentially important prognostic implications of protracted autonomic dysfunction in psychiatric patient populations, especially for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.},

abstract = {Background: Spectral analysis of heart rate variability has recently been shown to be a reliable noninvasive test for quantitative assessment of cardiovascular autonomic regulatory responses, providing a dynamic map of sympathetic and parasympathetic interaction. In a prior study exploring the state of hyperarousal characterizing the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) syndrome, the authors described standardized heart rate analysis carried out in 9 PTSD patients at rest, which demonstrated clear-cut evidence of a baseline autonomic hyperarousal state. Methods: To examine the dynamics of this hyperarousal state, standardized heart rate analysis was carried out in 9 PTSD patients compared to a matched control group of 9 healthy volunteers. Twenty-minute recordings of electrocardiogram in response to a trauma- related cue as opposed to a resting state were performed and analyzed. The PTSD patients were asked to recount the presumed triggering traumatic event, and the control subjects recounted a significant stressful negative life event. Results: Our results show that, whereas the control subjects demonstrated significant autonomic responses to the stressogenic stimulus supplied by the recounting of a major stressful experience, the PTSD patients demonstrated almost no autonomic response to the recounting of the triggering stressful event. The PTSD patients demonstrated a degree of autonomic dysregulation at rest which was comparable to that seen in the control subjects' reaction to the stress model. Conclusions: The lack of response to the stress model applied in the study appears to imply that PTSD patients experience so great a degree of autonomic hyperactivation at rest, that they are unable to marshal a further stress response to the recounting of the triggering trauma, as compared to control subjects.},

abstract = {A method of determining baroreceptor reflex sensitivity is proposed that is based on spectral analysis of systolic pressure values and RR interval times, namely, the modulus (or gain) in the mid frequency band (0.07-0.14 Hz) between these two signals. Results using this method were highly correlated (0.94; n = 8) with results of the phenylephrine method. In addition, compared with the values for the preceding rest period, the modulus decreased during mental challenge, as might be expected from the literature.

The ensuing rise in blood pressure causes a baroreceptor-mediated slowing of heart rate. The successive systolic pressure values are correlated with the length of the next RR interval. The regression coefficient of the correlation diagram gives the BRS in milliseconds of interval prolongation per millimeter of mercury pressure rise (Figure 1). Variability of blood pressure and RR interval time can be expressed by its standard deviation. However, this measure does not give any information about the source of the fluctuations.

abstract = {To study the role of the sympathetic nervous system in the induction of inflammatory cytokines elicited by central lipopolysaccharide, sympathetic chemical denervation was performed by intraperitoneal injection of 6- hydroxydopamine. Rats received the neurotoxin according to the following schedule: 50 mg/kg on days 1 and 2, 100 mg/kg on days 3, 4 and 7. On day 8, lipopolysaccharide (2.5 $\mu$g/6 $\mu$l/rat) was injected intracerebroventricularly and rats were killed 2 h later. 6-Hydroxydopamine reduced noradrenaline and dopamine content in the spleen by 88.7{\%} and 88.8{\%}, respectively, without affecting striatal contents indicating that the chemical sympathectomy had been effective and selective. In sympathectomized rats, lipopolysaccharide raised interleukin-1$\beta$ and interleukin-6 serum levels more than in control rats given the vehicle. Tumour necrosis factor-$\alpha$ serum levels in sympathectomized rats were no different from those in vehicle-treated rats. Interleukin-1$\beta$ and interleukin-6 messenger RNA expression, measured by northern blot analysis, was clearly detectable in adrenals and spleen of rats given lipopolysaccharide. Sympathectomy increased lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-1$\beta$ and interleukin-6 messenger RNA in adrenals and spleen. Corticosterone basal levels were raised by central lipopolysaccharide and not further changed by sympathectomy. The present study shows that sympathetic nervous system denervation enhances the synthesis and production of peripheral interleukin-1$\beta$ and interleukin-6 in rats given central lipopolysaccharide and suggests a tonic inhibitory control of the sympathetic nervous system on these inflammatory cytokines.},

abstract = {Chronic imbalance of the autonomic nervous system is a prevalent and potent risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events, including mortality. Although not widely recognized by clinicians, this risk factor is easily assessed by measures such as resting and peak exercise heart rate, heart rate recovery after exercise, and heart rate variability. Any factor that leads to inappropriate activation of the sympathetic nervous system can be expected to have an adverse effect on these measures and thus on patient outcomes, while any factor that augments vagal tone tends to improve outcomes. Insulin resistance, sympathomimetic medications, and negative psychosocial factors all have the potential to affect autonomic function adversely and thus cardiovascular prognosis. Congestive heart failure and hypertension also provide important lessons about the adverse effects of sympathetic predominance, as well as illustrate the benefits of $\beta$-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 2 classes of drugs that reduce adrenergic tone. Other interventions, such as exercise, improve cardiovascular outcomes partially by increasing vagal activity and attenuating sympathetic hyperactivity.},

Previous studies have also not controlled for familial and genetic influences.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We performed power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory ECGs in 416 middle-aged male twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Memory and learning were measured by verbal and visual Selective Reminding Tests (SRTs). Mixed-effect regression models were used to calculate associations between and within twin pairs, while adjusting for covariates.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The mean age (standard deviation) was 55 (2.9) years. A statistically significant positive association was found between measures of HRV and verbal, but not visual, SRT scores. The most statistically significant unadjusted association was found between very low frequency HRV and verbal total recall SRT, such that each logarithm of increase in very low frequency was associated with an increased verbal SRT score of 4.85 points (p = .002). The association persisted despite the adjustment for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors, and after accounting for familial and genetic factors by comparing twins within pairs. A significant interaction was found between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and HRV, such that total power and ultra low frequency were associated with SRT in twins (n = 362) without PTSD, but not in those with PTSD.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Lower frequency spectra of HRV are associated with verbal, but not visual, learning and memory, particularly in subjects without PTSD. This association may indicate that autonomic nervous system dysregulation plays a role in cognitive decline.},

Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) has been suggested as a possible explanation for this association. The purpose of this study was to determine if depression is associated with reduced HRV in patients with a recent MI. METHODS AND RESULTS Three hundred eighty acute MI patients with depression and 424 acute MI patients without depression were recruited. All underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring after hospital discharge. In univariate analyses, 4 indices of HRV were significantly lower in patients with depression than in patients without depression. Variables associated with HRV were then compared between patients with and without depression, and potential confounds were identified. These variables (age, sex, diabetes, and present cigarette smoking) were entered into an analysis of covariance model, followed by depression status. In the final model, all but one HRV index (high-frequency power) remained significantly lower in patients with depression than in patients without depression. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that greater autonomic dysfunction, as reflected by decreased HRV, is a plausible mechanism linking depression to increased cardiac mortality in post-MI patients.},

abstract = {Background: Depression is associated with an increased risk for mortality after acute myocardial infarction (MI). The purpose of this study was to determine whether low heart rate variability (HRV) mediates the effect of depression on mortality. Methods: Twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were obtained from 311 depressed patients with a recent acute MI who were enrolled in the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease (ENRICHD) clinical trial and from 367 nondepressed patients who met the ENRICHD medical inclusion criteria. Standard HRV indexes were extracted from the recordings. Results: The log of very low-frequency (LnVLF) power, an index of HRV derived from power spectral analysis of the electrocardiogram signal (0.0033-0.04 Hz [in milliseconds squared]), was lower in the depressed than in the nondepressed patients (P{\textless}.001). There were 47 deaths (6.1{\%}) during a 30-month follow-up. After adjusting for potential confounders, the depressed patients remained at higher risk for all-cause mortality compared with the nondepressed patients (hazard ratio, 2.8; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.4-5.4; P{\textless}.003). When LnVLF power was entered into the model, the hazard ratio for depression dropped to 2.1 (95{\%} CI, 1.1-4.2; P=.03). The proportion of the risk for depression attributable to LnVLF power was 0.27 (95{\%} CI, 0.23-0.31; P{\textless}.001). Conclusions: Low HRV partially mediates the effect of depression on survival after acute MI. This finding helps to clarify the physiological mechanisms underlying depression's role as a risk factor for mortality in patients with coronary heart disease. It also raises the possibility that treatments that improve both depression and HRV might also improve survival in these patients. {\textcopyright}2005 American Medical Association.

abstract = {Sudden cardiac death occurs as a result of a complex interplay of changes in myocardial substrate, imbalance of autonomic regulation of the heart, and myocardial vulnerability. Noninvasive electrocardiology serves as a comprehensive tool for investigating factors representing mechanistic pathways leading to cardiac events. Heart rate variability, nonlinear dynamics of heart rate, and heart rate turbulence provide insight into autonomic control of the heart. Prognostic value of these parameters in postinfarction patients is well established for predicting cardiac death, but there is less evidence for their association with sudden death or arrhythmic events. Electrical manifestation of changes in myocardial substrate include QRS and QTc prolongation, presence of conduction disturbances, presence of late potentials, abnormalities of repolarization morphology, and presence of nonsinus rhythm, namely atrial fibrillation. Electrocardiogram (ECG) measures reflecting myocardial vulnerability to arrhythmias include frequent ventricular premature beats, T wave alternans, or QT variability. Prognostic significance of these parameters is documented in studies focused mostly on them as individual markers of risk. The noninvasive electrocardiology substudy of the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator implantation Trial II (MADIT II) allows for simultaneous analysis of several of the above ECG markers of risk and will provide insight about relative contribution of mechanistic pathways leading to cardiac death in postinfarction patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction. Combination of a standard 12-lead ECG and 10-minute high-resolution Holter recordings serves to evaluate the prognostic significance of noninvasive electrocardiology parameters for mortality in patients randomized to conventional treatment and for arrhythmic events in patients randomized to implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy.},

@article{Eckberg1997,
abstract = {Given the importance of the autonomic nervous system to cardiovascular health, it is not surprising that there is and has been great interest in measurements of human sympathetic and vagus nerve traffic as tools that might inform physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms. Pagani and coworkers1 advanced the provocative notion that the instantaneous balance between sympathetic and vagal nerve activities can be captured by a single number, obtained by dividing RR-interval spectral power centered at ≈0.1 Hz by spectral power centered at higher, primarily respiratory frequencies. This ratio, or sympathovagal balance, has been embraced with great enthusiasm2 because it offers new possibilities for understanding dynamic, critically important autonomic interrelations in humans by the use of totally noninvasive, unobtrusive means.3 The broad bases for this mathematical treatment are as follows: (1) 0.1-Hz RR intervals are importantly mediated by fluctuations of sympathetic nerve activity; (2) higher-frequency RR-interval rhythms are mediated almost exclusively by fluctuations of vagal-cardiac nerve activity; and (3) physiological interventions tend to provoke reciprocal changes of sympathetic and vagal neural outflows. Sympathovagal balance, the ratio of these periodicities, is taken to reflect the balance between the opposing neural mechanisms. This review examines the physiological foundations of sympathovagal balance. Previous Section Next Section The Method and Its Mathematics The ECG is recorded with the subject in a steady state (when rhythms are stationary) for a period sufficiently long to define events occurring over frequencies of interest. RR-interval spectral power is calculated from this series of intervals with an autoregressive algorithm, which yields center frequencies and absolute power of component fluctuations, based on a model whose order (the number of parameters) is selected automatically to minimize Akaike's information criterion statistic.4 (The statistical uncertainty and consequences of the automatic selection of the autoregressive model have not been defined fully; however, it is clear that the model order importantly determines both center frequency and magnitude of spectral peaks.5) Autoregressive analyses of short (≤5 minutes) RR-interval time series typically yield three peaks in very low (0 to 0.04 Hz; VLF), low (0.04 to 0.15 Hz; LF), and respiratory or high (0.15 to 0.40 Hz; HF) frequency ranges.6 Published examples (Fig 1⇓ in Reference 11 and Figs 5c⇓ and 5d⇓ in Reference 66 ) suggest that in such short-term recordings, these three frequencies account for almost all spectral power (in the examples, 94.6{\%}, 96.1{\%}, and 98.5{\%}). Therefore, in practice, power in normalized (also called relative or fractional) units (nu) is power centered at the frequency of interest (LF or HF) divided by total power less power at VLFs. Thus, LF nu=LF/(LF+HF) and HF nu=HF/(LF+HF). Sympathovagal balance is the ratio between LF and respiratory-frequency powers. Sympathovagal balance (in dimensionless units) is simply the ratio of absolute LF to absolute HF power, or LF/HF. Figure 1.

Direct multifiber vagal-cardiac (VND) and sympathetic-cardiac (SND) nerve recordings from one anesthetized, decerebrate cat. Reproduced with permission.3 imp. indicates impulse; PSD, power spectral density. Several consequences issue from the mathematics of sympathovagal balance. First, a change of either the numerator or the denominator must change the fraction. Thus, a reduction of LF with no change of HF will reduce the fraction, and a reduction of HF with no change of LF will increase the fraction. According to published precedents,1,3 the former change would be interpreted as a shift of sympathovagal balance toward vagal predominance and the latter as a shift of sympathovagal balance toward sympathetic predominance. Second, because calculations of normalized LF and HF powers involve merely rearrangement of the same LF and HF terms, a change of normalized LF power must necessarily be associated with a change of normalized HF power. For the same reason, relations among the different calculated values can be predicted simply on the basis of mathematics. For example, if LF and HF are distributed nearly normally, sympathovagal balance, plotted as a function of normalized LF power, will be almost exponential. The remaining discussion touches on some of the physiological and pathophysiological processes that contribute to sympathovagal balance. The discussion is organized as a series of postulates that I believe tacitly or explicitly underlie the concept. The Numerator Human cardiovascular rhythms occurring at ≈0.1 Hz are of great interest because they convey information regarding activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Healthy humans may have strong fluctuations of muscle sympathetic nerve activity about every 10 seconds,7 a period that is sufficiently long for vascular smooth muscle and sinoatrial node effectors to respond to released norepinephrine and to modulate arterial pressure and heart rate.8 LF RR-Interval Rhythms Reflect Sympathetic Nerve Traffic to the Heart Malliani and coworkers3 published what may be the only power spectral analyses of sympathetic and vagus nerve traffic assumed but not proven to be destined for the heart. Fig 1⇑ shows preganglionic thoracic sympathetic and vagus nerve discharges measured from one artificially ventilated decerebrate cat. My integration of the two LF spectral powers in this figure suggests that sympathetic spectral power is ≈15{\%} greater than vagal spectral power. Kingwell and colleagues9 studied healthy supine subjects and found no significant correlation between myocardial norepinephrine spillover and absolute or relative 0.1-Hz RR-interval spectral power. Saul and coworkers10 also studied healthy supine subjects and found no significant correlation between baseline peroneal sympathetic nerve activity expressed as bursts/min (or antecubital vein plasma norepinephrine levels) and absolute or normalized LF heart rate spectral power. Hopf et al11 and Introna et al12 measured RR-interval spectral power before and after high spinal anesthesia. Sympathetic blockade in the supine position (but see responses to tilt below) did not alter absolute or relative 0.1-Hz RR-interval spectral power significantly. Pagani et al1 reported that propranolol 0.2 mg/kg IV does not reduce normalized 0.1-Hz RR-interval spectral power significantly. Moreover, Jokkel et al13 reported that short-term $\beta$-adrenergic blockade actually increases 0.1-Hz frequency RR-interval spectral power. Long-term $\beta$-adrenergic blockade reduces normalized 0.1-Hz RR-interval spectral power.1 Low-dose cholinergic blocking drugs, such as atropine and scopolamine, paradoxically increase average RR intervals14 and LF RR-interval spectral power.15 Increased LF spectral power is unlikely to be due to increased sympathetic nerve traffic because atropine does not alter (muscle) sympathetic nerve activity or plasma norepinephrine levels.16 Conversely, large-dose atropine abolishes nearly all RR-interval spectral power in LF as well as HF ranges.17,18 The simplest interpretation of the effects of large-dose atropine is that it blocks sinoatrial responses to acetylcholine released by vagus nerve traffic; atropine does not alter heart rate in the absence of vagus nerve activity.19 Thus, vagal contributions to baseline LF RR-interval fluctuations are great, and evidence that baseline LF RR-interval spectral power is related quantitatively to sympathetic-cardiac nerve traffic is nonexistent. Changes of 0.1-Hz RR-Interval Spectral Power Reflect Changes of Sympathetic-Cardiac Nerve Traffic Two groups have sought correlations between muscle sympathetic nerve traffic and heart rate or RR-interval spectral power over a range of arterial pressures provoked by graded infusions of nitroprusside and phenylephrine. Saul and coworkers10 found significant correlations between sympathetic nerve activity, expressed as bursts/min, and normalized LF heart rate spectral power, but only in 4 of 10 subjects studied. Pagani and associates20 found no significant correlation between sympathetic nerve activity, expressed as bursts/min, and normalized LF RR-interval spectral power. However, Pagani did find a highly significant but probably weak correlation between sympathetic nerve activity, expressed as burst area per second, and normalized LF RR-interval spectral power. The studies by Saul et al10 and Pagani et al20 differ in several respects. First, Saul normalized sympathetic bursts; Pagani did not. Normalization is necessary because burst heights differ among individuals; if sympathetic activity is not normalized, subjects with large sympathetic bursts will dominate average results. Second, subjects in the study by Saul et al controlled their breathing frequencies; those in the study by Pagani et al did not. As discussed below, breathing frequency profoundly influences spectral power measurements. Third, Saul reported individual regressions; Pagani did not. (It cannot be determined from the article by Pagani et al if there is a significant correlation between muscle sympathetic burst area per second and normalized LF RR-interval spectral power.) Rather, Pagani used a nonparametric regression analysis (Theil21) of all his data, both within and across subjects. This may have been inappropriate, because the Theil method requires that data be stochastically independent. Repeated measures (seven in each subject) violate this condition. Koh and coworkers18 also measured RR-interval spectral power during infusions of nitroprusside and phenylephrine. Fig 2⇓ shows RR-interval spectral power of healthy subjects and patients with complete high cervical spinal cord injuries during saline infusion and two or three levels of nitroprusside and phenylephrine.

abstract = {Aims: The ATRAMI (Autonomic Tone and Reflexes After Myocardial Infarction) study has proved the independent prognostic value of baroreflex sensitivity. A limitation of the traditional method of estimating baroreflex sensitivity by phenylephrine, is the need to monitor intra-arterial blood pressure. Our objective was to establish whether this invasive method of monitoring could be superseded by non-invasive methods, such as the Finapres device. Methods and Results: Patients with three repeated invasive and non-invasive baroreflex sensitivity measurements were selected from the ATRAMI database (n=454). The mean of these measurements was taken as the baroreflex sensitivity estimate. The repeatability of both methods (standard deviation of the three measurements) decreased with increasing baroreflex sensitivity. There was no constant bias between invasive and non-invasive measurements (0.22 ± 2.2 ms . mmHg-1, P=0.42). The linear correlation was very high (r=0.91, P{\textless}0.01). The normalized 95{\%} limits of agreement were -0.5 and 0.52. On survival analysis, invasive and non-invasive baroreflex sensitivity gave similar prognostic information (likelihood ratio: 155.6 (P=0.007) and 155.0 (P=0.006); risk ratio: 0.79 and 0.81, respectively). According to the ATRAMI cut-off points, 85{\%} of patients were classified concordantly by the two methods. None of the patients at high (low) risk with the invasive method were classified as low (high) risk class by the non-invasive method. Conclusion: Despite wide limits of agreement, invasive and non-invasive baroreflex sensitivity measurements are highly correlated and provide equivalent prognostic information.

Therefore, in this study we analyzed the heart rate variability (HRV) in different levels of practice in Zen meditation (Zazen). Nineteen subjects with variable experience took part in this study. In four special cases we collected both HRV and respiration data. The time series were analyzed in frequency domain and also using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, which detects changes in the time domain and in the frequency domain simultaneously. The shifts in the respiratory modulation of heart rate, or respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), reflect the different levels of practice among practitioners with variable experience in Zazen; in turn the modulation of the RSA may reflect changes in the breathing pattern as in the parasympathetic outflow related to the quality and focus of attention in each stage.},

abstract = {Binaural beats are an auditory illusion perceived when two or more pure tones of similar frequencies are presented dichotically through stereo headphones. Although this phenomenon is thought to facilitate state changes (e.g., relaxation), few empirical studies have reported on whether binaural beats produce changes in autonomic arousal. Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of binaural beating on autonomic dynamics [heart rate variability (HRV)] during post-exercise relaxation. Subjects (n = 21; 18-29 years old) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study during which binaural beats and placebo were administered over two randomized and counterbalanced sessions (within-subjects repeated-measures design). At the onset of each visit, subjects exercised for 20-min; post-exercise, subjects listened to either binaural beats ('wide-band' theta-frequency binaural beats) or placebo (carrier tones) for 20-min while relaxing alone in a quiet, low-light environment. Dependent variables consisted of high-frequency (HF, reflecting parasympathetic activity), low-frequency (LF, reflecting sympathetic and parasympathetic activity), and LF/HF normalized powers, as well as self-reported relaxation. As compared to the placebo visit, the binaural-beat visit resulted in greater self-reported relaxation, increased parasympathetic activation and increased sympathetic withdrawal. By the end of the 20-min relaxation period there were no observable differences in HRV between binaural-beat and placebo visits, although binaural-beat associated HRV significantly predicted subsequent reported relaxation. Findings suggest that listening to binaural beats may exert an acute influence on both LF and HF components of HRV and may increase subjective feelings of relaxation.},

@article{Huikuri2013,
abstract = {Heart rate (HR) variability has been extensively studied in cardiac patients, especially in patients surviving an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and also in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. The majority of studies have shown that patients with reduced or abnormal HR variability have an increased risk of mortality within a few years after an AMI or after a diagnosis of CHF/LV dysfunction. Various measures of HR dynamics, such as time-domain, spectral, and non-linear measures of HR variability have been used in risk stratification. The prognostic power of various measures, except of those reflecting rapid R-R interval oscillations, has been almost identical, albeit some non-linear HR variability measures, such as short-term fractal scaling exponent have provided somewhat better prognostic information than the others. Abnormal HR variability predicts both sudden and non-sudden cardiac death. Because of remodeling of the arrhythmia substrate after AMI, early measurement of HR variability to identify those at high risk should likely be repeated later in order to assess the risk of fatal arrhythmia events. Future randomized trials using HR variability/turbulence as one of the pre-defined inclusion criteria will show whether routine measurement of HR variability/turbulence will become a routine clinical tool for risk stratification of cardiac patients. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Identifying emotions in people with severe and profound intellectual disabilities is a difficult challenge. Since self-reports are not available, behaviour is the most used source of information. Given the limitations and caveats associated with using behaviour as the sole source of information about their emotions, it is important to supplement behavioural information with information from another source. As it is accepted that emotions consist of language, behaviour and physiology, in this article we investigated if physiology could give information about the emotions of people with severe and profound intellectual disabilities. To this aim we tested hypotheses derived from the motivational model of . Bradley, Codispoti, Cuthbert, and Lang (2001) about the relation between heart rate and the valence of emotions and between heart rate, skin conductance and skin temperature and behavioural expressions of emotions of people with severe and profound intellectual disability. We presented 27 participants with 4 staff-selected negative and 4 staff-selected positive stimuli. The situations were videotaped and their heart rate, skin conductance and skin temperature was measured. Each behaviour of the participant was coded using the observational method developed by . Petry and Maes (2006). As hypothesized, we found a lower heart rate when participants were presented with negative stimuli than when they were presented with positive stimuli in the first 6. s of stimuli presentation. Their skin temperature was higher for the expression of low intensity negative emotions compared to the expression of low intensity positive emotions. The results suggest that, as with people without disability, heart rate and skin temperature can give information about the emotions of persons with severe and profound ID. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Depression was determined according to the DSM-IV criteria using the PRIME-MD. HRV was measured with an electrocardiogram (ECG) during a 5-minute supine rest. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses showed statistically significant decrease in HRV in MDD patients compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Older primary care patients with MDD have a reduced HRV.

abstract = {Background: Heart rate variability (HRV) measures homeostatic regulation of the autonomic nervous system in response to perturbation and has been previously shown to quantify risk for cardiac events. Despite known interactions among stress vulnerability, psychiatric illness, and cardiac health, however, this is the first study to our knowledge to compare directly the value of laboratory HRV in predicting autonomic modulation of real-world emotional stress. Methods: We recorded electrocardiograms (ECG) on 56 subjects: first, within the laboratory and then during an acute emotional stressor: a first-time skydive. Laboratory sessions included two 5-min ECG recordings separated by one ambulatory 24-hour recording. To test the efficacy of introducing a mild emotional challenge, during each of the 5-min laboratory recordings, subjects viewed either aversive or benign images. Following the laboratory session, subjects participated in the acute stressor wearing a Holter ECG. Artifact-free ECGs (n = 33) were analyzed for HRV then statistically compared across laboratory and acute stress sessions. Results: There were robust correlations (r = .7-.8) between the laboratory and acute stress HRV, indicating that the two most useful paradigms (long-term wake, followed by short-term challenge) were also most sensitive to distinct components of the acute stressor: the former correlated with the fine-tuned regulatory modulation occurring immediately prior and following the acute stressor, whereas the latter correlated with gross amplitude and recovery. Conclusions: Our results confirmed the efficacy of laboratory-acquired HRV in predicting autonomic response to acute emotional stress and suggest that ambulatory and challenge protocols enhance predictive value. {\textcopyright} 2010 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

METHODS: We compared 10 sessions of biofeedback training with an uninstructed control. Cognitive and physiological effects were measured in four of the sessions. RESULTS: We found acute increases in low-frequency and total spectrum heart rate variability, and in vagal baroreflex gain, correlated with slow breathing during biofeedback periods. Increased baseline baroreflex gain also occurred across sessions in the biofeedback group, independent of respiratory changes, and peak expiratory flow increased in this group, independently of cardiovascular changes. Biofeedback was accompanied by fewer adverse relaxation side effects than the control condition. CONCLUSIONS: Heart rate variability biofeedback had strong long-term influences on resting baroreflex gain and pulmonary function. It should be examined as a method for treating cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Also, this study demonstrates neuroplasticity of the baroreflex.},

abstract = {Objectives: We determined the contribution of multiple variables to predict arrhythmic death and total mortality risk in patients with coronary disease and left ventricular dysfunction. We then constructed an algorithm to predict risk of mortality and sudden death. Background: Many factors in addition to ejection fraction (EF) influence the prognosis of patients with coronary disease. However, there are few tools to use this information to guide clinical decisions. Methods: We evaluated the relationship between 25 variables and total mortality and arrhythmic death in 674 patients enrolled in the MUSTT (Multicenter Unsustained Tachycardia Trial) study that did not receive antiarrhythmic therapy. We then constructed risk-stratification algorithms to weight the prognostic impact of each variable on arrhythmic death and total mortality risk. Results: The variables having the greatest prognostic impact in multivariable analysis were functional class, history of heart failure, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia not related to bypass surgery, EF, age, left ventricular conduction abnormalities, inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia, enrollment as an inpatient, and atrial fibrillation. The model demonstrates that patients whose only risk factor is EF ≤30{\%} have a predicted 2-year arrhythmic death risk {\textless}5{\%}. Conclusions: Multiple variables influence arrhythmic death and total mortality risk. Patients with EF ≤30{\%} but no other risk factor have low predicted mortality risk. Patients with EF {\textgreater}30{\%} and other risk factors may have higher mortality and a higher risk of sudden death than some patients with EF ≤30{\%}. Thus, risk of sudden death in patients with coronary disease depends on multiple variables in addition to EF. {\textcopyright} 2007 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {Background: Studies have linked depression to sudden death and serious cardiovascular events in patients with preexisting cardiac illness. Recent studies have shown decreased vagal function in cardiac patients with depression and depressed patients without cardiac illness. Methods: We compared 20-hour, sleeping, and awake heart period variability measures using spectral analysis, fractal dimension, and symbolic dynamics in two patient groups with major depression and ischemic heart disease (mean age 59-60 years) before and after 6 weeks of paroxetine or nortriptyline treatment. Results: Spectral measures showed decreases in awake and sleeping total power (TP: 0.0-0.5 Hz), ultra low frequency power (ULF: 0-0.0033 Hz), very low frequency power (VLF: 0.0033-0.04 Hz), and low-frequency power (LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz) for nortriptyline condition and a decrease in high-frequency power (HF: 0.15-0.5 Hz) for the awake condition in patients who received nortriptyline. A measure of nonlinear complexity, WC-100, significantly increased after paroxetine during the awake condition. Conclusions: These findings suggest that nortriptyline has stronger vagolytic effects on cardiac autonomic function compared with paroxetine, which is in agreement with previous clinical and preclinical reports. Paroxetine may have some cardio-protective effects, especially in cardiac patients.},

abstract = {Background: Our previous work has shown genetic variation in the human choline transporter gene (CHT1) to be associated with depressive symptoms and autonomic cardiac (cholinergic) dysregulation. Here, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine the relation between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in CHT1 on regional brain reactivity relevant to autonomic (cholinergic) function. Methods: Thirty-two participants of European ancestry (18 men, 14 women; age: 33-54 years) completed an fMRI protocol using corticolimbic reactivity and prefrontal inhibitory control paradigms. Resting cholinergic function, as measured by heart rate variability (HRV), was quantified from electrocardiogram Subjects were genotyped for a CHT1 G/T SNP. Results: GG homozygotes had greater right (R) dorsal amygdala (p {\textless} .008), bilateral anterior cingulate (p {\textless} .009), and R caudate reactivity (p {\textless} .015) than T-allele carriers. Heart rate variability was related to R frontal cortex (Brodmann Areas 6, 9, and 46), R hippocampal formation, bilateral caudate, and bilateral anterior cingulate reactivity (p's {\textless} .007). Conclusions: CHT1 variation is related to differences in a distributed corticolimbic circuitry mediating behavioral and physiologic arousal. These relations may contribute to a biological mechanism by which genetic variation in cholinergic neurotransmission affects cognition, mood, and autonomic cardiac function. {\textcopyright} 2006 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {Insulin resistance (IR), the hallmark of type 2 diabetes, may be under epigenetic control. This study examines the association between global DNA methylation and IR using 84 monozygotic twin pairs. IR was estimated using homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). Global DNA methylation of Alu repeats in peripheral blood leukocytes was quantified by bisulfite pyrosequencing. The association between global DNA methylation and IR was examined using generalized estimating equation (GEE) and within-twin pair analyses, adjusting for potential confounders. Results show that methylation levels at all four CpG sites were individually associated with IR by GEE (all false discovery rate-adjusted P values≤0.026). A 10{\%} increase in mean Alu methylation was associated with an increase of 4.55 units (95{\%} CI 2.38-6.73) in HOMA. Intrapair difference in IR was significantly associated with intrapair difference in global methylation level. A 10{\%} increase in the difference in mean Alu methylation was associated with an increase of 4.54 units (0.34-8.71; P=0.036) in the difference in HOMA. Confirmation of the results by intrapair analyses suggests that genetic factors do not confound the association between global DNA methylation and IR. Exclusion of twins taking diabetes medication (n=17) did not change our results.},

abstract = {Objective. Monitoring of regulated physiologic processes using physiomarkers such as heart rate variability may be important in the early diagnosis of subacute, potentially catastrophic illness. Early in the course of neonatal sepsis, there are physiomarkers of reduced heart rate variability and transient decelerations similar to fetal distress. The goal of this study was to determine the degree of increased risk for sepsis, urinary tract infection (UTI), and death when these abnormal heart rate characteristics (HRC) were observed.$\backslash$nMethods. We monitored 1022 infants at 2 tertiary care NICUs, 458 of whom were very low birth weight. We calculated an HRC index from validated regression models relating mathematical features of heart rate time series and histograms to episodes of illness. We calculated the risks for adverse events of sepsis, UTI, and death for infants stratified by HRC measurements.$\backslash$nResults. Compared with infants with low-risk HRC measurements, infants with high-risk HRC measurements had 5- to 6-fold increased risk for an adverse event in the next day and 3-fold increased risk in the next week. Laboratory tests that were relevant to infection added information to HRC measurements. Infants with both high-risk HRC and abnormal laboratory tests had 6- to 7-fold increased risk for an adverse event in the next day compared with infants who had neither.$\backslash$nConclusion. HRC are noninvasively monitored physiomarkers that identify infants in the NICU who are at high risk for sepsis, UTI, and death.},

abstract = {Background: Patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) who experience depressed mood or psychological stress exhibit decreased vagal control of heart rate (HR), as assessed by spectral analysis of HR variability (HRV). Myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death are independently associated with depression and stress, as well as impaired vagal HR control. This study examined whether a behavioral neurocardiac intervention to reduce stress or depression can augment cardiovagal modulation in CHD patients. We hypothesized that (1) cognitive-behavioral training with HRV biofeedback would augment vagal recovery from acute stress, and (2) vagal regulation of HR would be inversely associated with stress and depression after treatment. Methods: This randomized controlled trial enrolled 46 CHD patients from 3 clinics of CHD risk reduction in Toronto and Vancouver, Canada. Subjects were randomized to five 1.5-hour sessions of HRV biofeedback or an active control condition. Outcome was assessed by absolute and normalized high-frequency spectral components (0.15-0.50 Hz) of HRV, and by the Perceived Stress Scale and Centre for Epidemiologic Studies in Depression scale. Results: Both groups reduced symptoms on the Perceived Stress Scale (P =. 001) and Centre for Epidemiologic Studies in Depression scale (P =. 004). Hierarchical linear regression determined that improved psychological adjustment was significantly associated with the high-frequency index of vagal HR modulation only in the HRV biofeedback group. Adjusted R2was as follows: HRV biofeedback group, 0.86 for stress (P =. 02) and 0.81 for depression (P =. 03); versus the active control group, 0.04 (P =. 57) and 0.13 (P =. 95), respectively. Conclusion: A novel behavioral neurocardiac intervention, HRV biofeedback, can augment vagal HR regulation while facilitating psychological adjustment to CHD. {\textcopyright} 2005, Mosby, Inc.

abstract = {Introduction: Mental stress ischemia (MSI) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular outcomes and death in CAD patients, but little is known about the mechanisms behind this phenomenon. We hypothesized that alterations in autonomic function before, during, or after mental stress may play a role. We examined whether MSI positive patients with CAD have reduced parasympathetic (PNS) tone, as measured by high frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV), as well as reduced baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS), as approximated by low frequency (LF) HRV at baseline, peak mental stress, and recovery.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nMethods: A mental stress test with a standardized speech stressor was performed in 425 CAD patients wearing an ambulatory ECG monitor. Myocardial perfusion imaging was performed with TC-99m Sestamibi. After careful editing for artifacts and ectopic beats, HF HRV and LF HRV were measured for 5-min periods during a baseline rest period, 5 min of speech, and 5 min of recovery. Logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounders.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nResults: The mean (SD) age was 63 (9) years, 26{\%} were women, and 30{\%} were African American; 42 (10{\%}) patients developed MSI. Compared with MSI negative, MSI positive patients had lower HF HRV and LF HRV during rest, stress, and recovery. The largest difference was observed during stress; HF HRV was 46{\%} lower (p=0.01), and LF HRV was 44{\%} lower (p=0.01). When examining reactivity to stress (difference between stress and rest), only LF HRV was significantly different between groups, such that MSI positive patients had an average 32{\%} reduction in LF HRV with stress, while MSI negative patients had an average 3{\%} increase (p=0.04). LF HRV reactivity remained an independent predictor of MSI (p=0.01) in models adjusting for sociodemographics, traditional risk factors, antidepressants, beta-blocker use, revascularization history, heart failure, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and heart rate/blood pressure reactivity.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nConclusions: Autonomic factors, most notably reduced LF HRV reactivity, predict MSI in CAD patients. This implies reduced BRS and autonomic inflexibility as an important pathophysiological component of the ischemic response to mental stress.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To clarify the relationship between depression and heart rate variability (HRV) in a sample of twins. Reduced HRV, a measure of autonomic dysfunction, has been linked to depression but many studies have inadequately controlled for familial and environmental factors. Furthermore, little is known about whether depression and HRV share common genetic pathways.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We performed power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms in 288 middle-aged male twins. Log-normalized ultra low, very low, low, high frequency, and total power were calculated. A lifetime history of major depressive disorder (MDD) was determined, using the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders, and current depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory. Mixed-effect regression models were used to account for intrapair variability and estimate within-pair effects at the same time controlling for potential confounders.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Both current depressive symptoms and a history of MDD were significantly associated with lower HRV. There was a graded effect, and power in each frequency band was 29{\%} to 36{\%} lower in the lowest band compared with the highest BDI category. All HRV measures except high frequency remained significantly associated with current depressive symptoms in multivariable analysis, but not with lifetime history of MDD. When analyses were stratified by zygosity, a significant within-pair association between BDI score and HRV was found in the dizygotic but not in the monozygotic twins, suggesting a genetic influence on the association.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: A shared, genetically influenced biological pathway underlies the association between depression and lower HRV. These two phenotypes may be the expression of a generalized neurobiological perturbation.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis has emerged as an important research topic to evaluate autonomic cardiac function. However, traditional time and frequency-domain analysis characterizes and quantify only linear and stationary phenomena. In the present investigation, we made a comparative analysis of three alternative approaches (i.e., wavelet multifractal analysis, Lyapunov exponents and multiscale entropy analysis) for quantifying nonlinear dynamics in heart rate time series. Note that these extracted nonlinear features provide information about nonlinear scaling behaviors and the complexity of cardiac systems. To evaluate the performance, we used 24-hour HRV recordings from 54 healthy subjects and 29 heart failure patients, available in PhysioNet. Three nonlinear methods are evaluated not only individually but also in combination using three classification algorithms, i.e., linear discriminate analysis, quadratic discriminate analysis and k-nearest neighbors. Experimental results show that three nonlinear methods capture nonlinear dynamics from different perspectives and the combined feature set achieves the best performance, i.e., sensitivity 97.7{\%} and specificity 91.5{\%}. Collectively, nonlinear HRV features are shown to have the promise to identify the disorders in autonomic cardiovascular function.},

abstract = {We investigated a neural reflex that controls the strength of inflammatory responses to immune challenge - the inflammatory reflex. In anaesthetized rats challenged with intravenous lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 60 mug kg(-1)), we found strong increases in plasma levels of the key inflammatory mediator tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) 90 min later. Those levels were unaffected by previous bilateral cervical vagotomy, but were enhanced approximately 5-fold if the greater splanchnic sympathetic nerves had been cut. Sham surgery had no effect, and plasma corticosterone levels were unaffected by nerve sections, so could not explain this result. Electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that efferent neural activity in the splanchnic nerve and its splenic branch was strongly increased by LPS treatment. Splenic nerve activity was dependent on inputs from the splanchnic nerves: vagotomy had no effect on the activity in either nerve. Together, these data demonstrate that immune challenge with this dose of LPS activates a neural reflex that is powerful enough to cause an 80{\%} suppression of the acute systemic inflammatory response. The efferent arm of this reflex is in the splanchnic sympathetic nerves, not the vagi as previously proposed. As with other physiological responses to immune challenge, the afferent pathway is presumptively humoral: the present data show that vagal afferents play no measurable part. Because inflammation sits at the gateway to immune responses, this reflex could play an important role in immune function as well as inflammatory diseases.},

abstract = {Background: Studies have linked depression to sudden death and serious cardiovascular events in patients with preexisting cardiac illness. Recent studies have shown decreased vagal function in cardiac patients with depression and depressed patients without cardiac illness. Methods: We compared 20-hour, sleeping, and awake heart period variability measures using spectral analysis, fractal dimension, and symbolic dynamics in two patient groups with major depression and ischemic heart disease (mean age 59-60 years) before and after 6 weeks of paroxetine or nortriptyline treatment. Results: Spectral measures showed decreases in awake and sleeping total power (TP: 0.0-0.5 Hz), ultra low frequency power (ULF: 0-0.0033 Hz), very low frequency power (VLF: 0.0033-0.04 Hz), and low-frequency power (LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz) for nortriptyline condition and a decrease in high-frequency power (HF: 0.15-0.5 Hz) for the awake condition in patients who received nortriptyline. A measure of nonlinear complexity, WC-100, significantly increased after paroxetine during the awake condition. Conclusions: These findings suggest that nortriptyline has stronger vagolytic effects on cardiac autonomic function compared with paroxetine, which is in agreement with previous clinical and preclinical reports. Paroxetine may have some cardio-protective effects, especially in cardiac patients.},

Based on these results, a new and clinically relevant index of multiscale entropy was developed that scores the key features of a multiscale entropy profile. Contrary to multiscale entropy, multiscale entropy scoring can be followed as a function of time to monitor disease progression with limited loss of information.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS:: Analysis of multiscale complexity of beat-to-beat dynamics at high temporal resolution has potential as a sensitive prognostic tool with translational power that can predict survival outcome in systemic inflammatory conditions such as sepsis and septic shock.},

Timely prediction of VTA, using heart rate variability (HRV) analysis techniques, may facilitate the implementation of preventive and therapeutic strategies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAIM: To evaluate the novel multipole method of the HRV analysis in prediction of imminent VTAs in ICD patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We screened patients from the Biotronik HAWAI Registry (Heart Rate Analysis with Automated ICDs). A total of 28 patients from the HAWAI registries (phase I and II), having medical records, who had experienced documented, verified VTA during the 2-year follow-up, were included in our analysis. HRV during preepisode recordings of 4,500 R-R intervals were analyzed using the Dyx parameter and compared to HRV of similar length recordings from the same patients that were not followed by arrhythmia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Our study population consisted mainly of men 25 of 28 (89{\%}), average age of 64.8 ± 9.4 years, 92{\%} with coronary artery disease. HRV during 64 preevent recordings (2.3 events per patient on average) was analyzed and compared with 60 control recordings. The multipole method of HRV analysis showed 50{\%} sensitivity and 91.6{\%} specificity for prediction of ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation in the study population, with 84.5{\%} positive predictive value. No statistically significant correlation was found between various clinical parameters and the sensitivity of imminent VTA predetection in our patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The multipole method of HRV analysis emerges as a highly specific, possible predictor of imminent VTA, providing an early warning allowing to prepare for an arrhythmic episode.},

abstract = {Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) develops following exposure to atraumatic event and is characterized by persistent intense reactivity to trauma related cues. Equally important, but less studied, is the failure to restore physiological homeostasis after these excessive reactions. This study investigates psychophysiological markers of sustained cardiac activity after exposure to reminders of traumatic event in PTSD patients. Methods: Participants passively listened to neutral and personal traumatic event while electrocardiogram was continuously recorded. Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) were analyzed in 19 PTSD patients and 16 trauma-exposed controls. Results: Both PTSD patients and trauma exposed controls exhibited a significant increase in HR to the exposure of their personal trauma. PTSD patients sustained the increase of HR while controls recovered to basal levels. In PTSD patients, sustained HR was positively associated with re-experiencing symptoms. The PTSD group also showed a reduced HRV (a measure of parasympathetic influence on the heart) during personal trauma exposure and lack of recovery. Limitations: The sample size was small and PTSD patients were under medication. Conclusions: Our findings provide an experimental account of the failure of PTSD patients to exhibit physiological recovery after exposure to trauma-related stimuli. PTSD patients exhibited a sustained tachycardia with attenuation of HRV that persisted even after cessation of the stressor. Re-experiencing symptoms facilitated engagement in the trauma cues, suggesting that, in their daily-life, patients most likely present repeated episodes of sustained over-reactivity, which may underpin the emotional dysregulation characteristic of PTSD. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Our meta-analyses replicated the previously known locus for ADMA levels in DDAH1 (rs997251; P = 1.4 × 10(-40)), identified two non-synomyous polymorphisms for SDMA levels in AGXT2 (rs37369; P = 1.4 × 10(-40) and rs16899974; P = 1.5 × 10(-38)) and one in SLC25A45 (rs34400381; P = 2.5 × 10(-10)). We also fine-mapped the AGXT2 locus for further independent association signals. The two non-synonymous AGXT2 variants independently associated with SDMA levels were also significantly related with short-term heart rate variability (HRV) indices in young adults. The major allele (C) of the novel non-synonymous rs16899974 (V498L) variant associated with decreased SDMA levels and an increase in the ratio between the low- and high-frequency spectral components of HRV (P = 0.00047). Furthermore, the SDMA decreasing allele (G) of the non-synomyous SLC25A45 (R285C) variant was associated with a lower resting mean heart rate during the HRV measurements (P = 0.0046), but not with the HRV indices. None of the studied genome-wide significant variants had any major effect on cardiovascular or total mortality in patients referred for coronary angiography.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: AGXT2 has an important role in SDMA metabolism in humans. AGXT2 may additionally have an unanticipated role in the autonomic nervous system regulation of cardiac function.},

However the interaction between these two systems remains largely unexplored in humans. The aim of this study was to investigate whether directly recorded sympathetic vasoconstrictor outflow is related to a surrogate marker of endothelial function in healthy individuals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: In 10 healthy normotensive subjects (3 f/7 m), (age 37+/-11 yrs), (BMI 24+/-3 kg/m(2)) direct recordings of sympathetic action potentials to the muscle vascular bed (MSNA) were performed and endothelial function estimated with the Reactive Hyperaemia- Peripheral Arterial Tonometry (RH-PAT) technique. Blood samples were taken and time spent on leisure-time physical activities was estimated. In all subjects the rate between resting flow and the maximum flow, the Reactive Hyperemic index (RH-PAT index), was within the normal range (1.9-3.3) and MSNA was as expected for age and gender (13-44 burst/minute). RH-PAT index was inversely related to MSNA (r = -0.8, p = 0.005). RH-PAT index and MSNA were reciprocally related to time (h/week) spent on physical activity (p = 0.005 and p = 0.006 respectively) and platelet concentration (PLT) (p = 0.02 and p = 0.004 respectively).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results show that sympathetic nerve activity is related to a surrogate marker of endothelial function in healthy normotensive individuals, indicating that sympathetic outflow may be modulated by changes in endothelial function. In this study time spent on physical activity is identified as a predictor of sympathetic nerve activity and endothelial function in a group of healthy individuals. The results are of importance in understanding mechanisms underlying sympathetic activation in conditions associated with endothelial dysfunction and emphasise the importance of a daily exercise routine for maintenance of cardiovascular health.},

The aim of this study was to test if Dyx can improve risk stratification for malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias and to test if the previously identified cut-off can be reproduced. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 248 patients from the CARISMA study with ejection fraction ≤40{\%} after an acute myocardial infarction and an analysable 24 h Holter recording. All patients received an implantable cardiac monitor, which was used to diagnose the primary endpoint of near-fatal or fatal ventricular tachyarrhythmias likely preventable by an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), during a period of 2 years. A Dyx ≤ 1.96 was considered abnormal. The secondary endpoint was cardiovascular death. At enrolment 59 patients (24{\%}) had a Dyx ≤ 1.96 and 20 experienced a primary endpoint. A Dyx ≤ 1.96 was associated with a significantly increased risk for malignant arrhythmias [hazards ratio (HR) = 4.36 (1.81–10.52), P = 0.001] and cardiovascular death [HR = 3.47 (1.38–8.74), P = 0.008]. Compared with important clinical risk parameters (age {\textgreater}70 years and QRS {\textgreater} 120 ms), Dyx ≤ 1.96 significantly added predictive value (P = 0.0066). CONCLUSIONS: Dyx was a better predictor of ventricular tachyarrhythmias than the traditional measures of HRV and heart rate turbulence, particularly in the elderly. Dyx might be a useful tool for better selection of ICD candidates in the elderly population, since a normal Dyx in this group was associated with a very low risk for malignant ventricular arrhythmias.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postexercise measurement of heart rate (HR) recovery and QT interval dynamics provides prognostic information in various patient populations. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess whether the measurement of the spatial relationship between the depolarization and repolarization wavefronts (total cosine R-to-T [TCRT]) during the postexercise recovery phase would yield prognostic information. METHODS: The population consisted of 1297 patients (56 ± 13 years; 67{\%} men) who performed a clinically indicated bicycle stress test. The exercise-recovery hysteresis of TCRT was quantified from the 12-lead exercise electrocardiogram by measuring the TCRT/HR loop area bounded by the exercise and first 3-minute postexercise recovery curves. The HR-corrected TCRT/HR hysteresis was calculated by dividing the area with the HR decrement during the first 3 minutes of recovery. HR recovery was measured at 1 minute postexercise recovery. End points were cardiac death and sudden cardiac death. RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 45 ± 12 months, 74 patients died (5.7{\%}); 35 (2.6{\%}) were cardiac deaths and 24 (1.9{\%}) were sudden cardiac deaths. Reduced TCRT/HR loop area and TCRT/HR hysteresis were associated with cardiac mortality (P {\textless}.001). After adjustments for clinical variables, including ejection fraction, TCRT/HR loop area remained an independent predictor of cardiac death (hazard ratio 5.6; 95{\%} confidence interval 1.6-19.1; P = .007) and sudden cardiac death (10.7; 95{\%} confidence interval 1.4-83.7; P = .024). HR recovery did not remain a significant predictor in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Attenuated hysteresis of the depolarization and repolarization wavefronts during postexercise recovery is associated with an increased risk of cardiac and sudden cardiac death. Analysis of repolarization dynamics from exercise electrocardiogram represents a promising tool for risk stratification. {\textcopyright} 2012 Heart Rhythm Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heritable electrocardiographic (ECG) and heart rate variability (HRV) measures, reflecting pacemaking, conduction, repolarization and autonomic function in the heart have been associated with risks for cardiac arrhythmias. Whereas several rare monogenic conditions with extreme phenotypes have been noted, few common genetic factors contributing to interindividual variability in ECG and HRV measures have been identified. We report the results of a community-based genomewide association study of six ECG and HRV intermediate traits.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Genotyping using Affymetrix 100K GeneChip was conducted on 1345 related Framingham Heart Study Original and Offspring cohort participants. We analyzed 1175 Original and Offspring participants with ECG data (mean age 52 years, 52{\%} women) and 548 Offspring participants with HRV data (mean age 48 years, 51{\%} women), in relation to 70,987 SNPs with minor allele frequency {\textgreater} or = 0.10, call rate {\textgreater} or = 80{\%}, Hardy-Weinberg p-value {\textgreater} or = 0.001. We used generalized estimating equations to test association of SNP alleles with multivariable-adjusted residuals for QT, RR, and PR intervals, the ratio of low frequency to high frequency power (LF/HFP), total power (TP) and the standard deviation of normal RR intervals (SDNN).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Associations at p {\textless} 10(-3) were found for 117 (QT), 105 (RR), 111 (PR), 102 (LF/HF), 121 (TP), and 102 (SDNN) SNPs. Several common variants in NOS1AP (4 SNPs with p-values {\textless} 10(-3); lowest p-value, rs6683968, p = 1 x 10(-4)) were associated with adjusted QT residuals, consistent with our previously reported finding for NOS1AP in an unrelated sample of FHS Offspring and other cohorts. All results are publicly available at NCBI's dbGaP at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007 webcite.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: In the community-based Framingham Heart Study none of the ECG and HRV results individually attained genomewide significance. However, the presence of bona fide QT-associated SNPs among the top 117 results for QT duration supports the importance of efforts to validate top results from the reported scans. Finding genetic variants associated with ECG and HRV quantitative traits may identify novel genes and pathways implicated in arrhythmogenesis and allow for improved recognition of individuals at high risk for arrhythmias in the general population.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Major depression is a common problem in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and is associated with an increased risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality. It is not known whether treating depression will improve medical prognosis in patients with CHD. Depression is also associated with elevated heart rate and reduced heart rate variability (HRV), which are known risk factors for cardiac morbidity and mortality that may explain the increased risk associated with depression. The purpose of this study was to determine whether treatment for depression with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is associated with decreased heart rate or increased HRV. METHODS Thirty depressed patients with stable CHD, classified as either mildly or moderately to severely depressed, received up to 16 sessions of CBT. The 24-hour heart rate and HRV were measured in these patients and in 22 medically comparable nondepressed controls before and after treatment of the depressed patients. RESULTS Average heart rate and daytime rMSSD (reflecting mostly parasympathetic activity) improved significantly in the severely depressed patients, but remained unchanged in the mildly depressed and the control patients. However, only rMSSD improved to a level comparable to the control patients. None of the remaining indices of HRV showed improvement. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that treating depression with CBT may reduce heart rate and increase short-term HRV. Thus, CBT may have a beneficial effect on a risk factor for mortality in depressed patients with coronary heart disease. A randomized, controlled study is needed to confirm these findings.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Studies of the genetics of obstructive sleep apnea may be facilitated by identifying intermediate traits with high heritability that quantify etiological pathways, such as those related to respiratory control. Electrocardiogram (ECG)-based sleep spectrograms, measuring the coupling between respiratory modulation of ECG QRS-wave amplitude and heart rate variability, may provide measures of sleep state and ventilatory dynamics during sleep. We evaluated the familial aggregation of distinctive spectrographic biomarkers of unstable sleep, related to elevated-low frequency cardiopulmonary coupling (e-LFC), to assess their utility in genetic studies. METHODS: 622 participants from 137 families from the Cleveland Family Study underwent standardized polysomnography (PSG). From the ECG signal on the PSG, the interbeat interval time series and the corresponding ECG-derived respiratory signal were extracted, and the low frequency (0.01-0.1 Hz) component of their coupling was computed using a fully automated method. Narrow sense heritability of e-LFC was calculated using variance component methods. RESULTS: A spectral marker of abnormal low frequency cardiopulmonary coupling (e-LFC) demonstrated moderate correlation with apnea hypopnea index (AHI; r = 0.35, P {\{}{\textless}{\}} 0.0001). The heritability estimate for e-LFC, after adjusting for age and sex was 0.32 (P {\{}{\textless}{\}} 10-5) and remained unchanged after additionally adjusting for body mass index or AHI. In biological relatives of those with sleep apnea, a related marker of e-LFC was more prevalent than in controls (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 30{\{}{\%}{\}} of the variability of e-LFC, measured from a continuous ECG during sleep, is explained by familial factors other than BMI. ECG-based spectrographic measures of cardiopulmonary coupling may provide novel phenotypes for characterizing subgroups of individuals with different propensities and genetic etiologies for sleep apnea or for other conditions associated with sleep fragmentation.},

abstract = {Exposure to combat experiences is associated with increased risk of developing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Prolonged exposure therapy and cognitive processing therapy have garnered a significant amount of empirical support for PTSD treatment; however, they are not universally effective with some patients continuing to struggle with residual PTSD symptoms. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a measure of the autonomic nervous system functioning and reflects an individual's ability to adaptively cope with stress. A pilot study was undertaken to determine if veterans with PTSD (as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale and the PTSD Checklist) would show significantly different HRV prior to an intervention at baseline compared to controls; specifically, to determine whether the HRV among veterans with PTSD is more depressed than that among veterans without PTSD. The study also aimed at assessing the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of providing HRV biofeedback as a treatment for PTSD. The findings suggest that implementing an HRV biofeedback as a treatment for PTSD is effective, feasible, and acceptable for veterans. Veterans with combat-related PTSD displayed significantly depressed HRV as compared to subjects without PTSD. When the veterans with PTSD were randomly assigned to receive either HRV biofeedback plus treatment as usual (TAU) or just TAU, the results indicated that HRV biofeedback significantly increased the HRV while reducing symptoms of PTSD. However, the TAU had no significant effect on either HRV or symptom reduction. A larger randomized control trial to validate these findings appears warranted.

abstract = {This study investigated cardiac autonomic function in patients with panic disorder and normal controls using Holter ECG records. A decrease in ultra- low frequency power ({\textless} 0.0033 Hz) is known to be associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular mortality in humans. Twenty-four-hour ECG was recorded in 29 patients with panic disorder and 23 normal controls using Holter records. Data for 20 h and also 20 000 s of awake and 20 000 s of sleep periods were analyzed using spectral analysis to quantify absolute and relative heart-period variability in ultra low (ULF: {\textless} 0.0033 Hz), very low (VLF: 0.0033-0.04 Hz), low (LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz) and high (HF: 0.15-0.5 Hz) frequency bands. The patients with panic disorder had significantly lower total and absolute ULF power, which was more pronounced during sleep. The patients also had significantly lower relative ULF power and significantly higher relative LF power during sleep. There was a significant increase of relative LF power from awake to sleep period only in the patient group. The decrease in total and ULF power may increase the risk of mortality and sudden arrhythmic death in patients with panic disorder if they experience a cardiac event. The higher relative LF power during sleep also suggests a possible higher sympathetic drive in the patients during sleep.},

abstract = {The connection between the heart and the brain has long been anecdotally recognized but has systematically been studied only relatively recently. Cardiac arrhythmias, especially ventricular arrhythmias that can lead to sudden cardiac death, remain a major public health concern and there is mounting evidence that psychological distress plays a critical role both as a predictor of high-risk cardiac substrate and as an inciting trigger. The transient, unpredictable nature of emotions and cardiac arrhythmias has made their study challenging, but evolving technologies in monitoring and imaging along with larger epidemiological data sets have encouraged more sophisticated studies examining this relationship. Here we review the research on psychological distress including anger, depression and anxiety on cardiac arrhythmias, insights into proposed mechanisms, and potential avenues for future research. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine reduces blood pressure more effectively in White than Black Americans despite similar degrees of sympatholysis. Functional genetic variation in receptor signaling mechanisms, for example in the beta 3 G-protein subunit (GNB3 C825T) and in the alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor subtype (ADRA2C del322-325), may affect drug responses. We examined the hypothesis that there are ethnic differences in the responses to the highly selective alpha(2)-agonist, dexmedetomidine, and that these genetic variants contribute to interindividual variability in drug responses. In a placebo-controlled, single-masked study, 73 healthy subjects (37 whites and 36 blacks) received 3 placebo infusions and then 3 incremental doses of dexmedetomidine (cumulative dose, 0.4 microg/kg), each separated by 30 minutes. Blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma catecholamine concentrations were determined after each infusion. We measured dexmedetomidine concentrations after the last infusion and determined ADRA2C del322-325 and GNB3 C825T genotypes. Dexmedetomidine lowered blood pressure and plasma catecholamine concentrations significantly (all P{\textless}0.001). There was substantial interindividual variability in the reduction of systolic blood pressure (range, 1 to 34 mm Hg) and plasma norepinephrine concentrations (range, 24 to 424 pg/mL). However, there were no differences between black and white subjects in dexmedetomidine responses (P{\textgreater}0.16 for all outcomes) before or after adjustment for covariates. Neither ADRA2C del322-325 nor GNB3 C825T genotypes affected the responses to dexmedetomidine (all P{\textgreater}0.66). There is large interindividual variability in response to the selective alpha(2)-AR agonist dexmedetomidine, and neither ethnicity nor ADRA2C and GNB3 genotypes contribute to it. Further studies to identify determinants of alpha(2)-AR-mediated responses will be of interest.},

Our meta-analyses replicated the previously known locus for ADMA levels in DDAH1 (rs997251; P = 1.4 × 10(-40)), identified two non-synomyous polymorphisms for SDMA levels in AGXT2 (rs37369; P = 1.4 × 10(-40) and rs16899974; P = 1.5 × 10(-38)) and one in SLC25A45 (rs34400381; P = 2.5 × 10(-10)). We also fine-mapped the AGXT2 locus for further independent association signals. The two non-synonymous AGXT2 variants independently associated with SDMA levels were also significantly related with short-term heart rate variability (HRV) indices in young adults. The major allele (C) of the novel non-synonymous rs16899974 (V498L) variant associated with decreased SDMA levels and an increase in the ratio between the low- and high-frequency spectral components of HRV (P = 0.00047). Furthermore, the SDMA decreasing allele (G) of the non-synomyous SLC25A45 (R285C) variant was associated with a lower resting mean heart rate during the HRV measurements (P = 0.0046), but not with the HRV indices. None of the studied genome-wide significant variants had any major effect on cardiovascular or total mortality in patients referred for coronary angiography.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: AGXT2 has an important role in SDMA metabolism in humans. AGXT2 may additionally have an unanticipated role in the autonomic nervous system regulation of cardiac function.},

abstract = {Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) has been used as an index of parasympathetic cardiac control. However, recent psychophysiological research casts serious doubts upon the usefulness of RSA as an index of vagal influences upon the heart in psychophysiological as well as in clinical studies. It suggests the need to look for another measure. In this exploratory study we investigated whether the baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) could serve as an alternative tool to investigate between-subject tonic parasympathetic influences on the heart. In nine healthy subjects we examined the effects of intravenous atropine (0.03 mg/kg i.v.), intravenous metoprolol (10-15 mg i.v.), and of saline as a placebo condition upon RSA, BRS, and related cardiovascular and respiratory variables, both under resting and under mental task conditions. After parasympathetic blockade, RSA and BRS display values near zero, showing their vagal origin. After beta-adrenergic blockade, when heart period is predominantly under vagal control, RSA fails to predict heart period variability. Using BRS, however, it is possible to predict more than 97{\%} of heart period variance during beta-blockade. Finally, both the vagal and beta-adrenergic blockade show that BRS is a better predictor of parasympathetic cardiac control during blood pressure increases than during blood pressure decreases.},

abstract = {This study examined the effects on healthy adults of a new emotional self-management program, consisting of two key techniques, "Cut-Thru" and the "Heart Lock-In." These techniques are designed to eliminate negative thought loops and promote sustained positive emotional states. The hypotheses were that training and practice in these techniques would yield lowered levels of stress and negative emotion and cortisol, while resulting in increased positive emotion and DHEA levels over a one-month period. In addition, we hypothesized that increased coherence in heart rate variability patterns would be observed during the practice of the techniques. Forty-five healthy adults participated in the study, fifteen of whom acted as a comparison group for the psychological measures. Salivary DHEA/DHEAS and cortisol levels were measured, autonomic nervous system function was assessed by heart rate variability analysis, and emotions were measured using a psychological questionnaire. Individuals in the experimental group were assessed before and four weeks after receiving training in the self-management techniques. The experimental group experienced significant increases in the positive affect scales of Caring and Vigor and significant decreases in the negative affect scales of Guilt, Hostility, Burnout, Anxiety and Stress Effects, while no significant changes were seen in the comparison group. There was a mean 23 percent reduction in cortisol and a 100 percent increase in DHEA/DHEAS in the experimental group. DHEA was significantly and positively related to the affective state Warmheartedness, whereas cortisol was significantly and positively related to Stress Effects. Increased coherence in heart rate variability patterns was measured in 80 percent of the experimental group during the use of the techniques. The results suggest that techniques designed to eliminate negative thought loops can have important positive effects on stress, emotions and key physiological systems. The implications are that relatively inexpensive interventions may dramatically and positively impact individuals' health and well-being. Thus, individuals may have greater control over their minds, bodies and health than previously suspected.},

abstract = {Depression is common in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and is a risk factor for cardiac morbidity and mortality in these patients. Depression is associated with autonomic nervous system dysfunction, which may at least partially explain this increased risk. Low heart rate variability (HRV), which reflects excessive sympathetic and/or inadequate parasympathetic modulation of heart rate, is a strong predictor of mortality in patients with CHD. Most studies-both in patients with stable CHD and in patients with a recent acute coronary event-have found HRV to be lower in depressed patients than in their nondepressed counterparts. This manuscript provides an overview of this literature and concludes that HRV may account for a substantial part of the risk associated with depression in CHD.},

abstract = {It has long been hypothesized that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) increases coronary heart disease (CHD) risk; however, empirical evidence is limited. In the first prospective study to date, individuals with higher PTSD symptom levels had a significantly increased risk for CHD, after controlling for known coronary risk factors. PTSD indicates a chronic stress reaction and is hypothesized to influence CHD either by causing biological alterations that lead to cardiovascular damage, or by leading to adverse health behaviors that increase CHD risk. A key issue is whether PTSD contributes to the development of CHD, if PTSD and CHD share common pathways, or if CHD causes PTSD. Research combined across different disciplines suggests that prolonged or chronic stress does influence the development of CHD. A better understanding of the relationship will increase prevention and intervention efforts. Cardiologists may be most effective when they can recognize and manage emotional distress in practice.},

HRV is a measure of cardiac autonomic functioning. METHOD: A cross-sectional comparison of 136 elderly persons with MDD and 136 non-depressed controls (matched for age and gender) recruited in family practices in the Netherlands. Depression was determined according to the DSM-IV criteria using the PRIME-MD. HRV was measured with an electrocardiogram (ECG) during a 5-minute supine rest. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses showed statistically significant decrease in HRV in MDD patients compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Older primary care patients with MDD have a reduced HRV. This may explain why depression is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality.},

Ten divers were exposed to pressures of 1, 2, 3, and 4 atmospheres absolute (ATA). The test was performed in a hyperbaric chamber. Heart rate (HR) was recorded in supine subjects for 10 minutes per atmosphere. HRV was analyzed in the frequency mode (fast-Fourier transform and continuous wavelet transform). Results confirmed bradycardia as pressure increased. The drop in HR attained statistical significance after 2, 3, and 4 ATA. Signal energy (normalized TP values) rose progressively, becoming significant at 2 ATA. High frequency and low frequency displayed similar behavior in both cases. Although frequency band peaks did not yield clear results, continuous wave transform analysis showed that the frequency spectrum tended to shift into the high-frequency range as pressure increased. In summary, increased pressure prompted increased bradycardia, and HRV shifted into high-frequency range.},

abstract = {Investigated cardiac autonomic function in 16 Ss (mean age 37.3 yrs) with panic disorder before and after treatment with paroxetine using Holter ECG records. Previous data suggest a relative increase in sympathetic activity in Ss with panic disorder, especially during sleep. Data for 20 hrs and awake and sleep periods were analyzed using spectral analysis to quantify absolute and relative heart period variability in ultra low (ULF), very low (VLF), low (LF) and high (HF) frequency bands. The authors also obtained fractal dimensions (FDs) for the 20-hour, awake, and sleep time series of RR intervals. Paroxetine treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the frequency and intensity of panic attacks and also on the state anxiety inventory. Paroxetine treatment produced a significant decrease of 20-hr absolute HF power, awake absolute LF power, and sleep absolute HF power. There was also a significant decrease of FDs after treatment with paroxetine for the sleep period. The decrease in LF and HF powers, and sleep FD is likely due to the antimuscarinic effect of paroxetine. The decrease in day-time LF power may also be due to a decrease in relative cardiac sympathetic activity after paroxetine treatment.

The present study examined associations among severity of lifetime victimization, current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and heart rate (AHR) levels and variability. Thirty-nine healthy post-menopausal women who endorsed a history of criminal victimization completed a measure of PTSD symptom severity and participated in an average of 18 h of ambulatory cardiovascular monitoring. PTSD symptom clusters were associated with AHR. Symptom clusters and lifetime victimization severity jointly predicted ABP, with ABP the highest among severely victimized women with high levels of current intrusions. Given the prevalence of criminal victimization, biopsychosocial research on women's cardiovascular disease risk may benefit from increased attention to this stressor and its psychological sequelae. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Five days of integrative body-mind training (IBMT) improves attention and self-regulation in comparison with the same amount of relaxation training. This paper explores the underlying mechanisms of this finding. We measured the physiological and brain changes at rest before, during, and after 5 days of IBMT and relaxation training. During and after training, the IBMT group showed significantly better physiological reactions in heart rate, respiratory amplitude and rate, and skin conductance response (SCR) than the relaxation control. Differences in heart rate variability (HRV) and EEG power suggested greater involvement of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in the IBMT group during and after training. Imaging data demonstrated stronger subgenual and adjacent ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity in the IBMT group. Frontal midline ACC theta was correlated with high-frequency HRV, suggesting control by the ACC over parasympathetic activity. These results indicate that after 5 days of training, the IBMT group shows better regulation of the ANS by a ventral midfrontal brain system than does the relaxation group. This changed state probably reflects training in the coordination of body and mind given in the IBMT but not in the control group. These results could be useful in the design of further specific interventions.},

abstract = {According to classical concepts of physiologic control, healthy systems are self-regulated to reduce variability and maintain physiologic constancy. Contrary to the predictions of homeostasis, however, the output of a wide variety of systems, such as the normal human heartbeat, fluctuates in a complex manner, even under resting conditions. Scaling techniques adapted from statistical physics reveal the presence of long-range, power-law correlations, as part of multifractal cascades operating over a wide range of time scales. These scaling properties suggest that the nonlinear regulatory systems are operating far from equilibrium, and that maintaining constancy is not the goal of physiologic control. In contrast, for subjects at high risk of sudden death (including those with heart failure), fractal organization, along with certain nonlinear interactions, breaks down. Application of fractal analysis may provide new approaches to assessing cardiac risk and forecasting sudden cardiac death, as well as to monitoring the aging process. Similar approaches show promise in assessing other regulatory systems, such as human gait control in health and disease. Elucidating the fractal and nonlinear mechanisms involved in physiologic control and complex signaling networks is emerging as a major challenge in the postgenomic era.},

abstract = {Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prolonged reaction to an extremely traumatic experience. One of the core symptoms of PTSD is hyper-arousal which can be the result of an elevated activation of the autonomic nervous system. Including psychophysiological assessment methods in PTSD research can point to the neurobiological bases of the disorder. The studies of psychophysiology of PTSD to date have mostly measured reactivity. The aim of the current study was to compare resting state psychophysiology and startle reflexes in PTSD patients and controls in a sample of Croatian combat veterans. We measured heart-rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, skin conductance, and eyeblink muscle contraction during an acclimation period and during the presentation of startle stimuli in 45 male PTSD patients and 33 male healthy controls. We found that PTSD patient had elevated baseline heart-rate and decreased respiratory sinus arrhythmia compared to the controls. Furthermore, PTSD patients had impaired habituation to the startle probe, but there was no group difference in initial startle magnitude. There was also no group difference in skin conductance level or skin conductance response. Startle habituation and baseline heart-rate appear to offer the most reliable psychophysiological indices of PTSD. This finding replicates trends in the literature in a new population of PTSD patients. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Cardiovascular (CV) mortality and combined sudden death + implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) discharge were assessed as a function of continuous variables in the entire population and in patients with LVEF {\textgreater}30{\%} in univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. After a median of 47 months, 57 patients died of CV causes and 47 experienced the arrhythmic endpoint. For CV mortality, VLFP, LFP, and turbulence slope (TS) improved predictive discrimination (c-index) and risk classification [integrated discrimination improvement (IDI)] when added to clinical variables [age {\textgreater}=70 years, LVEF, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), serum creatinine], while for arrhythmic mortality although the c-index increased in all three autonomic markers, the results of the IDI were statistically significant only for TS when added to NSVT, serum creatinine, and ischaemic aetiology. In 194 patients with LVEF {\textgreater}30{\%} (20 arrhythmic events), the hazard ratio of an impaired TS ({\textless}2.5 msper RR interval) was 3.81 (95{\%} confidence interval 1.35-10.7,P = 0.012) after adjustment for serum creatinine.Conclusions Autonomic indexes still have independent predictive value on long-term outcome in HF patients.

BACKGROUND: Several risk variables have been suggested to predict the occurrence of sudden cardiac death (SCD), but the utility of these variables has not been well established among patients using medical therapy according to contemporary guidelines. METHODS: A consecutive series of 700 patients with AMI was studied. The end points were total mortality, SCD, and nonsudden cardiac death (non-SCD). Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (nsVT), ejection fraction (EF), heart rate variability, baroreflex sensitivity, signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG), QT dispersion, and QRS duration were analyzed (n = 675). Beta-blocking therapy was used by 97{\%} of the patients at discharge and by 95{\%} at one and two years after AMI. RESULTS: During a mean (±SD) follow-up of 43 ± 15 months, 37 non-SCDs (5.5{\%}) and 22 SCDs (3.2{\%}) occurred. All arrhythmia risk variables differed between the survivors and those with non-SCD (e.g., the standard deviation of N-N intervals was 98 ± 32 vs. 74 ± 21 ms [p {\textless} 0.001] and the QRS duration was 103 ± 22 vs.89 ± 16 ms [p {\textless} 0.001]). Sudden cardiac death was weakly predicted only by reduced EF ({\textless}0. 40; p {\textless} 0.05), nsVT (p {\textless} 0.05), and abnormal SAECG (p {\textless} 0.05), but not by autonomic markers or standard ECG variables. The positive predictive accuracy of EF, nsVT, and abnormal SAECG as predictors of SCD was relatively low (8{\%}, 12{\%}, and 13{\%}, respectively).

abstract = {In general, the results of psychophysiologic research on PTSD support the presence of a variety of autonomic, sensory, and cognitive processing differences between individuals with and without the disorder. The findings are diverse and include heightened responsiveness to trauma reminders; exaggerated startle; increased conditionability and autonomic responsiveness to aversive, high-intensity stimuli; and elevated tonic or baseline physiologic activity. Increased sensitivity of the central nervous system is suggested by electrophysiologic evidence for a failure to habituate to redundant information, over-responsiveness to novel information, and reduced cortical responsiveness to overstimulation. Cognitive processing abnormalities are suggested by electrophysiologic evidence for a reduced ability to attend to task-relevant information and increased attention to task-irrelevant, trauma-related information in individuals with PTSD. Some findings, such as the heightened physiologic and P300 response amplitude responses to trauma-related stimuli and increased HR response to loud tones, have been highly replicable and appear to be as reliable as any biologic finding in the psychiatric literature. Other findings, such as increased eye-blink startle responses and tonic or baseline physiologic activity, have been less consistently replicated and have led investigators to explore how stressful or threatening experimental contexts might produce phasic alterations in the psychophysiology of individuals with PTSD. We hope that the broad range of psychophysiologic investigations and findings in PTSD will inspire others to consider possible applications of these methodologies to their own clinical and research endeavors. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Abstract CONTEXT: Major depressive disorder (MDD) associated with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) increases the risk of mortality. Decreased heart rate variability (HRV), also a predictor of mortality, is reduced in patients with MDD after ACS, and has been suggested to be a mediator of MDD mortality after ACS. Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may reduce mortality post-ACS, little is known about their effects on HRV. OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of both sertraline and improvement in mood on HRV. METHODS: The Sertraline Antidepressant Heart Attack Randomized Trial assessed HRV from 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram recordings at baseline in 290 patients and from a second recording in 258 of these patients 16 weeks after randomization to sertraline or placebo. Frequency domain measures of HRV included high-frequency power, low-frequency power, very low-frequency power, ultra low-frequency power, and total power. Depression severity was measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Clinical response was measured with the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement scale. RESULTS: At baseline, prior episodes of MDD were associated with lower HRV. Sertraline significantly increased ultra low-frequency power, while improvement in mood was associated with higher low-frequency power independent of treatment. However, the expected recovery in HRV following ACS was not observed in patients with MDD. Higher ultra low-frequency during sertraline treatment and higher low-frequency power in patients whose mood improved resulted primarily from these measures decreasing in their comparison groups. CONCLUSIONS: Heart rate variability recovery is impaired in depressed patients after ACS. Previously reported differences in baseline HRV between patients with and without depression after ACS grew larger in the 16 weeks following a coronary event. Both sertraline treatment and symptomatic recovery from depression were associated with increased HRV compared with placebo-treated and nonrecovered post-ACS control groups, respectively, but this results primarily from decreased HRV in the comparison groups.Publication Type Comparative Study.

abstract = {To clarify the influence of gender on sympathetic and parasympathetic control of heart rate in middle-aged subjects and on the subsequent aging process, heart rate variability (HRV) was studied in normal populations of women (n = 598) and men (n = 472) ranging in age from 40 to 79 yr. These groups were divided into eight age strata at 5-yr intervals and were clinically diagnosed as having no hypertension, hypotension, diabetic neuropathy, or cardiac arrhythmia. Frequency-domain analysis of short-term, stationary R-R intervals was performed, which reveals very-low-frequency power (VLF; 0.003-0.04 Hz), low-frequency power (LF; 0.04-0.15 Hz), high-frequency power (HF; 0.15-0.40 Hz), the ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF), and LF and HF power in normalized units (LF{\%} and HF{\%}, respectively). The distribution of variance, VLF, LF, HF, and LF/HF exhibited acute skewness, which was adjusted by natural logarithmic transformation. Women had higher HF in the age strata from 40 to 49 yr, whereas men had higher LF{\%} and LF/HF between 40 and 59 yr. No disparity in HRV measurements was found between the sexes in age strata {\textgreater}/=60 yr. Although absolute measurements of HRV (variance, VLF, LF, and HF) decreased linearly with age, no significant change in relative measurements (LF/HF, LF{\%}, and HF{\%}), especially in men, was detected until age 60 yr. We conclude that middle-aged women and men have a more dominant parasympathetic and sympathetic regulation of heart rate, respectively. The gender-related difference in parasympathetic regulation diminishes after age 50 yr, whereas a significant time delay for the disappearance of sympathetic dominance occurs in men.},

abstract = {The objectives of this review are to discuss the diversity of mechanisms that may explain the association between heart rate (HR) variability and mortality, to appraise the clinical applicability of traditional and new measures of HR variability and to propose future directions in this field of research. There is a large body of data demonstrating that abnormal HR variability measured over a 24-h period provides information on the risk of subsequent death in subjects with and without structural heart disease. However, the mechanisms responsible for this association are not completely established. Therefore, no specific therapy is currently available to improve the prognosis for patients with abnormal HR variability. Reduced HR variability has been most commonly associated with a risk of arrhythmic death, but recent data suggest that abnormal variability also predicts vascular causes of death, progression of coronary atherosclerosis and death due to heart failure. A consensus is also lacking on the best HR variability measure for clinical purposes. Time and frequency domain measures of HR variability have been most commonly used, but recent studies show that new analysis methods based on nonlinear dynamics may be more powerful in terms of risk stratification. Before the measurement of HR variability can be applied to clinical practice and used to direct therapy, more precise insight into the pathophysiological link between HR variability and mortality are needed. Further studies should also address the issue of which of the HR variability indexes, including the new nonlinear measures, is best for clinical purposes in various patient populations.},

A total of 28 patients from the HAWAI registries (phase I and II), having medical records, who had experienced documented, verified VTA during the 2-year follow-up, were included in our analysis. HRV during preepisode recordings of 4,500 R-R intervals were analyzed using the Dyx parameter and compared to HRV of similar length recordings from the same patients that were not followed by arrhythmia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Our study population consisted mainly of men 25 of 28 (89{\%}), average age of 64.8 ± 9.4 years, 92{\%} with coronary artery disease. HRV during 64 preevent recordings (2.3 events per patient on average) was analyzed and compared with 60 control recordings. The multipole method of HRV analysis showed 50{\%} sensitivity and 91.6{\%} specificity for prediction of ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation in the study population, with 84.5{\%} positive predictive value. No statistically significant correlation was found between various clinical parameters and the sensitivity of imminent VTA predetection in our patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The multipole method of HRV analysis emerges as a highly specific, possible predictor of imminent VTA, providing an early warning allowing to prepare for an arrhythmic episode.},

abstract = {Background: Studies have linked depression to sudden death and serious cardiovascular events in patients with preexisting cardiac illness. Recent studies have shown decreased vagal function in cardiac patients with depression and depressed patients without cardiac illness. Methods: We compared 20-hour, sleeping, and awake heart period variability measures using spectral analysis, fractal dimension, and symbolic dynamics in two patient groups with major depression and ischemic heart disease (mean age 59-60 years) before and after 6 weeks of paroxetine or nortriptyline treatment. Results: Spectral measures showed decreases in awake and sleeping total power (TP: 0.0-0.5 Hz), ultra low frequency power (ULF: 0-0.0033 Hz), very low frequency power (VLF: 0.0033-0.04 Hz), and low-frequency power (LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz) for nortriptyline condition and a decrease in high-frequency power (HF: 0.15-0.5 Hz) for the awake condition in patients who received nortriptyline. A measure of nonlinear complexity, WC-100, significantly increased after paroxetine during the awake condition. Conclusions: These findings suggest that nortriptyline has stronger vagolytic effects on cardiac autonomic function compared with paroxetine, which is in agreement with previous clinical and preclinical reports. Paroxetine may have some cardio-protective effects, especially in cardiac patients.},

abstract = {Background Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent in the general population and US veterans in particular and is associated with an increased risk of developing coronary artery disease (CAD). We compared the patient characteristics and postprocedural outcomes of veterans with and without PTSD undergoing coronary angiography. Methods This is a multicenter observational study of patients who underwent coronary angiography in Veterans Affairs hospitals nationally from October 2007 to September 2011. We described patient characteristics at angiography, angiographic results, and after coronary angiography, we compared risk-adjusted 1-year rates of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), and revascularization by the presence or absence of PTSD. Results Overall, of 116,488 patients undergoing angiography, 14,918 (12.8{\%}) had PTSD. Compared with those without PTSD, patients with PTSD were younger (median age 61.9 vs 63.7; P {\textless}.001), had higher rates of cardiovascular risk factors, and were more likely to have had a prior MI (26.4{\%} vs 24.7{\%}; P {\textless}.001). Patients with PTSD were more likely to present for stable angina (22.4{\%} vs 17.0{\%}) or atypical chest pain (58.5{\%} vs 48.6{\%}) and less likely to have obstructive CAD identified at angiography (55.9{\%} vs 62.2{\%}; P {\textless}.001). After coronary angiography, PTSD was associated with lower unadjusted 1-year rates of MI (hazard ratio (HR), 0.86; 95{\%} CI [0.75-1.00]; P = 0.04), revascularization (HR, 0.88; 95{\%} CI [0.83-0.93]; P {\textless}.001), and all-cause mortality (HR, 0.66; 95{\%} CI [0.60-0.71]; P {\textless}.001). After adjustment for cardiovascular risk, PTSD was no longer associated with 1-year rates of MI or revascularization but remained associated with lower 1-year all-cause mortality (HR, 0.91; 95{\%} CI [0.84-0.99]; P =.03). Findings were similar after further adjustment for depression, anxiety, alcohol or substance use disorders, and frequency of outpatient follow-up. Conclusions Among veterans undergoing coronary angiography in the Veterans Affairs, those with PTSD were more likely to present with elective indications and less likely to have obstructive CAD. After coronary angiography, PTSD was not associated with adverse 1-year outcomes of MI, revascularization, or all-cause mortality. {\textcopyright} 2014 Mosby, Inc.},

@article{Woody2014,
abstract = {There is growing evidence that rumination, perhaps specifically brooding rumination, is a core feature of depression and that it contributes to the development and maintenance of the disorder. A separate line of research has highlighted the role played by heart rate variability (HRV). Both brooding rumination and HRV appear to be driven by disruption in the same neural circuit, heightened amygdala reactivity combined with decreased prefrontal control, and both are highlighted in different units of analysis as reflecting the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) construct of Loss. However, little is known about the relation among these variables. In the current study, we predicted that higher levels of brooding rumination would be associated with lower levels of HRV and that women at high risk for future depression (i.e., those with a history of past major depressive disorder [MDD]) would exhibit higher levels of brooding and lower levels of HRV. We also examined genetic influences on the variables in this model. We predicted that COMT Val158Met genotype, which has been linked to heightened amygdala reactivity and deficits in prefrontal functioning, would be associated with brooding rumination and HRV, particularly among women with a history of past MDD. The results largely supported our hypotheses, providing additional support for relations among the different units of analysis for the Loss construct.},

abstract = {The relationship between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and high frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) was investigated during a resting baseline period and two 4-minute laboratory speech tasks. Participants were 20 women with PTSD and 20 age- and gender-matched controls. Parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) cardiac control was measured as HF-HRV (0.12-0.40 Hz) using power spectrum analysis. Participants with PTSD had significantly greater reductions in HF-HRV during two speech tasks (trauma recall and mental arithmetic) than control. These results suggest that PTSD is related to the magnitude of decrease in parasympathetic cardiac control during stress in women. Health implications of altered PNS activity associated with PTSD deserve further study. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Serotonin (5-HT) is crucial to normal reflex vagal modulation of heart rate (HR). Reduced baroreflex sensitivity [spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (sBRS)] and HR variability (HRV) reflect impaired neural, particularly vagal, control of HR and are independently associated with depression. In conscious, telemetered Flinders-Sensitive Line (FSL) rats, a well-validated animal model of depression, we tested the hypothesis that cardiovascular regulatory abnormalities are present and associated with deficient serotonergic control of reflex cardiovagal function. In FSL rats and control Flinders-Resistant (FRL) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat strains, diurnal measurements of HR, arterial pressure (AP), activity, sBRS, and HRV were made. All strains had normal and similar diurnal variations in HR, AP, and activity. In FRL rats, HR was elevated, contributing to the reduced HRV and sBRS in this strain. In FSL rats, sBRS and high-frequency power HRV were reduced during the night, indicating reduced reflex cardiovagal activity. The ratio of low- to high-frequency bands of HRV was increased in FSL rats, suggesting a relative predominance of cardiac sympathetic and/or reflex activity compared with FRL and SD rats. These data show that conscious FSL rats have cardiovascular regulatory abnormalities similar to depressed humans. Acute changes in HR, AP, temperature, and sBRS in response to 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, a 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1B), and 5-HT(7) receptor agonist, were also determined. In FSL rats, despite inducing an exaggerated hypothermic effect, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin did not decrease HR and AP or improve sBRS, suggesting impaired serotonergic neural control of cardiovagal activity. These data suggest that impaired serotonergic control of cardiac reflex function could be one mechanism linking reduced sBRS to increased cardiac risk in depression.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine in a nonclinical sample of preadolescents the possibility that somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms are differentially related with the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Depression is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Dysregulation of the ANS and the HPA axis have been proposed as underlying mechanisms. Several studies suggest that only a subset of the depression symptoms account for associations with cardiovascular prognosis. METHODS: Self-reported somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms were examined in relationship to heart rate variability (HRV), spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), and the cortisol awakening response (CAR) in 2049 preadolescents (mean age = 11.1 years; 50.7{\%} = girls) from the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS). RESULTS: Physiological measurements were not associated with the overall measure of depressive symptoms. Somatic depressive symptoms were negatively related to HRV and BRS, and positively to the CAR; cognitive-affective depressive symptoms were positively related to HRV and BRS, and negatively to the CAR. Associations with the CAR pertained to boys only. CONCLUSIONS: Somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms differ in their association with both cardiac autonomic and HPA axis function in preadolescents. Particularly, somatic depression symptoms may mark cardiac risk.},

abstract = {Background--Patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) have a continuing high mortality. Autonomic dysfunction may play an important role in the pathophysiology of cardiac death in CHF. UK-HEART examined the value of heart rate variability (HRV) measures as independent predictors of death in CHF. Methods and Results--In a prospective study powered for mortality, we recruited 433 outpatients 62{\{}+/-{\}}9.6 years old with CHF (NYHA functional class I to III; mean ejection fraction, 0.41{\{}+/-{\}}0.17). Time-domain HRV indices and conventional prognostic indicators were related to death by multivariate analysis. During 482{\{}+/-{\}}161 days of follow-up, cardiothoracic ratio, SDNN, left ventricular end-systolic diameter, and serum sodium were significant predictors of all-cause mortality. The risk ratio for a 41.2-ms decrease in SDNN was 1.62 (95{\%} CI, 1.16 to 2.44). The annual mortality rate for the study population in SDNN subgroups was 5.5{\%} for {\textgreater}100 ms, 12.7{\%} for 50 to 100 ms, and 51.4{\%} for {\textless}50 ms. SDNN, creatinine, and serum sodium were related to progressive heart failure death. Cardiothoracic ratio, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, the presence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and serum potassium were related to sudden cardiac death. A reduction in SDNN was the most powerful predictor of the risk of death due to progressive heart failure. Conclusions--CHF is associated with autonomic dysfunction, which can be quantified by measuring HRV. A reduction in SDNN identifies patients at high risk of death and is a better predictor of death due to progressive heart failure than other conventional clinical measurements. High-risk subgroups identified by this measurement are candidates for additional therapy after prescription of an ACE inhibitor.},

abstract = {Indices of heart rate variability (HRV) provide a window onto autonomic modulation of the heart. HRV indices, determined in either the time or frequency domain, are closely related and reflect parasympathetic, mixed sympathetic, and parasympathetic and circadian rhythms. In population studies, decreased HRV has had predictive value for mortality among healthy adults. It is a well-established risk factor for arrhythmic events and mortality among post-myocardial-infarction patients but has only moderate sensitivity and specificity. Decreased HRV has had mixed predictive success in congestive heart failure. Reduced HRV identifies diabetic patients with autonomic neuropathy. HRV in combination with other risk stratifiers, e.g. ejection fraction, can identify cardiac patients at especially high risk of mortality. Many but not all interventions associated with increased HRV are also associated with better survival rates.},

abstract = {Individual differences in the cardiovascular response to stress play a central role in the reactivity hypothesis linking frequent exposure to psychosocial stress to adverse outcomes in cardiovascular health. To assess the importance of genetic factors, a meta-analysis was performed on all published twin studies that assessed heart rate (HR) or blood pressure (BP) reactivity to the cold pressor test or various mental stress tasks. For reactivity to mental stress, the pooled heritability estimate ranged from 0.26 to 0.43. Reactivity to the cold pressor test yielded heritability estimates from 0.21 to 0.55. An ensuing review of genetic association studies revealed a number of genes, mostly within the sympathoadrenal pathway, that may account for part of the heritability of cardiovascular stress reactivity. Future progress in gene finding, that should include measures of sympathetic and vagal stress reactivity, may help uncover the molecular pathways from genetic variation to stress reactivity. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

A population-based sample of 71 men and 79 women (35-64 yrs of age) was studied. Five-minute supine recordings of ECG and beat-to-beat photoplethysmographic finger systolic arterial pressure and diastolic arterial pressure were obtained during paced breathing. Power spectra were computed using a fast Fourier transform for low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) powers. BRS was calculated by cross-spectral analysis of R-R interval and systolic arterial pressure variabilities. PFs were evaluated by 3 self-report questionnaires: the Brief Symptom Inventory, the shortened version of the Spielberger State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory, and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. PFs were not related to HRV. Anxiety was associated with decreased BRS and higher LF power of systolic arterial pressure variability. These associations were independent of age, gender, other psychological factors, heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Hostility was an independent correlate of increased LF power of diastolic arterial pressure and increased HF power of systolic arterial pressure variability.

High QT interval variability is a risk factor for arrhythmic events, including sudden cardiac death. The purpose of this study was to determine whether depression is associated with increased QT variability in patients recovering from myocardial infarction. METHODS: Twenty patients with major depression recovering from a recent myocardial infarction were matched with 20 nondepressed post-myocardial infarction patients on age and sex, and all underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring. RESULTS: There were no differences between groups on average heart rate, heart rate variability, or other electrocardiographic measures. However, the QT interval showed significantly greater variability in the depressed than in the nondepressed group, especially at midnight and at 6:00 AM. CONCLUSIONS: Depressed post-myocardial infarction patients may be at greater risk for sudden cardiac death as a result of abnormalities in ventricular repolarization. More work is needed to determine the clinical and prognostic significance of QT variability in these patients.},

abstract = {Background: Depression is associated with an increased risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation, proinflammatory processes, and procoagulant processes have been suggested as possible explanations. Methods: Heart rate variability (HRV), an indicator of cardiac autonomic regulation, and markers of inflammation [C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$)] and coagulation (fibrinogen) were assessed in 44 depressed patients with CHD. Results: Moderate, negative correlations were found between fibrinogen and four measures of HRV. IL-6 also negatively correlated with one measure of HRV (total power) and was marginally related to two others (very low frequency and low frequency power). Neither CRP nor TNF-$\alpha$ was significantly related to any measure of HRV. Conclusions: The finding that fibrinogen and IL-6 are moderately related to HRV suggests a link between these factors in depressed CHD patients. The relationship between ANS function and inflammatory and coagulant processes should be investigated in larger mechanistic studies of depression and cardiac morbidity and mortality. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Rationale: We validated heart rate (HR) and six time and six frequency domain measures of heart rate variability (HRV) as estimators of autonomic outflow in 44 young healthy male subjects. Gold standards for autonomic outflow were the Rosenblueth-Simeone factors m (sympathetic tone) and n (vagal tone), and the sympathovagal balance m{\textperiodcentered}n, determined by two-stage complete autonomic blockade. Methods: Rank correlations were computed between HR and the HRV measures obtained before autonomic blockade, and m, n and m{\textperiodcentered}n. Also, the maximal mean performances (averaged sensitivity and specificity) for HR and HRV as discriminators between low and high values of m, n or m{\textperiodcentered}n were computed. Results: The spectral HRV measures showed less good correlations and performances than the time domain HRV measures. Correlations with sympathetic tone were all below 0.31. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia during 15 cycles/min metronome breathing was superior in estimating vagal tone and sympathovagal balance (correlations -0.71/-0.73; both performances 0.82), heart rate scored similarly for assessing the sympathovagal balance (correlation 0.71; performance 0.82). Conclusions: It does not appear justified to evaluate HR or HRV in terms of sympathetic tone, vagal tone, or sympathovagal balance. HR and HRV are specifically weak in assessing sympathetic tone. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia during 15 cycles/min metronome breathing is superior in assessing vagal tone. Current HRV analysis techniques offer no advantages compared with HR in assessing the sympathovagal balance.},

Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) has been suggested as a possible explanation for this association. The purpose of this study was to determine if depression is associated with reduced HRV in patients with a recent MI. METHODS AND RESULTS Three hundred eighty acute MI patients with depression and 424 acute MI patients without depression were recruited. All underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring after hospital discharge. In univariate analyses, 4 indices of HRV were significantly lower in patients with depression than in patients without depression. Variables associated with HRV were then compared between patients with and without depression, and potential confounds were identified. These variables (age, sex, diabetes, and present cigarette smoking) were entered into an analysis of covariance model, followed by depression status. In the final model, all but one HRV index (high-frequency power) remained significantly lower in patients with depression than in patients without depression. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that greater autonomic dysfunction, as reflected by decreased HRV, is a plausible mechanism linking depression to increased cardiac mortality in post-MI patients.},

abstract = {Background: Depression is associated with an increased risk for mortality after acute myocardial infarction (MI). The purpose of this study was to determine whether low heart rate variability (HRV) mediates the effect of depression on mortality. Methods: Twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were obtained from 311 depressed patients with a recent acute MI who were enrolled in the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease (ENRICHD) clinical trial and from 367 nondepressed patients who met the ENRICHD medical inclusion criteria. Standard HRV indexes were extracted from the recordings. Results: The log of very low-frequency (LnVLF) power, an index of HRV derived from power spectral analysis of the electrocardiogram signal (0.0033-0.04 Hz [in milliseconds squared]), was lower in the depressed than in the nondepressed patients (P{\textless}.001). There were 47 deaths (6.1{\%}) during a 30-month follow-up. After adjusting for potential confounders, the depressed patients remained at higher risk for all-cause mortality compared with the nondepressed patients (hazard ratio, 2.8; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.4-5.4; P{\textless}.003). When LnVLF power was entered into the model, the hazard ratio for depression dropped to 2.1 (95{\%} CI, 1.1-4.2; P=.03). The proportion of the risk for depression attributable to LnVLF power was 0.27 (95{\%} CI, 0.23-0.31; P{\textless}.001). Conclusions: Low HRV partially mediates the effect of depression on survival after acute MI. This finding helps to clarify the physiological mechanisms underlying depression's role as a risk factor for mortality in patients with coronary heart disease. It also raises the possibility that treatments that improve both depression and HRV might also improve survival in these patients. {\textcopyright}2005 American Medical Association.

@article{Seals1991,
abstract = {Recent investigations using direct (microneurographic) recordings of MSNA have provided a substantial amount of new information on the regulation of sympathetic nervous system control of nonactive skeletal muscle blood flow during exercise in humans. Some of the new conclusions from these studies discussed in this review include: 1. The direction, pattern and magnitude of the MSNA response to exercise depend on the collective influence of a number of factors, including the mode (isometric or rhythmic), intensity, and duration of the exercise, the size of the contracting muscle mass, and possibly the level of conditioning (physical training) of the exercising muscles. The MSNA response also appears to be tightly coupled with the onset and progression of muscle fatigue, at least during sustained, isometric contractions. 2. Increases in MSNA evoked during exercise with the arms are fairly uniform among different skeletal muscle nerves, and these responses correlate strongly with changes in venous plasma norepinephrine concentrations, limb vascular resistance and arterial blood pressure. Thus, increases in this neural activity during exercise are associated with the expected physiological responses. 3. The MSNA response to the same level of exercise varies markedly among healthy subjects but appears to be consistent over time within a particular subject. 4. The muscle metaboreflex (muscle chemoreflex) is the primary-mechanism by which MSNA is stimulated during small-muscle, isometric exercise in humans. In contrast, central command has a relatively weak influence on MSNA during this type of exercise. 5. Muscle metaboreflex-stimulation of MSNA also occurs during dynamic exercise, but only at or above moderate, submaximal intensities (i.e., not during mild exercise). 6. Muscle metaboreflex-evoked increases in MSNA during exercise are strongly associated with glycogenolysis and the consequent cellular accumulation of hydrogen ions in the contracting muscles. 7. Sympathoinhibitory cardiopulmonary reflexes do not appear to modulate the MSNA responses to isometric exercise in the healthy human. However, arterial baroreflexes exert a potent inhibitory effect on MSNA during this form of exercise. The mechanisms involved in the regulation of MSNA during large-muscle, dynamic leg exercise is an important topic for future investigations, as is the relationship between MSNA and sympathetic outflow to other regional circulations (e.g., heart, viscera, skin) during various forms of exercise.},

We tested whether men and women (aged 45 to 64 years) from the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities study (n=8185) with ANS dysfunction, estimated by high heart rate (HR) and low HR variability (HRV), were at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Supine HR and HRV indices were measured for 2 minutes at baseline; indices were divided into quartiles for analyses. From 1987 to 1998 (mean follow-up 8.3 years), there were 1063 cases of incident diabetes. The relative risk (RR) of developing diabetes for participants with low-frequency (LF) power (0.04 to 0.15 Hz) HRV in the lowest quartile ({\textless}7.7 ms2) compared with the highest quartile ({\textgreater} or =38.9 ms2) was 1.2 (95{\%} CI 1.0-1.4) after adjustment for age, race, sex, study center, education, alcohol drinking, current smoking, prevalent coronary heart disease, physical activity, and body mass index. Participants in the uppermost ({\textgreater}72.7 bpm) versus the lowest ({\textless} or =60.1 bpm) quartile of HR had a 60{\%} increased risk (95{\%} CI 33{\%}-92{\%}) of developing diabetes. Results were similar when the sample was restricted to participants with normal fasting glucose (glucose {\textless}6.1 mmol/L) at baseline (n=7192) or when adjusted for baseline glucose (HR quartile 4 versus quartile 1, RR=1.4, 95{\%} CI 1.2-1.7). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that ANS dysfunction may be associated with the development of diabetes in healthy adults.},

abstract = {The alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine reduces blood pressure more effectively in White than Black Americans despite similar degrees of sympatholysis. Functional genetic variation in receptor signaling mechanisms, for example in the beta 3 G-protein subunit (GNB3 C825T) and in the alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor subtype (ADRA2C del322-325), may affect drug responses. We examined the hypothesis that there are ethnic differences in the responses to the highly selective alpha(2)-agonist, dexmedetomidine, and that these genetic variants contribute to interindividual variability in drug responses. In a placebo-controlled, single-masked study, 73 healthy subjects (37 whites and 36 blacks) received 3 placebo infusions and then 3 incremental doses of dexmedetomidine (cumulative dose, 0.4 microg/kg), each separated by 30 minutes. Blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma catecholamine concentrations were determined after each infusion. We measured dexmedetomidine concentrations after the last infusion and determined ADRA2C del322-325 and GNB3 C825T genotypes. Dexmedetomidine lowered blood pressure and plasma catecholamine concentrations significantly (all P{\textless}0.001). There was substantial interindividual variability in the reduction of systolic blood pressure (range, 1 to 34 mm Hg) and plasma norepinephrine concentrations (range, 24 to 424 pg/mL). However, there were no differences between black and white subjects in dexmedetomidine responses (P{\textgreater}0.16 for all outcomes) before or after adjustment for covariates. Neither ADRA2C del322-325 nor GNB3 C825T genotypes affected the responses to dexmedetomidine (all P{\textgreater}0.66). There is large interindividual variability in response to the selective alpha(2)-AR agonist dexmedetomidine, and neither ethnicity nor ADRA2C and GNB3 genotypes contribute to it. Further studies to identify determinants of alpha(2)-AR-mediated responses will be of interest.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Depression is a risk factor for mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), possibly as a result of altered autonomic nervous system (ANS) modulation of heart rate (HR) and rhythm. The purposes of this study were to determine: a) whether depressed patients are more likely to have an abnormal HR response (i.e., abnormal turbulence) to premature ventricular contractions (VPCs), and b) whether abnormal HR turbulence accounts for the effect of depression on increased mortality after AMI. METHODS Ambulatory electrocardiographic data were obtained from 666 (316 depressed, 350 nondepressed) patients with a recent AMI; 498 had VPCs with measurable HR turbulence. Of these, 260 had normal, 152 had equivocal, and 86 had abnormal HR turbulence. Patients were followed for up to 30 (median = 24) months. RESULTS Depressed patients were more likely to have abnormal HR turbulence (risk factor adjusted odds ratio = 1.8; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.0-3.0; p = .03) and have worse survival (odds ratio = 2.4; 95{\%} CI = 1.2-4.6; p = .02) than nondepressed patients. When HR turbulence was added to the model, the adjusted hazard ratio for depression decreased to 1.9 (95{\%} CI = 0.9-3.8; p = .08), and to 1.6 (95{\%} CI = 0.8-3.4; p = .18) when a measure of HR variability (LnVLF) was added. The hazard was found to differ over time with depression posing little risk for mortality in year 1 but greater risk in years 2 and 3 of the follow up. CONCLUSION ANS dysregulation may partially mediate the increased risk for mortality in depressed patients with frequent VPCs after an AMI.},

abstract = {Previous cross-sectional studies have shown that heart rate (HR) and HR variability (HRV) are influenced by several behavioral, biologic, and psychosocial factors. There are very few longitudinal studies that enable analyses of changes in HRV over time at an individual level. This study aimed to describe changes in HR and HRV in a general population setting and to determine predictors of HR and HRV at follow-up. From 1997 to 2004, 1,999 participants (29{\%} women) in the United Kingdom Whitehall II Cohort Study had 2 measurements of cardiac autonomic function (mean time between measurements 5.47 years, range 4.07 to 6.93). The mean ± SD age at the first measurement was 55.6 ± 6.0 years. At baseline, men showed higher low-frequency power than women, suggesting that they may have higher sympathetic activity. Conversely, women had higher high-frequency power, indicating higher parasympathetic tone. Over the 5-year follow-up period, men and women had decreases in HR. Men had reductions in HRV in time and frequency dimensions, whereas women showed increases in HRV. In conclusion, the probability of being in the adverse quartile of HRV function and HR at follow-up was related to baseline exercise, body mass index, cholesterol, and blood pressure. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Cardiovascular (CV) mortality and combined sudden death + implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) discharge were assessed as a function of continuous variables in the entire population and in patients with LVEF {\textgreater}30{\%} in univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. After a median of 47 months, 57 patients died of CV causes and 47 experienced the arrhythmic endpoint. For CV mortality, VLFP, LFP, and turbulence slope (TS) improved predictive discrimination (c-index) and risk classification [integrated discrimination improvement (IDI)] when added to clinical variables [age {\textgreater}=70 years, LVEF, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), serum creatinine], while for arrhythmic mortality although the c-index increased in all three autonomic markers, the results of the IDI were statistically significant only for TS when added to NSVT, serum creatinine, and ischaemic aetiology. In 194 patients with LVEF {\textgreater}30{\%} (20 arrhythmic events), the hazard ratio of an impaired TS ({\textless}2.5 msper RR interval) was 3.81 (95{\%} confidence interval 1.35-10.7,P = 0.012) after adjustment for serum creatinine.Conclusions Autonomic indexes still have independent predictive value on long-term outcome in HF patients.

abstract = {We report a novel approach to the determination of sleep apnea based on measuring the peripheral circulatory responses in a primary condition of disordered breathing. The apparatus is a finger plethysmograph coupled to a constant volume, variable pressure, pneumatic system. The plethysmograph's tip (measurement site) is composed of two parallel opposing longitudinal half thimbles, which is attached to a contiguous annular cuff. Each compartment consists of an internal membrane surrounded by an outer rigid wall. These provide a uniform pressure field and impart a two-point locking action preventing axial and longitudinal motion of the finger. Subdiastolic pressure is applied to prevent venous pooling, engorgement, and stasis, to inhibit retrograde venous shock wave propagation and partially unload arterial wall tension. The annular cuff extends the effective boundary of the pressure field beyond the measuring site. In 42 patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) profound, transient vasoconstriction and tachycardia usually of a periodic nature, were clearly seen with each apneic event, possibly related to transient arousal. Good agreement was found between standard total apnea-hypopnea scoring, 129.5+/-22.4 (Mean +/- SEM), and transient vasoconstriction and tachycardia events, 121.2+/-19.4 (R = .92, p{\textless}.0001). We conclude that the finger tip exemplifies the scope of peripheral vascular responsiveness due to its high density of alpha sympathetic innervation, and its high degree of blood flow rate lability. Given that elevated peripheral resistance and tightly linked transient heart rate elevation is a consistent part of the hemodynamic response to arousal and OSAS, we believe that pulsatile finger blood flow patterns can be clearly diagnostic of OSAS and other sleep-disordered breathing conditions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although heart rate variability (HRV) at 0.1 Hz has been proposed as a noninvasive clinical measure of cardiac sympathetic nerve firing, this premise has not been sufficiently validated by comparison with techniques such as microneurography and the measurement of norepinephrine spillover from the heart that more directly reflect presynaptic sympathetic activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared the three techniques under conditions of effective cardiac sympathetic denervation, pure autonomic failure (n = 4), dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency (n = 1), and after cardiac transplantation (n = 9) as well as in the context of sympathetic nervous activation in cardiac failure (n = 15) and with aging (n = 10). Age-matched comparisons were made in each case with healthy individuals drawn from a pool of 52 volunteers. In pure autonomic failure and early after transplantation, cardiac norepinephrine spillover was negligible, and HRV was low. Late after transplantation, however, cardiac norepinephrine spillover returned to normal levels, and HRV remained low. In comparison to younger subjects (18 to 35 years old), older individuals (60 to 75 years old) had higher muscle sympathetic nerve activity (young, 22.9 +/- 1.9; old, 31.3 +/- 5.8 bursts per minute; P {\textless} .05) and cardiac norepinephrine spillover (young, 14.3 +/- 2.5; old, 20.1 +/- 3.0 ng/min; P {\textless} .05). In contrast, total HRV was reduced by 89{\%}, and at 0.1 Hz it was reduced by 93{\%} (P {\textless} .05). Cardiac failure was also characterized by elevated cardiac norepinephrine spillover (cardiac failure patients, 59 +/- 4; healthy volunteers, 18 +/- 3 ng/min; P {\textless} .01) but reduced 0.1 Hz HRV (cardiac failure patients, 49 +/- 17; healthy volunteers, 243 +/- 4 ms2; P {\textless} .05). CONCLUSIONS: HRV at 0.1 Hz depends on factors in addition to cardiac sympathetic nerve firing rates, including multiple neural reflexes, cardiac adrenergic receptor sensitivity, postsynaptic signal transduction, and electrochemical coupling, and is not directly related to cardiac norepinephrine spillover, which is a more direct measure of the sympathetic nerve firing rate.},

abstract = {The accuracy of blood pressure values obtained by continuous noninvasive finger blood pressure recording via the FINAPRES device was evaluated by comparison with simultaneous intraarterial monitoring both at rest and during performance of tests known to induce fast and often marked changes in blood pressure. The comparison was performed in 24 normotensive or essential hypertensive subjects. The average discrepancy between finger and intra-arterial blood pressure recorded over a 30-minute rest period was 6.5 +/- 2.6 mm Hg and 5.4 +/- 2.9 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively; a close between-method correspondence was also demonstrated by linear regression analysis. The beat-to-beat changes in finger systolic and diastolic blood pressure were on average similar to those measured intra-arterially during tests that induced a pressor or depressor response (hand-grip, cold pressor test, diving test, Valsalva maneuver, intravenous injections of phenylephrine and trinitroglycerine) as well as during tests that caused vasomotor changes without major variations in blood pressure (application of lower body negative pressure, passive leg raising). The average between-method discrepancy in the evaluation of blood pressure changes was never greater than 4.3 and 2.0 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively; the corresponding standard deviations ranged between 4.6 and 1.6 mm Hg. Beat-to-beat computer analysis of blood pressure variability over the 30-minute rest period provided standard deviations almost identical when calculated by separate consideration of intra-arterial and finger blood pressure tracings (3.7 and 3.8 mm Hg, respectively).},

abstract = {Objectives The purpose of this study was to provide a meta-analysis to estimate the performance of 12 commonly reported risk stratification tests as predictors of arrhythmic events in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Background Multiple techniques have been assessed as predictors of death due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias/sudden death in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Methods Forty-five studies enrolling 6,088 patients evaluating the association between arrhythmic events and predictive tests (baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate turbulence, heart rate variability, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, left ventricular ejection fraction, electrophysiology study, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, left bundle branch block, signal-averaged electrocardiogram, fragmented QRS, QRS-T angle, and T-wave alternans) were included. Raw event rates were extracted, and meta-analysis was performed using mixed effects methodology. We also used the trim-and-fill method to estimate the influence of missing studies on the results. Results Patients were 52.8 ± 14.5 years of age, and 77{\%} were male. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 30.6 ± 11.4{\%}. Test sensitivities ranged from 28.8{\%} to 91.0{\%}, specificities from 36.2{\%} to 87.1{\%}, and odds ratios from 1.5 to 6.7. Odds ratio was highest for fragmented QRS and TWA (odds ratios: 6.73 and 4.66, 95{\%} confidence intervals: 3.85 to 11.76 and 2.55 to 8.53, respectively) and lowest for QRS duration (odds ratio: 1.51, 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.13 to 2.01). None of the autonomic tests (heart rate variability, heart rate turbulence, baroreflex sensitivity) were significant predictors of arrhythmic outcomes. Accounting for publication bias reduced the odds ratios for the various predictors but did not eliminate the predictive association. Conclusions Techniques incorporating functional parameters, depolarization abnormalities, repolarization abnormalities, and arrhythmic markers provide only modest risk stratification for sudden cardiac death in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. It is likely that combinations of tests will be required to optimize risk stratification in this population. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {Serotonin (5-HT) is crucial to normal reflex vagal modulation of heart rate (HR). Reduced baroreflex sensitivity [spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (sBRS)] and HR variability (HRV) reflect impaired neural, particularly vagal, control of HR and are independently associated with depression. In conscious, telemetered Flinders-Sensitive Line (FSL) rats, a well-validated animal model of depression, we tested the hypothesis that cardiovascular regulatory abnormalities are present and associated with deficient serotonergic control of reflex cardiovagal function. In FSL rats and control Flinders-Resistant (FRL) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat strains, diurnal measurements of HR, arterial pressure (AP), activity, sBRS, and HRV were made. All strains had normal and similar diurnal variations in HR, AP, and activity. In FRL rats, HR was elevated, contributing to the reduced HRV and sBRS in this strain. In FSL rats, sBRS and high-frequency power HRV were reduced during the night, indicating reduced reflex cardiovagal activity. The ratio of low- to high-frequency bands of HRV was increased in FSL rats, suggesting a relative predominance of cardiac sympathetic and/or reflex activity compared with FRL and SD rats. These data show that conscious FSL rats have cardiovascular regulatory abnormalities similar to depressed humans. Acute changes in HR, AP, temperature, and sBRS in response to 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, a 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1B), and 5-HT(7) receptor agonist, were also determined. In FSL rats, despite inducing an exaggerated hypothermic effect, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin did not decrease HR and AP or improve sBRS, suggesting impaired serotonergic neural control of cardiovagal activity. These data suggest that impaired serotonergic control of cardiac reflex function could be one mechanism linking reduced sBRS to increased cardiac risk in depression.},

abstract = {Five days of integrative body-mind training (IBMT) improves attention and self-regulation in comparison with the same amount of relaxation training. This paper explores the underlying mechanisms of this finding. We measured the physiological and brain changes at rest before, during, and after 5 days of IBMT and relaxation training. During and after training, the IBMT group showed significantly better physiological reactions in heart rate, respiratory amplitude and rate, and skin conductance response (SCR) than the relaxation control. Differences in heart rate variability (HRV) and EEG power suggested greater involvement of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in the IBMT group during and after training. Imaging data demonstrated stronger subgenual and adjacent ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity in the IBMT group. Frontal midline ACC theta was correlated with high-frequency HRV, suggesting control by the ACC over parasympathetic activity. These results indicate that after 5 days of training, the IBMT group shows better regulation of the ANS by a ventral midfrontal brain system than does the relaxation group. This changed state probably reflects training in the coordination of body and mind given in the IBMT but not in the control group. These results could be useful in the design of further specific interventions.},

abstract = {AIM: This research was designed to study the temporal changes in cardiovascular autonomic regulation, assessed by 24-hour heart rate (HR) variability, and the possible relation of changes in HR variability to cardiovascular risk factors and progression of coronary artery disease (CAD) among type II diabetic subjects. METHOD: In a single-center substudy of The Diabetes Atherosclerosis Intervention Study (DAIS), 53 patients assigned to fenofibrate (n = 26) or placebo (n = 27), underwent time and frequency domain and fractal analysis of HR variability, coronary risk variable analyses and quantitative coronary angiograms at baseline and after three years' follow-up. RESULTS: Twenty-four hour standard deviation of sinus intervals (SDNN) decreased from 113 +/- 35 to 94 +/- 30 msec (P {\textless} 0.001) during the three year period. Low frequency power spectral component and short-term fractal scaling exponent also decreased (P {\textless} 0.001 and P {\textless} 0.05, respectively). The reduction of SDNN was weakly related to a change in the triglyceride level (r = -0.33, P {\textless} 0.05), glucose level (r = -0.28, P {\textless} 0.05) and total cholesterol concentration (r = -0.35, P {\textless} 0.01). Furthermore, the reduction of SDNN was related to a decrease in the minimum lumen and mean segment diameter of the coronary arteries (r = 0.36, P {\textless} 0.01, and r = 0.39, P {\textless} 0.01, respectively). This association was more marked in the placebo group (r = 0.50, P {\textless} 0.01 and r = 0.44, P {\textless} 0.05, respectively) than among the patients randomized to fenofibrate (not significant for both). CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular autonomic regulation assessed by HR variability deteriorates rapidly in type II diabetic subjects with CAD during the time course. Impairment in HR variability is associated with changes in common coronary risk variables and with a progression of CAD.},

abstract = {According to classical concepts of physiologic control, healthy systems are self-regulated to reduce variability and maintain physiologic constancy. Contrary to the predictions of homeostasis, however, the output of a wide variety of systems, such as the normal human heartbeat, fluctuates in a complex manner, even under resting conditions. Scaling techniques adapted from statistical physics reveal the presence of long-range, power-law correlations, as part of multifractal cascades operating over a wide range of time scales. These scaling properties suggest that the nonlinear regulatory systems are operating far from equilibrium, and that maintaining constancy is not the goal of physiologic control. In contrast, for subjects at high risk of sudden death (including those with heart failure), fractal organization, along with certain nonlinear interactions, breaks down. Application of fractal analysis may provide new approaches to assessing cardiac risk and forecasting sudden cardiac death, as well as to monitoring the aging process. Similar approaches show promise in assessing other regulatory systems, such as human gait control in health and disease. Elucidating the fractal and nonlinear mechanisms involved in physiologic control and complex signaling networks is emerging as a major challenge in the postgenomic era.},

abstract = {Psychological depression is shown to be associated with several aspects of coronary artery disease (CAD), including arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, heart failure and sudden death. The physiological mechanisms accounting for this association are unclear. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal dysregulation, diminished heart rate variability, altered blood platelet function and noncompliance with medial treatments have been proposed as mechanisms underlying depression and cardiovascular disease. Recent evidence also suggests that reduced baroreflex sensitivity, impaired immune function, chronic fatigue and the co-morbidity of depression and anxiety may be involved in the relationship between depression and cardiovascular dysregulation. An experimental strategy using animal models for investigating underlying physiological abnormalities in depression is presented. A key to understanding the bidirectional association between depression and heart disease is to determine whether there are common changes in brain systems that are associated with these conditions. Such approaches may hold promise for advancing our understanding of the interaction between this mood disorder and CAD. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Identification of genetic factors that influence stress reactivity is important in order to link environmental demands, particularly adversity to disease outcome. There is ample literature on genetic contribution to the endocrine stress response, while evidence for genetic contribution to individual differences in autonomic nervous system function is sparse and produced conflicting results. Here, we investigated the influence of two polymorphisms in the Catechol-o-methyltransferase (. COMT) and serotonin transporter (. 5-HTT; . SCL6A4) gene. We examined the autonomic stress response to the Trier Social Stress Test for Children in 115 children. Salivary $\alpha$-amylase (sAA) was obtained prior to the stressor and repeatedly during recovery as a marker of autonomic reactivity. Furthermore, heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) were monitored continuously. We found differences in ANS stress response associated with each polymorphism (all . p{\textless}. .05). Children with the L variant of 5-HTTLPR showed a higher increase and sharper recovery of sAA in response to stress than those with S variants. For HR, we found differences associated with . COMT, i.e. children carrying at least one met allele showed lower mean HR increase and slower HR recovery in response to the stressor compared to those with two val alleles (. p{\textless}. .001) as well as a significant decrease in heart rate variability (. p{\textless}. .05). Our findings indicate that these two polymorphisms do indeed influence the ANS response to stress. This study provides further evidence for the crucial role of genetic factors in the modulation of differences in the acute stress response during childhood. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Information is limited about ECG predictors of the risk of incident congestive heart failure (CHF), particularly in women without overt manifestations of cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated hazard ratios for incident CHF and all-cause mortality using Cox regression in 38,283 participants of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) during a 9-year follow-up. All risk models were adjusted for demographic and available clinical and therapeutic variables (multivariable-adjusted models). A backward selection procedure was used to identify dominant predictors among those that were significant as individual ECG predictors. Eleven ECG variables were significant predictors of incident CHF, with none of them having a significant interaction with baseline CVD status. From 6 dominant ECG predictors, wide QRS/T angle had a nearly 3-fold increased risk in multivariable-adjusted single ECG variable models. Two other repolarization variables, STV5 depression and high TV1 amplitude, and 2 QRS-related variables, QRS non-dipolar voltage and myocardial infarction (MI) by ECG, were all associated with {\&}2-fold increase of incident CHF risk. Overall, 11 of the 12 ECG variables were significant predictors of all-cause mortality. Four variables had a significant interaction with CVD status requiring stratification. Three among these 4 were strong, dominant predictors in the CVD group: ECG MI, wide QRS/T angle, and low TV5 amplitude had risk increase from {\textgreater}2-fold to 3-fold, with considerably lower risks in the CVD-free group. CONCLUSIONS: Several repolarization variables in postmenopausal women are predictors of the risk of incident CHF and all-cause mortality as important as old ECG MI.},

abstract = {Depression is common in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and is a risk factor for cardiac morbidity and mortality in these patients. Depression is associated with autonomic nervous system dysfunction, which may at least partially explain this increased risk. Low heart rate variability (HRV), which reflects excessive sympathetic and/or inadequate parasympathetic modulation of heart rate, is a strong predictor of mortality in patients with CHD. Most studies-both in patients with stable CHD and in patients with a recent acute coronary event-have found HRV to be lower in depressed patients than in their nondepressed counterparts. This manuscript provides an overview of this literature and concludes that HRV may account for a substantial part of the risk associated with depression in CHD.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Major depression is a common problem in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and is associated with an increased risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality. It is not known whether treating depression will improve medical prognosis in patients with CHD. Depression is also associated with elevated heart rate and reduced heart rate variability (HRV), which are known risk factors for cardiac morbidity and mortality that may explain the increased risk associated with depression. The purpose of this study was to determine whether treatment for depression with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is associated with decreased heart rate or increased HRV. METHODS Thirty depressed patients with stable CHD, classified as either mildly or moderately to severely depressed, received up to 16 sessions of CBT. The 24-hour heart rate and HRV were measured in these patients and in 22 medically comparable nondepressed controls before and after treatment of the depressed patients. RESULTS Average heart rate and daytime rMSSD (reflecting mostly parasympathetic activity) improved significantly in the severely depressed patients, but remained unchanged in the mildly depressed and the control patients. However, only rMSSD improved to a level comparable to the control patients. None of the remaining indices of HRV showed improvement. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that treating depression with CBT may reduce heart rate and increase short-term HRV. Thus, CBT may have a beneficial effect on a risk factor for mortality in depressed patients with coronary heart disease. A randomized, controlled study is needed to confirm these findings.},

abstract = {Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been linked to increased morbidity. An inflexibility of the autonomic nervous system might be the underlying mechanism. We aimed to assess whether PTSD and combat trauma exposure are associated with lower heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function and a predictor of death. Methods: We measured HRV by power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram in 459 middle-aged veteran male twins. Combat trauma was assessed with the combat exposure scale, and current and remitted PTSD was assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders. Mixed-effects regression models were used to test associations of PTSD and HRV between and within twin pairs. Results: Of all twins, 211 had combat exposure, 31 had current PTSD, and 43 had remitted PTSD. Current PTSD was inversely associated with very-low-frequency and low-frequency HRV both in individual twins and within 20 pairs discordant for current PTSD. Twins with current PTSD had a 49{\%} lower low-frequency HRV than their brothers without PTSD (p{\textless}.001). Remitted PTSD was not associated with HRV. Results were robust to adjustment for depression and other risk factors. Combat exposure was inversely associated with most HRV frequencies, but this association mostly diminished after adjustment for current PTSD. Conclusion: In middle-aged veteran men, combat exposure and current PTSD are associated with measures of autonomic inflexibility previously shown to have prognostic significance. The negative health impact of combat exposure on autonomic function is mediated largely through PTSD and might reverse with remission of PTSD. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

Heart rate variability changes consistent with decreasing parasympa-thetic tone also were found to occur during either ISA, but to a significant degree, only during right ISA. Conclusions: The right hemisphere appears to have a greater role in cerebral regulation of cardiac function, perhaps by virtue of the modification of parasympathetic effects.},

However, the association of heart rate variability and the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) is not well described. The authors report on the association of baseline cardiac autonomic activity (1987–1989) with incident CHD after 3 years (1990–1992) of follow-up of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study cohort selected from four study centers in the United States by using a case-cohort design. The authors examined 137 incident cases of CHD and a stratified random sample of 2, 252 examinees free of CHD at baseline. Baseline, supine, resting beat-to-beat heart rate data were collected. High- (0.16–0.35 Hz) and low- (0.025–0.15 Hz) frequency spectral powers and high-/low-frequency power ratio, estimated from spectral analysis, and standard deviation of all normal R-R intervals, calculated from time domain analysis, were used as the conventional indices of cardiac parasym-pathetic, sympatho-parasympathetic, and their balance, respectively. Incident CHD was defined sis hospitalized myocardial infarction, fatal CHD, or cardiac revascularization procedures during 3 years of follow-up. The age, race, gender, and other CHD risk factor-adjusted relative risks (and 95{\%} confidence intervals) of incident CHD comparing the lowest quartile with the upper three quartiles of high-frequency power, low-frequency power, high-/low-frequency power ratio, and standard deviation of R-R intervals were 1.72 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.17–2.51), 1.09 (95{\%} CI 0.72–1.64), 1.25 (95{\%} CI 0.84–1.86), and 1.39 (95{\%} CI 0.94–2.04), respectively. The findings from this population-based, prospective study suggest that altered cardiac autonomic activity, especially lower parasympathetic activity, is associated with the risk of developing CHD.

METHODS: The study included 34 male war veterans with diagnosed PTSD who had suffered a first MI and 34 age-matched post-MI patients without PTSD. Cardiac autonomic balance was evaluated through HRV analysis. RESULTS: There were no differences in the mean R-R interval or overall HRV between the analyzed groups. Post-MI patients with PTSD had lower values for the square root of the mean of squared successive differences in R-R intervals (p = 0.02), the percentage of R-R intervals that were {\textgreater} or =50 milliseconds different from the previous interval (p = 0.03), and the high-frequency component (p = 0.03) but had higher values for the low-frequency component (p = 0.01) and the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio (p = 0.02), compared with post-MI patients without PTSD. CONCLUSION: Post-MI patients with PTSD have higher sympathetic and lower parasympathetic heart rate modulation activity, compared with patients with MI and no PTSD.},

Methods: Psychological stress was induced using a public speaking task. Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) were recorded at rest, during mental stress, and during recovery. QTd was calculated as the difference between the longest and the shortest QT interval in the 12-lead ECG. Rest-stress myocardial perfusion imaging was also performed to detect mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia. Results: Mental stress induced a significant increase in QTd compared to the resting condition (P {\textless} 0.001). This effect persisted beyond the first 10 minutes of recovery (P {\textless} 0.001). QTd was significantly associated with the development of mental stress ischemia with ischemic patients having significantly higher QTd during mental stress than nonischemic patients (P = 0.006). This finding remained significant after controlling for possible confounding factors (P = 0.01). Conclusion: An acute psychological stress induces a significant increase in QTd, which persists for more than 10 minutes after the cessation of the stressor. This effect seems to be, at least partially, mediated by the development of mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia. (PACE 2009; 32:1178-1183).},

abstract = {Background • The need for treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among combat veterans returning from Afghanistan and Iraq is a growing concern. PTSD has been associated with reduced cardiac coherence (an indica-tor of heart rate variability [HRVl) and deficits in early stage information processing (attention and immediate memory) in different studies. However, the co-occurrence of reduced coherence and cognition in combat veterans with PTSD has not been studied before. Primary Study Objective • A pilot study was undertaken to assess the covariance of coherence and information processing in combat veterans. An additional study goal was assessment of effects of HRV biofeedback (HRVB) on coherence and informa-tion processing in these veterans. Methods/Design • A two-group (combat veterans with and with-out PTSD), pre-post study of coherence and information process-ing was employed with baseline psychometric covariates. Setting • The study was conducted at a VA Medical Center outpatient mental health clinic. Participants • Five combat veterans from Iraq or Afghanistan with PTSD and five active-duty soldiers with comparable com-bat exposure who were without PTSD. Intervention • Participants met with an HRVB professional once weekly for 4 weeks and received visual feedback in HRV patterns while receiving training in resonance frequency breath-ing and positive emotion induction. Primary Outcome Measures • Cardiac coherence, word list learning, commissions (false alarms) in go-no go reaction time, digits backward. Results • Cardiac coherence was achieved in all participants, and the increase in coherence ratio was significant post-HRVB training. Significant improvements in the information process-ing indicators were achieved. Degree of increase in coherence was the likely mediator of cognitive improvement. Conclusion • Cardiac coherence is an index of strength of con-trol of parasympathetic cardiac deceleration in an individual that has cardinal importance for the individual's attention and af{\'{i}}{\'{e}}ct regulation.},

abstract = {Meditation refers to a family of practices that may share many similarities, but can have differences in underlying methods and goals. Religious and spiritual associations are common but are not requisite for meditation practice and it should be recognized that the basis of many if not all practices is the training of the brain and body, a process that appears to have profound effects on both structure and function. In recent decades there has been interest regarding the effects of these ancient practices on the cardiovascular system, as meditation has intuitive appeal for benefit in this area. Though there is a relative shortage of quality data, available evidence suggests that meditation may exert beneficial effects on autonomic tone, autonomic reflexes, and decrease blood pressure acutely and after long term practice. In addition, meditation has the potential to positively influence the cardiovascular system through the mind-heart connection and the anti-inflammatory reflex. There is limited but promising data to suggest that meditation based interventions can have beneficial effects on patients with established cardiovascular disease. More high quality and unbiased studies of meditation practices on relevant endpoints in cardiovascular disease are needed, including the effects of such practices on inflammation, baseline heart rate variability, arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Information is limited about the independent prognostic value of repolarization abnormalities in women. METHODS AND RESULTS We evaluated hazard ratios for ECG variables for combined fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease (CHD) events and for CHD mortality using Cox regression in 38,283 Women's Health Initiative (WHI) participants during up to 9.2 years of follow-up. All risk models were adjusted for demographic, clinical, and therapeutic variables. Evaluated as single ECG variables, wide QRS/T angle and ECG-demonstrated myocardial infarction (ECG-MI) were the strongest predictors of CHD events, with hazard ratios (95{\%} CI) of 1.90 (1.50 to 2.42) and 1.62 (1.29 to 2.03), respectively. Six other repolarization variables were also significant, strong predictors of CHD events. Wide QRS/T angle, ECG-MI, and QT prolongation appeared as dominant predictors when evaluated simultaneously with other ECG variables in a multiadjusted risk model. QRS/T angle, ECG-MI, and high QRS nondipolar voltage were the strongest predictors of CHD mortality, with hazard ratios of 2.70, 2.41, and 2.18, respectively. The risk increase ranged from 63{\%} to 95{\%} for the other 4 significant predictors. Five ECG abnormalities were identified as dominant mortality risk predictors: wide QRS/T angle, ECG-MI, high QRS nondipolar voltage, reduced heart rate variability, and QT prolongation (in the cardiovascular disease-free group only). CONCLUSIONS Ventricular repolarization abnormalities in postmenopausal women are as important predictors of CHD events and CHD mortality as ECG-MI and other QRS abnormalities. Repolarization variables and QRS nondipolar voltage warrant attention in future investigations.},

abstract = {Depression increases the risk of cardiac mortality and morbidity in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), but the mechanisms that underlie this association remain unclear. This review considers the evidence for several behavioral and physiological mechanisms that might explain how depression increases the risk for incident coronary disease and for subsequent cardiac morbidity and mortality. The candidate mechanisms include: (1) antidepressant cardiotoxicity; (2) association of depression with cardiac risk factor such as cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and reduced functional capacity; (3) association of depression with greater coronary disease severity; (4) nonadherence to cardiac prevention and treatment regimens; (5) lower heart rate variability (HRV) reflecting altered cardiac autonomic tone; (6) increased platelet aggregation; and (7) inflammatory processes. Despite recent advances in our understanding of these potential mechanisms, further research is needed to determine how depression increases risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {Standard heart rate variability (HRV) techniques have been questioned in the sleep and autonomic fields as imprecise measures of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. A new technique has emerged, known as phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA). PRSA is used to quantify the quasi-periodic accelerations and decelerations in short-term heart rate, an effect that is normally masked by artifacts and noise. When applied to a signal of peak-to-peak (RR) time intervals, these quasiperiodicities can be used to estimate overall vagal activity, quantified as deceleration capacity (DC) and acceleration capacity (AC). We applied the PRSA analysis to a healthy cohort (ages 21-60 yr) enrolled in a clinical sleep trial, in which ECG data during wakefulness and sleep were available. We found that DC and AC were significantly attenuated with increasing age: a 0.27 ms/yr decrease in DC and a 0.29 ms/yr increase in AC (P{\textless}0.001). However, even in the older subjects, DC values were higher then previously found in people post-myocardial infarction. We also found a drop in percentage of normal-to-normal intervals where the current interval deviated{\textgreater}50 ms from the previous interval with age, with a decrease of 0.84{\%}/yr. We did not find any differences between younger and older subjects with traditional HRV techniques, such as low-frequency or high-frequency power. Overall, the study provides normative PRSA data and suggests that PRSA is more sensitive than other HRV measurements. We propose that the decrease in DC and AC may be a sensitive marker for autonomic changes with aging. Further work will be required to determine whether the observed changes predict poorer cardiac health prognosis.},

Our aim was to compare changes in various biomarkers in CAD patients and age-matched healthy male subjects during "real-life" emotional excitement. Enthusiastic male ice hockey spectators (CAD n = 18, healthy subjects n = 16) attended Finnish national ice hockey play-off matches. Heart rate variability, plasma catecholamines, endothelin-1 (ET-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were determined at the baseline and during the match. A significantly more marked increase in both ET-1 and IL-6 was observed in CAD patients compared with healthy subjects during the match (time × group interaction p = 0.009 and p = 0.018 for ET-1 and IL-6, respectively). The high-frequency power of R-R intervals decreased in CAD patients (p {\textless} 0.001) but did not change in healthy subjects (p = ns, time × group interaction p {\textless} 0.001).

abstract = {Power spectral analysis of the beat-to-beat variations of heart rate or the heart period (R–R interval) has become widely used to quantify cardiac autonomic regulation (Appel et al., 1989; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Denver et al., 2007; Thayler et al., 2010; Billman, 2011). This technique partitions the total variance (the “power”) of a continuous series of beats into its frequency components, typically identifying two or three main peaks: Very Low Frequency (VLF) {\textless}0.04 Hz, Low Frequency (LF), 0.04–0.15 Hz, and High Frequency (HF) 0.15–0.4 Hz. It should be noted that the HF peak is shifted to a higher range (typically 0.24–1.04 Hz) in infants and during exercise (Berntson et al., 1997). The HF peak is widely believed to reflect cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity while the LF, although more complex, is often assumed to have a dominant sympathetic component (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Billman, 2011). Based upon these assumptions, Pagani and co-workers proposed that the ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF) could be used to quantify the changing relationship between sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activities (i.e., the sympatho-vagal balance) (Pagani et al., 1984, 1986; Malliani et al., 1991) in both health and disease. However, this concept has been challenged (Kingwell et al., 1994; Koh et al., 1994; Hopf et al., 1995; Eckberg, 1997; Houle and Billman, 1999; Billman, 2011). Despite serious and largely under-appreciated limitations, the LF/HF ratio has gained wide acceptance as a tool to assess cardiovascular autonomic regulation where increases in LF/HF are assumed to reflect a shift to “sympathetic dominance” and decreases in this index correspond to a “parasympathetic dominance.” Therefore, it is vital to provide a critical assessment of the assumptions upon which this concept is based.},

abstract = {Two symbolic indexes, the percentage of sequences characterized by three heart periods with no significant variations (0V{\%}) and that with two significant unlike variations (2UV{\%}), have been found to reflect changes in sympathetic and vagal modulations, respectively. We tested the hypothesis that symbolic indexes may track the gradual shift of the cardiac autonomic modulation during an incremental head-up tilt test. Symbolic analysis was carried out over heart period variability series (250 cardiac beats) derived from ECG recordings during a graded head-up tilt test (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 degrees ) in 17 healthy subjects. The percentage of subjects showing a significant linear correlation (Spearman rank-order correlation) with tilt angles was utilized to evaluate the performance of symbolic analysis. Spectral analysis was carried out for comparison over the same series. 0V{\%} progressively increased with tilt angles, whereas 2UV{\%} gradually decreased. The decline of 2UV{\%} was greater than the increase of 0V{\%} at low tilt angles. Linear correlation with tilt angles was exhibited in a greater percentage of subjects for 0V{\%} and 2UV{\%} than for any spectral index. Our findings suggest that symbolic analysis performed better than spectral analysis and, thus, is a suitable methodology for assessment of the subtle changes of cardiac autonomic modulation induced by a graded head-up tilt test. Moreover, symbolic analysis indicates that the changes of cardiac sympathetic and vagal modulations observed during this protocol were reciprocal but characterized by different absolute magnitudes.},

abstract = {Objectives To determine if cardiorespiratory biofeedback increases heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with documented coronary artery disease (CAD). Background Diminished HRV has been associated with increased cardiac morbidity and mortality. Evidence suggests that various lifestyle changes and pharmacologic therapies can improve HRV. The objective of this study was to determine if biofeedback increases HRV in patients with CAD. Methods Patients with established CAD (n = 63; mean age, 67 years) were randomly assigned to conventional therapy or to 6 biofeedback sessions consisting of abdominal breath training, heart and respiratory physiologic feedback, and daily breathing practice. HRV was measured by the standard deviation of normal-to-normal QRS complexes (SDNN) at week 1 (pretreatment), week 6 (after treatment), and week 18 (follow-up). Results Baseline characteristics were similar for the treatment and control groups. The SDNN for the biofeedback and control groups did not differ at baseline or at week 6 but were significantly different at week 18. The biofeedback group showed a significant increase in SDNN from baseline to week 6 (P {\textless} .001) and to week 18 (P = .003). The control subjects had no change from baseline to week 6 (P = .214) and week 18 (P = .27). Conclusions Biofeedback increases HRV in patients with CAD and therefore may be an integral tool for improving cardiac morbidity and mortality rates.},

The mean heart rate for depressed patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) was significantly higher than for nondepressed CAD patients, independent of the patient's age, smoking status, and beta blocker therapy. Heart rate variability was lower in depressed patients but did not achieve significance. With the exception of smoking, which was more common in depressed patients, there were no significant differences between the depressed and nondepressed patients on any other medical or demographic variable assessed. It is concluded that elevated heart rate may represent increased sympathetic tone in depressed CAD patients, and may help to explain the increased morbidity and mortality reported in these patients.},

The number of current depressive symptoms was assessed using the Beck Depressive Inventory II (BDI-II). The association between methylation variation and depressive symptoms was examined using matched twin-pair analyses, adjusting for body mass index, smoking, physical activity, and alcohol consumption. Multiple testing was controlled by adjusted false discovery rate (q value). RESULTS: Intrapair difference in DNA methylation variation at 10 of the 20 studied CpG sites is significantly correlated with intrapair difference in BDI scores. Linear regression using intrapair differences demonstrates that intrapair difference in BDI score was significantly associated with intrapair differences in DNA methylation variation after adjusting for potential confounders and correction for multiple testing. On average, a 10{\%} increase in the difference in mean DNA methylation level was associated with 4.4 increase in the difference in BDI score (95{\%} confidence interval = 0.9-7.9, p = .01). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that variation in methylation level within the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene is associated with variation in depressive symptoms in a large sample of monozygotic twin pairs. This relationship is not confounded by genetic and shared environment. The 5-HTTLPR genotype also does not modulate this association.},

abstract = {Autonomic and eyeblink reactivity to startling tones were investigated in women with histories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA). Twenty-one women with current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 23 with lifetime but not current PTSD, and 13 women who never had PTSD listened to 15 95-dB, 500-ms, 1000-Hz tones with a 0-ms rise time while heart rate (HR), skin conductance (SC), and orbicularis oculi electromyogram (EMG) responses were measured. Participants in the current and lifetime PTSD groups produced larger HR responses across tones and showed slower absolute habituation of SC response magnitude compared with the never PTSD group. EMG response magnitudes did not differ among groups. Women with CSA-related PTSD showed increased autonomic reactivity and slower habituation to high-intensity tones similar to that observed in primarily male, combat PTSD samples. This suggests that heightened autonomic responsivity to startling stimuli in PTSD is not gender or event specific. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although early trauma (trauma in childhood) has been linked to adult inflammation and adult disease of inflammatory origin, it remains unknown whether this relationship is due to long-term consequences of early life stress or other familial factors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We examined 482 male middle-aged twins (241 pairs) born between 1946 and 1956 from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Childhood traumatic experiences, before the age of 18 years, were measured retrospectively with the Early Trauma Inventory and included physical, sexual, emotional abuse and general trauma. Lifetime major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease were also assessed. Plasma C-reactive protein and interleukin 6 were measured to determine levels of inflammation. Mixed-effects regression models with a random intercept for pair were used to separate between- and within-twin pair effects.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: When twins were analyzed as individuals, increasing levels of early trauma were positively related to C-reactive protein (p = .03) but not to interleukin 6 (p = .12). When estimating within- and between-pair effects, only the between-pair association of early trauma with the inflammatory markers remained significant.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The link between early trauma and inflammation is largely explained by familial factors shared by the twins because levels of inflammation were highest when both twins were exposed to trauma. Exposure to early trauma may be a marker for an unhealthy familial environment. Clarification of familial factors associated with early stress and adult inflammation will be important to uncover correlates of stress and disease.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between polymorphic variation in alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor genes and cardiovascular activity at rest and in response to psychological challenge in a sample in which the heritability of these cardiovascular phenotypes may be established. METHODS: Several common polymorphisms were characterized within ADRA1B (alpha1B), ADRA2A (alpha2A), ADRB1 (beta1) and ADRB2 (beta2) and examined in relation to heart rate (HR) and systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, both at rest and in response to stress. Participants were 309 European-American, young adult men and women (including 101 monozygotic and 44 dizygotic twin pairs). RESULTS: In the full sample, participants carrying any G allele at base pair (bp) 1165 in ADRB1 exhibited elevated resting SBP and DBP and a larger DBP response to mental challenge compared to homozygotes for the C allele (P {\textless} 0.04). An AA genotype at bp 145 in ADRB1 was also associated with higher resting SBP and DBP than AG or GG genotypes (P {\textless} 0.03). At bp 46 in ADRB2, GG homozygotes had higher resting DBP than subjects possessing any A allele (P {\textless} 0.05). For the same polymorphism, however, AG heterozygotes showed lower SBP than both AA and GG homozygotes (P {\textless} 0.05). In a subsample of genetically unrelated individuals, ADRB1 (1165) continued to predict resting SBP, DBP and DBP response to stress (P {\textless} 0.03), while ADRB2 (46) was associated with resting SBP (P {\textless} 0.04) but not DBP. Finally, the degree of allele sharing at ADRB1 (1165) also predicted variability in SBP and DBP at rest among dizygotic twin pairs (P {\textless} 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that some polymorphic variation within adrenoreceptor genes contributes to interindividual variability in resting SBP and DBP and in DBP response to mental challenge.},

abstract = {The vagal (high frequency [HF]) component of heart rate variability (HRV) predicts survival in post-myocardial infarction patients and is considered to reflect vagal antagonism of sympathetic influences. Previous studies of the neural correlates of vagal tone involved mental stress tasks that included cognitive and emotional elements. To differentiate the neural substrates of vagal tone due to emotion, we correlated HF-HRV with measures of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) derived from positron emission tomography (PET) and15O-water in 12 healthy women during different emotional states. Happiness, sadness, disgust and three neutral conditions were each induced by film clips and recall of personal experiences (12 conditions). Inter-beat intervals derived from electrocardiographic recordings during the 60-second scans were spectrally-analyzed, generating 12 separate measures of HF-HRV in each subject. The six emotion and six neutral conditions were grouped together and contrasted. We observed substantial overlap between emotion-specific rCBF and the correlation between emotion-specific rCBF and HF-HRV, particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex. Emotion-specific rCBF also correlated with HF-HRV in the caudate nucleus, periacqueductal gray and left mid-insula. We also observed that the elements of cognitive control inherent in this experiment (that involved focusing on the target mental state) had definable neural substrates that correlated with HF-HRV and to a large extent differed from the emotion-specific correlates of HF-HRV. No statistically significant asymmetries were observed. Our findings are consistent with the view that the medial visceromotor network is a final common pathway by which emotional and cognitive functions recruit autonomic support. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The stratification of post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients at risk of sudden cardiac death remains important. The aim of the present study was to assess the prognostic value of novel T-wave morphology descriptors derived from resting 12-lead ECGs. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 280 consecutive post-MI patients, a 12-lead ECG was recorded before discharge, optically scanned, and digitized. For the present study, 5 T-wave morphology descriptors were automatically calculated after singular value decomposition of the ECG signal. The total cosine R-to-T (TCRT [describes the global angle between repolarization and depolarization wavefront]) and the T-wave loop dispersion were univariately associated (P:=0.0002 and P:{\textless}0.002, respectively, U: test) with 27 prospectively defined clinical events in 261 patients (mean follow-up 32+/-10 months). Kaplan-Meier event probability curves for strata above and below the median confirmed the strong risk discrimination by TCRT and T-wave loop dispersion (P:{\textless}0.003 and P:{\textless}0.001, respectively, log-rank test). On Cox regression analysis, with the entering of age, left ventricular ejection fraction, heart rate, QRS width, reperfusion therapy, beta-adrenergic-blocker treatment, and standard deviation of R-R intervals on 24-hour Holter monitoring, TCRT (P:{\textless}0.03) yielded independent predictive value, whereas T-wave loop dispersion was of borderline independence (P:=0.064). Heart rate (P:{\textless}0.02), left ventricular ejection fraction (P:{\textless}0.02), and reperfusion therapy (P:{\textless}0.02) also remained in the final model. CONCLUSIONS: Computerized T-wave morphology analysis of the 12-lead resting ECG permits independent assessment of post-MI risk and an improved risk stratification when combined with other risk markers.},

Maximal heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) and T-wave peak-to-end (TpTe) intervals and QRS, QT, JT, QTapex, and TpTe dispersions and variation coefficients were measured manually and calculated from 12-lead ECGs obtained on admission. Clinical, radiological, and 2-dimensional echocardiographic data were also recorded. Primary end points were all-cause, Chagas' disease-related, and sudden cardiac mortalities. During a follow-up of 58+/-39 months, 62 patients died, 54 of Chagas' disease-related causes and 40 suddenly. Multivariate Cox survival analysis revealed that the QT-interval dispersion (QTd) (hazard ratio, 1.45; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.29 to 1.63; P{\textless}0.001, for 10-ms increments) and left ventricular (LV) end-systolic dimension (hazard ratio, 1.36; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.21 to 1.53; P{\textless}0.001, for 5-mm increments) were the strongest independent predictors for all end points. The maximum QTc interval (QTcmax) could substitute for QTd with a worse predictive performance. Other predictors were heart rate, presence of pathological Q waves, frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and isolated left anterior fascicular block (LAFB) on the ECGs. Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated that a QTd {\textgreater} or =65 ms or a QTcmax {\textgreater} or =465 ms1/2 discriminated the 2 groups with significantly different prognoses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Electrocardiographic QTd and echocardiographic LV end-systolic dimension were the most important mortality predictors in patients with Chagas' disease.

Positive results would indicate promising areas to pursue in a follow-up study.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: Six participants met for 10 sessions over 4 weeks. The research team measured each participant's heart rate, HRV, blood pressure (BP), and immediate mood before and after the laughter and control interventions. The team assessed participants' longer-term mood (anxiety and depression) at the study's initiation, after a no-treatment control week, and at the end of the study.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSETTING: The study occurred at the Department of Surgery and Medicine at the University of Arizona Health Sciences Center, Tucson.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPARTICIPANTS: Participants were patients awaiting transplants (three heart and three lung), two women and four men (ages 51-69 y). Participants had received no major surgery in the 3 months prior to the intervention, did not have a hernia or uncontrolled hypertension, and did not fall into the New York Heart Association function class 4.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERVENTION: The 20-minute laughter intervention involved breathing and stretching exercises, simulated laughter (ie, unconditional laughter that is not contingent on the environment), chanting, clapping, and a meditation. The 20-minute control intervention involved the study's personnel discussing health and study-related topics with the participants.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOUTCOME MEASURES: The research team measured BP, heart rate, and HRV and administered the Profile of Mood States, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory-II to evaluate immediate and longer-term mood. The team had planned quantitative statistical analysis of the data at the study's initiation but did not complete it because the number of enrolled participants was too low for the analysis to be meaningful. The team visually examined the data, however, for trends that would indicate areas to examine further in a follow-up study.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Participants showed improved immediate mood (vigor-activity and friendliness) and increased HRV after the laughter intervention. Both the laughter and control interventions appeared to improve longer-term anxiety.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between depressed mood and parasympathetic control of the heart in healthy men and women at rest and during two stressors. METHODS: Fifty-three healthy college students completed a laboratory stress protocol that included a baseline resting period, a challenging speech task, and a forehead cold pressor task. Depressed mood was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Parasympathetic cardiac control was measured as the high-frequency (0.12-0.40 Hz) component (HF) of heart rate variability using power spectrum analysis. Blood pressure, respiration rate, and respiration amplitude were measured simultaneously. RESULTS: Participants were categorized as having a high or low depressed mood on the basis of median splits of their BDI scores. Those in the high depressed mood group had significantly greater reductions in HF during the speech task and significantly smaller increases in HF during the forehead cold pressor task than those in the low depressed mood group. Women had significantly greater reductions in HF during the speech task and smaller increases in HF during the forehead cold pressor task than men. However, gender and depressed mood did not interact to predict changes in HF. CONCLUSIONS: Depressed mood is related to the magnitude of decrease in parasympathetic cardiac control during stressors in healthy men and women. These findings extend those of previous studies, in which a similar phenomenon was observed among patients with cardiac disease. Because the participants in this study were healthy, the relationship between depressed mood and parasympathetic cardiac control does not seem to be secondary to cardiovascular disease.{\$}\backslash{\$}n},

abstract = {Abnormal serotonin transporter (5-HTT) function and autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation has been proposed in panic disorder. However, in contrast to hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) functioning, ANS reactivity during panic response has yet not been investigated in humans with respect to the 5-HTT genotype. The present study assessed the influence of challenging by cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) on heart rate variability (HRV) measures, to monitor autonomic reactivity and its relationship to 5-HTT-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) genotypes. We hypothesized substantial effects of the 5-HTTLPR genotype on autonomic reactivity. We studied 30 healthy young men, 15 of each with the long/long (l/l) or short/short (s/s) genotype for the 5-HTTLPR. All participants received an intravenous application of 50$\mu$g CCK-4. HRV measures were assessed in both groups at baseline and immediately after CCK-4 application. Our results indicated lower parasympathetic activity in s/s carriers during baseline, time and frequency domain measures. CCK-4 application significantly enhanced the sympathetic tone in both groups, leading to diminished group differences. A significant treatment by genotype effect indicated reduced autonomic reactivity to CCK-4 challenge in the s/s compared to l/l carriers. Our findings show enhanced sympathetic and/or diminished cardiac vagal activity under basal conditions and blunted autonomic reactivity in s/s vs. l/l carriers. Our study provides novel data supporting claims that the s/s genotype represents a genetic vulnerability factor associated with inadequate hyporeactivity to stress and extends current knowledge on the impact of the central serotonergic activity on the sympathoadrenal pathway. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate the ability of microvolt-level T-wave alternans (MTWA) to identify prospectively patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) at risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmic events and to compare its predictive accuracy with that of conventional risk stratifiers. BACKGROUND: Patients with DCM are at increased risk of sudden death from ventricular tachyarrhythmias. At present, there are no established methods of assessing this risk. METHODS: A total of 137 patients with DCM underwent risk stratification through assessment of MTWA, left ventricular ejection fraction, baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), heart rate variability, presence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), signal-averaged electrocardiogram, and presence of intraventricular conduction defect. The study end point was either sudden death, resuscitated ventricular fibrillation, or documented hemodynamically unstable VT. RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 14 ± 6 months, MTWA and BRS were significant univariate predictors of ventricular tachyarrhythmic events (p {\textless} 0.035 and p {\textless} 0.015, respectively). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that only MTWA was a significant predictor. CONCLUSIONS: Microvolt-level T-wave alternans is a powerful independent predictor of ventricular tachyarrhythmic events in patients with DCM. {\textcopyright} 2003 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {The intimate connection between the brain and the heart was enunciated by Claude Bernard over 150 years ago. In our neurovisceral integration model we have tried to build on this pioneering work. In the present paper we further elaborate our model. Specifically we review recent neuroanatomical studies that implicate inhibitory GABAergic pathways from the prefrontal cortex to the amygdala and additional inhibitory pathways between the amygdala and the sympathetic and parasympathetic medullary output neurons that modulate heart rate and thus heart rate variability. We propose that the default response to uncertainty is the threat response and may be related to the well known negativity bias. We next review the evidence on the role of vagally mediated heart rate variability (HRV) in the regulation of physiological, affective, and cognitive processes. Low HRV is a risk factor for pathophysiology and psychopathology. Finally we review recent work on the genetics of HRV and suggest that low HRV may be an endophenotype for a broad range of dysfunctions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Serotonin (5-HT) is crucial to normal reflex vagal modulation of heart rate (HR). Reduced baroreflex sensitivity [spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (sBRS)] and HR variability (HRV) reflect impaired neural, particularly vagal, control of HR and are independently associated with depression. In conscious, telemetered Flinders-Sensitive Line (FSL) rats, a well-validated animal model of depression, we tested the hypothesis that cardiovascular regulatory abnormalities are present and associated with deficient serotonergic control of reflex cardiovagal function. In FSL rats and control Flinders-Resistant (FRL) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat strains, diurnal measurements of HR, arterial pressure (AP), activity, sBRS, and HRV were made. All strains had normal and similar diurnal variations in HR, AP, and activity. In FRL rats, HR was elevated, contributing to the reduced HRV and sBRS in this strain. In FSL rats, sBRS and high-frequency power HRV were reduced during the night, indicating reduced reflex cardiovagal activity. The ratio of low- to high-frequency bands of HRV was increased in FSL rats, suggesting a relative predominance of cardiac sympathetic and/or reflex activity compared with FRL and SD rats. These data show that conscious FSL rats have cardiovascular regulatory abnormalities similar to depressed humans. Acute changes in HR, AP, temperature, and sBRS in response to 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, a 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1B), and 5-HT(7) receptor agonist, were also determined. In FSL rats, despite inducing an exaggerated hypothermic effect, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin did not decrease HR and AP or improve sBRS, suggesting impaired serotonergic neural control of cardiovagal activity. These data suggest that impaired serotonergic control of cardiac reflex function could be one mechanism linking reduced sBRS to increased cardiac risk in depression.},

abstract = {We investigated the effects of laughing and weeping induced by watching comedy and tragedy videos on mood and autonomic nervous function. Ten healthy female subjects volunteered for the experiment. Chest electrocardiogram and respiration curve were recorded before, after, and during watching a comedy or a tragedy video. We also asked them to fill out profiles of mood states (POMS) to evaluate their mood states while watching videos. Autonomic nervous function was estimated by spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). All subjects more or less laughed and wept while watching comedy and tragedy videos, respectively. Anger-hostility score of the POMS decreased and vigor score increased significantly after watching comedy videos, while depression-dejection score increased significantly after watching tragedy ones. Although both contents tended to increase a low to high frequency component ratio (LF/HF ratio) of HRV, the time course of responses was different. The LF/HF ratio which reflects cardiac sympathovagal balance increased immediately after they started watching comedy videos, and returned to the basal level right after they stopped watching, whereas the LF/HF ratio increased gradually to a lesser extent while watching tragedy videos. In contrast, the high-frequency component which reflects cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity gradually decreased while watching both videos but did not return to the basal level after watching tragedy ones. These results suggest that laughing has strong but transient effects on the autonomic nervous system, while weeping or feeling sad has moderate but sustained effects on it.},

abstract = {Introduction: Studies evaluating changes in HRV preceding the onset of ventricular arrhythmias using conventional techniques have shown inconsistent results. Time-frequency analysis of HRV is traditionally performed using short-term Fourier transform (STFT). Wavelet transform (WT) may however be better suited for analyzing non-stationary signals such as heart rate recordings. Methods and results: We studied patients with a history of myocardial infarction implanted with a defibrillator with an extended memory. The RR intervals during the 51 min preceding ventricular events requiring electrical therapy were retrieved, and HRV studied by WT and STFT. 111 episodes of ventricular arrhythmia were retrieved from 41 patients (38 males, age 64 ± 8 years). Heart rate increased significantly before arrhythmia. There was no significant variation in low frequency/high frequency components (LF/HF) observed for the group as a whole, probably due to a great degree of heterogeneity amongst individuals. A subset of 30 patients also had heart rate recordings performed during normal ICD follow-up. WT did not show any difference in HRV before arrhythmia onset and during control conditions. Conclusion: Variations in HRV before onset of ventricular arrhythmias were not apparent in this large dataset, despite use of optimal tools for studying time-frequency analysis. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Concurrent estimates of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF; obtained by positron emission tomography), heart period, and high-frequency heart period variability (HF-HPV; an indicator of cardiac parasympathetic activity) were examined in 93 adults (aged 50-70 years) who performed a series of increasingly difficult working-memory tasks. Increased task difficulty resulted in decreased heart period (indicating cardioacceleration) and decreased HF-HPV (indicating decreased cardiac parasympathetic activity). Task-induced decreases in heart period and HF-HPV were associated with concurrent increases and decreases in rCBF to cortical and subcortical brain regions that are speculated to regulate cardiac autonomic activity during behavioral processes: the medial-prefrontal, insular, and anterior cingulate cortices, the amygdala-hippocampal complex, and the cerebellum. These findings replicate and extend a small number of functional neuroimaging studies that suggest an important role for both cortical and subcortical brain systems in human cardiac autonomic regulation.},

Some epidemiological studies suggest that individuals with diabetes may be a particularly susceptible population. This study examined effects of short-term exposures to ambient PM2.5 on markers of systemic inflammation, coagulation, autonomic control of heart rate, and repolarization in 22 adults (mean age: 61 years) with type 2 diabetes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Each individual was studied for four consecutive days with daily assessments of plasma levels of blood markers. Cardiac rhythm and electrocardiographic parameters were examined at rest and with 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitors. PM2.5 and meteorological data were measured daily on the rooftop of the patient exam site. Data were analyzed with models adjusting for season, weekday, meteorology, and a random intercept. To identify susceptible subgroups, effect modification was analyzed by clinical characteristics associated with insulin resistance as well as with oxidative stress and by medication intake.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha showed a significant increase with a lag of two days (percent change of mean level: 20.2{\%} with 95{\%}-confidence interval [6.4; 34.1] and 13.1{\%} [1.9; 24.4], respectively) in association with an increase of 10 mug/m3 in PM2.5. Obese participants as well as individuals with elevated glycosylated hemoglobin, lower adiponectin, higher ferritin or with glutathione S-transferase M1 null genotype showed higher IL-6 effects. Changes in repolarization were found immediately as well as up to four days after exposure in individuals without treatment with a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Exposure to elevated levels of PM2.5 alters ventricular repolarization and thus may increase myocardial vulnerability to arrhythmias. Exposure to PM2.5 also increases systemic inflammation. Characteristics associated with insulin resistance or with oxidative stress were shown to enhance the association.},

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) involves repeated sampling of subjects' current behaviors and experiences in real time, in subjects' natural environments. EMA aims to minimize recall bias, maximize ecological validity, and allow study of microprocesses that influence behavior in real-world contexts. EMA studies assess particular events in subjects' lives or assess subjects at periodic intervals, often by random time sampling, using technologies ranging from written diaries and telephones to electronic diaries and physiological sensors. We discuss the rationale for EMA, EMA designs, methodological and practical issues, and comparisons of EMA and recall data. EMA holds unique promise to advance the science and practice of clinical psychology by shedding light on the dynamics of behavior in real-world settings.},

Nineteen patients with angiographically documented CAD and either major or minor depression were compared with a sample of nondepressed CAD patients according to age, sex, and smoking status. All patients underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring, and the standard deviation of all normal-to-normal intervals was used as the primary index of HR variability. HR variability was significantly lower in depressed than nondepressed patients (90 ± 35 vs 117 ± 26 ms; p {\textless} 0.01), even after adjusting for relevant covariates.

abstract = {Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) and increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are both predictors of coronary artery disease and correlate with each other. We examined whether these 2 phenotypes share a common genetic substrate and investigated the relations of the CRP gene polymorphisms with both CRP levels and HRV indexes. We examined 236 male twins free of symptomatic coronary artery disease, with a mean age ± SD of 54 ± 2.9 years. The plasma CRP levels were measured and the frequency domain measures of HRV were assessed using a 24-hour electrocardiographic recording, including ultra-low-, very-low-, low-, and high-frequency power. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CRP gene were genotyped. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association between CRP and HRV, as well as the genotype-phenotype association. Bivariate structural equation modeling was performed to estimate the genetic and environmental correlations between CRP and HRV and the explanatory effect of CRP gene polymorphisms on the CRP-HRV association. Both CRP (h2= 0.76) and HRV indexes (h2= 0.56 to 0.64) showed high heritability. Greater CRP levels were significantly associated with lower HRV. A robust genetic correlation was found between CRP and ultra-low-frequency power (rG= -0.3, p = 0.001). One CRP single nucleotide polymorphism (rs1205) was significantly associated with both CRP (p = 0.003) and ultra-low-frequency power (p = 0.005) and explained 11{\%} of the genetic covariance between them. In conclusion, reduced HRV correlates significantly with increased CRP plasma levels and this correlation is due, in large part, to common genetic influences. A polymorphism in the CRP gene contributes to both CRP levels and HRV. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Abstract CONTEXT: Major depressive disorder (MDD) associated with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) increases the risk of mortality. Decreased heart rate variability (HRV), also a predictor of mortality, is reduced in patients with MDD after ACS, and has been suggested to be a mediator of MDD mortality after ACS. Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may reduce mortality post-ACS, little is known about their effects on HRV. OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of both sertraline and improvement in mood on HRV. METHODS: The Sertraline Antidepressant Heart Attack Randomized Trial assessed HRV from 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram recordings at baseline in 290 patients and from a second recording in 258 of these patients 16 weeks after randomization to sertraline or placebo. Frequency domain measures of HRV included high-frequency power, low-frequency power, very low-frequency power, ultra low-frequency power, and total power. Depression severity was measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Clinical response was measured with the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement scale. RESULTS: At baseline, prior episodes of MDD were associated with lower HRV. Sertraline significantly increased ultra low-frequency power, while improvement in mood was associated with higher low-frequency power independent of treatment. However, the expected recovery in HRV following ACS was not observed in patients with MDD. Higher ultra low-frequency during sertraline treatment and higher low-frequency power in patients whose mood improved resulted primarily from these measures decreasing in their comparison groups. CONCLUSIONS: Heart rate variability recovery is impaired in depressed patients after ACS. Previously reported differences in baseline HRV between patients with and without depression after ACS grew larger in the 16 weeks following a coronary event. Both sertraline treatment and symptomatic recovery from depression were associated with increased HRV compared with placebo-treated and nonrecovered post-ACS control groups, respectively, but this results primarily from decreased HRV in the comparison groups.Publication Type Comparative Study.

@article{Libby2012,
abstract = {Background: High-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) is a measure of parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) output that has been associated with enhanced self-regulation. Low resting levels of HF-HRV are associated with nicotine dependence and blunted stress-related changes in HF-HRV are associated with decreased ability to resist smoking. Meditation has been shown to increase HF-HRV. However, it is unknown whether tonic levels of HF-HRV or acute changes in HF-HRV during meditation predict treatment responses in addictive behaviors such as smoking cessation. Purpose: To investigate the relationship between HF-HRV and subsequent smoking outcomes. Methods: HF-HRV during resting baseline and during mindfulness meditation was measured within two weeks of completing a 4-week smoking cessation intervention in a sample of 31 community participants. Self-report measures of smoking were obtained at a follow up 17-weeks after the initiation of treatment. Results: Regression analyses indicated that individuals exhibiting acute increases in HF-HRV from resting baseline to meditation smoked fewer cigarettes at follow-up than those who exhibited acute decreases in HF-HRV (b = -4.89, p = 0.008). Conclusion: Acute changes in HF-HRV in response to meditation may be a useful tool to predict smoking cessation treatment response.},

abstract = {Background--Preliminary data suggest that the analysis of R-R interval variability by fractal analysis methods may provide clinically useful information on patients with heart failure. The purpose of this study was to compare the prognostic power of new fractal and traditional measures of R-R interval variability as predictors of death after acute myocardial infarction.  Methods and Results--Time and frequency domain heart rate (HR) variability measures, along with short- and long-term correlation (fractal) properties of R-R intervals (exponents {\{}alpha{\}}1 and {\{}alpha{\}}2) and power-law scaling of the power spectra (exponent {\{}beta{\}}), were assessed from 24-hour Holter recordings in 446 survivors of acute myocardial infarction with a depressed left ventricular function (ejection fraction [{\textless}=]35{\%}). During a mean{\{}+/-{\}}SD follow-up period of 685{\{}+/-{\}}360 days, 114 patients died (25.6{\%}), with 75 deaths classified as arrhythmic (17.0{\%}) and 28 as nonarrhythmic (6.3{\%}) cardiac deaths. Several traditional and fractal measures of R-R interval variability were significant univariate predictors of all-cause mortality. Reduced short-term scaling exponent {\{}alpha{\}}1 was the most powerful R-R interval variability measure as a predictor of all-cause mortality ({\{}alpha{\}}1 {\textless}0.75, relative risk 3.0, 95{\%} confidence interval 2.5 to 4.2, P{\textless}0.001). It remained an independent predictor of death (P{\textless}0.001) after adjustment for other postinfarction risk markers, such as age, ejection fraction, NYHA class, and medication. Reduced {\{}alpha{\}}1 predicted both arrhythmic death (P{\textless}0.001) and nonarrhythmic cardiac death (P{\textless}0.001).  Conclusions--Analysis of the fractal characteristics of short-term R-R interval dynamics yields more powerful prognostic information than the traditional measures of HR variability among patients with depressed left ventricular function after an acute myocardial infarction.},

abstract = {Acute coronary syndrome encompasses a broad and heterogeneous population that challenges the clinician at each step of treatment in terms of: 1) diagnosis; 2) appropriate risk stratification; 3) therapeutic decision making; and 4) monitoring response to therapy. Although there are many established tools for diagnosis, prognosis, and clinical decision making, understanding the advantages and limitations of each tool according the clinical scenario is essential. Several emerging tools, such as novel biomarkers (e.g., high-sensitivity troponin and growth differential factor-15), ECG techniques (e.g., heart rate turbulence or T-wave alternans), and imaging modalities (computed tomography angiography and cardiac magnetic resonance) may potentially improve clinical care; however, they must be fully evaluated and validated in different scenarios and patient cohorts before they are incorporated into clinical practice. This review identifies promising new or emerging techniques, as well as established tools, and reviews their current or potential role in clinical practice. {\textcopyright} 2010 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Trauma is associated with increased risk for anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To further understand biologic mechanisms of PTSD, we examined the dark-enhanced startle response, a psychophysiological correlate of anxiety, and heart rate variability (HRV) in traumatized individuals with and without PTSD. The associations of these measures with PTSD may be sex-specific because of their associations with the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, a sexually dimorphic brain structure in the limbic system that is approximately 2.5 times larger in men than in women.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The study sample (N = 141) was recruited from a highly traumatized civilian population seeking treatment at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. Psychophysiological responses during a dark-enhanced startle paradigm task included startle magnitude, assessed by eyeblink reflex, and measures of high-frequency HRV, during light and dark phases of the startle session.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The startle magnitude was higher during the dark phase than the light phase (mean ± standard error = 98.61 ± 10.68 versus 73.93 ± 8.21 $\mu$V, p {\textless} .001). PTSD was associated with a greater degree of dark-enhanced startle in women (p = .03) but not in men (p = .38, p interaction = .48). Although HRV measures did not differ between phases, high-frequency HRV was greater in men with PTSD compared with men without PTSD (p = .02).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the dark-enhanced paradigm provides novel insights into the psychophysiological responses associated with PTSD in traumatized civilian sample. Sex differences in altered parasympathetic and sympathetic function during anxiety regulation tasks may provide further insight into the neurobiological mechanisms of PTSD.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Mental stress provokes myocardial ischemia in many patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) portends a worse prognosis, independent of standard cardiac risk factors or outcome of traditional physical stress testing. Angiotensin II plays a significant role in the physiological response to stress, but its role in MSIMI remains unknown. Our aim was to evaluate whether the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) is associated with a differential effect on the incidence of MSIMI compared with ischemia during physical stress.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Retrospective analysis of 218 patients with stable CAD, including 110 on ACEI, was performed. 99m-Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging was used to define ischemia during mental stress, induced by a standardized public speaking task, and during physical stress, induced by either exercise or adenosine.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Overall, 40 patients (18{\%}) developed MSIMI and 80 patients (37{\%}) developed ischemia during physical stress. MSIMI occurred less frequently in patients receiving ACEIs (13{\%}) compared with those not on ACEIs (24{\%}; p = .030, adjusted odds ratio = 0.42, 95{\%} confidence interval = 0.19-0.91). In contrast, the frequency of myocardial ischemia during physical stress testing was similar in both groups (39{\%} versus 35{\%} in those on and not on ACEIs, respectively); adjusted odds ratio = 0.91, 95{\%} confidence interval = 0.48-1.73).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: In this retrospective study, patients using ACEI therapy displayed less than half the risk of developing ischemia during mental stress but not physical stress. This possible beneficial effect of ACEIs on MSIMI may be contributing to their salutary effects in CAD.},

Monitoring of regulated physiologic processes using physiomarkers such as heart rate variability may be important in the early diagnosis of subacute, potentially catastrophic illness. Early in the course of neonatal sepsis, there are physiomarkers of reduced heart rate variability and transient decelerations similar to fetal distress. The goal of this study was to determine the degree of increased risk for sepsis, urinary tract infection (UTI), and death when these abnormal heart rate characteristics (HRC) were observed.$\backslash$nMethods. We monitored 1022 infants at 2 tertiary care NICUs, 458 of whom were very low birth weight. We calculated an HRC index from validated regression models relating mathematical features of heart rate time series and histograms to episodes of illness. We calculated the risks for adverse events of sepsis, UTI, and death for infants stratified by HRC measurements.$\backslash$nResults. Compared with infants with low-risk HRC measurements, infants with high-risk HRC measurements had 5- to 6-fold increased risk for an adverse event in the next day and 3-fold increased risk in the next week. Laboratory tests that were relevant to infection added information to HRC measurements. Infants with both high-risk HRC and abnormal laboratory tests had 6- to 7-fold increased risk for an adverse event in the next day compared with infants who had neither.$\backslash$nConclusion. HRC are noninvasively monitored physiomarkers that identify infants in the NICU who are at high risk for sepsis, UTI, and death.},

abstract = {The association of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with cardiovascular disease risk may be mediated by inflammation. Our objective was to examine the association between PTSD and measures of inflammation and to determine whether these associations are due to shared familial or genetic factors. We measured lifetime history of PTSD using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV in 238 male middle-aged military veteran twin pairs (476 individuals), selected from the Vietnam Era Twins Registry, who were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline. We assessed inflammation using levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), fibrinogen, white blood cells, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Geometric mean levels and percent differences by PTSD were obtained from mixed-model linear regression analyses with adjustment for potential confounders. Within-pair analysis was conducted to adjust for shared family environment and genetics (monozygotic pairs). Overall, 12.4{\%} of participants had a lifetime history of PTSD. Adjusted mean levels of hsCRP and ICAM-1 were significantly higher among those with vs. without PTSD [hsCRP: 1.75 vs. 1.31. mg/l (33{\%} difference); ICAM-1: 319 vs. 293. ng/ml (9{\%} difference)]. Adjustment for depression rendered the association of PTSD with hsCRP non-statistically significant. For IL-6, no consistent association was seen. Within-pair analysis produced associations that were similar in direction for all three markers but lesser in magnitude for hsCRP and IL-6. There was no evidence of interaction by zygosity. Elevated hsCRP and ICAM-1 are associated with PTSD, and these associations may be confounded by shared non-genetic, antecedent familial and environmental factors. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {AIMS: The aim of this study involves the early identification, among apparently healthy individuals, of those at high risk for sudden cardiac death. We tested the hypothesis that individuals who respond to mild mental stress in preparation for exercise test with the largest heart rate increases might be at highest risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from 7746 civil servants participating in the Paris Prospective Study I, followed-up for 23 years, allowed to compare heart rate changes between rest and mild mental stress (preparation prior to an exercise test) between subjects who suffered sudden cardiac death (n = 81), non-sudden (n = 129) coronary death, or death from any cause (n = 1306). The mean heart rate increase during mild mental stress was 8.9 +/- 10.8 b.p.m. Risk of sudden cardiac death increased progressively with heart rate increase during mental stress and the relative risk of the third vs. the first tertile was 2.09 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.13-3.86) after adjustment for confounders. This relationship was not observed for non-sudden coronary death. CONCLUSION: An important heart rate increase produced by a mild mental stress predicts long-term risk for sudden cardiac death. Heart rate changes before an exercise test may provide a simple tool for risk stratification.},

abstract = {The methods used to assess cardiac parasympathetic (cardiovagal) activity and its effects on the heart in both humans and animal models are reviewed. Heart rate (HR)-based methods include measurements of the HR response to blockade of muscarinic cholinergic receptors (parasympathetic tone), beat-to-beat HR variability (HRV) (parasympathetic modulation), rate of post-exercise HR recovery (parasympathetic reactivation), and reflex-mediated changes in HR evoked by activation or inhibition of sensory (afferent) nerves. Sources of excitatory afferent input that increase cardiovagal activity and decrease HR include baroreceptors, chemoreceptors, trigeminal receptors, and subsets of cardiopulmonary receptors with vagal afferents. Sources of inhibitory afferent input include pulmonary stretch receptors with vagal afferents and subsets of visceral and somatic receptors with spinal afferents. The different methods used to assess cardiovagal control of the heart engage different mechanisms, and therefore provide unique and complementary insights into underlying physiology and pathophysiology. In addition, techniques for direct recording of cardiovagal nerve activity in animals; the use of decerebrate and in vitro preparations that avoid confounding effects of anesthesia; cardiovagal control of cardiac conduction, contractility, and refractoriness; and noncholinergic mechanisms are described. Advantages and limitations of the various methods are addressed, and future directions are proposed.},

abstract = {Background: Studies of the autonomic nervous system in posttraumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) have focused on the sympathetic modulation of arousal and have neglected the parasympathetic contribution. This study addresses the parasympathetic control of heart rate in individuals who have survived traumatic events. Methods: Twenty-nine survivors, 14 with current PTSD and 15 without, participated in the study. The groups were comparable with regard to age, type of trauma, time since the latest traumatic event, and lifetime exposure to traumatic events. Electrocardiograms were recorded during rest and an arithmetic task. Heart period, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and the amplitude of the Traube-Hering-Mayer wave were quantified. Results: The groups did not differ on resting measures. During the arithmetic task, the past trauma group showed a significant increase in RSA (p {\textless} .007), whereas the PTSD group did not. In the past trauma group only, RSA and heart period were highly correlated (r = .75), thereby suggesting that the response to challenge was under vagal control. Conclusions: Trauma survivors who develop PTSD differ from those who do not in the extent to which their heart rate response to challenge is controlled by vagal activity. Responses to challenge in PTSD may be mediated by nonvagal, possibly sympathetic mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2001 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

@article{Goldberger1999,
abstract = {There are complex interactions between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system inputs to the sinus node. The concept of "sympathovagal balance" reflects the autonomic state resulting from the sympathetic and parasympathetic influences. Despite widespread usage of a variety of heart rate (HR) variability parameters as indexes of sympathovagal balance, no index has been validated as a measure of sympathovagal balance. This study evaluated the utility of HR, HR variability, and a new parameter termed the vagal-sympathetic effect (VSE) as indexes of sympathovagal balance. The ideal parameter had to satisfy the following criteria: 1) the index should vary similarly among subjects in response to different autonomic conditions; 2) the variability in the index among subjects exposed to the same autonomic conditions should be small; and 3) the response of the index to various autonomic conditions should reflect the underlying changes in physiological state and have a meaningful interpretation. Volunteers [8 men, 6 women; mean age 28.5 {\{}+/-{\}} 4.8 (SD) yr] were evaluated for the effects of sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation and blockade on HR and HR variability. VSE was defined as the ratio of the R-R interval to the intrinsic R-R interval. VSE and R-R interval consistently changed in the expected directions with parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation and blockade. A general linearized model was used to evaluate the response of each parameter. VSE and R-R interval had r2 values of 0.847 and 0.852, respectively. Natural logarithm of the low-frequency power had an r2 value of 0.781 with lower r2 values for all the other HR variability parameters. The coefficient of variation was also lowest for each condition tested for the VSE and the R-R interval. VSE and R-R interval best satisfy the criteria for the ideal index of sympathovagal balance. Because it is impractical under most conditions to measure the VSE as the index of sympathovagal balance, the most suitable index is the R-R interval.

HRV analysis was performed by 24-h holter ECG. Renal damage was assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), vascular damage by carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), and cardiac damage by left ventricular mass index.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Significantly lower values of the ratio of low to high frequency power (LF/HF) were found in the patients with moderate or severe eGFR (p-value {\textless} 0.001). Similarly, depressed values of indexes of the overall autonomic modulation on heart were found in patients with plaque compared to those with a normal IMT (p-value {\textless}0.05). These associations remained significant after adjustment for other factors known to contribute to the development of target organ damage, such as age. Moreover, depressed LF/HF was found also in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy but this association was not significant after adjustment for other factors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Depressed HRV appeared to be associated with vascular and renal TOD, suggesting the involvement of autonomic imbalance in the TOD. However, as the mechanisms by which abnormal autonomic balance may lead to TOD, and, particularly, to renal organ damage are not clearly known, further prospective studies with longitudinal design are needed to determine the association between HRV and the development of TOD.},

Research indicates that respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) biofeedback increases HRV while reducing related pathological symptoms. This controlled pilot study compared RSA biofeedback to progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) as adjunctive interventions for 38 persons with PTSD symptoms in a residential treatment facility for a substance use disorder. Both groups were assessed at pre-intervention and 4-week post-intervention. Group × time interactions revealed significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms and increases in HRV indices for the RSA group. Both groups significantly reduced PTSD and insomnia symptoms and a statistical trend was observed for reduced substance craving for the RSA group. Increases in HRV were significantly associated with PTSD symptom reduction. Overall, these results provide preliminary support for the efficacy of RSA biofeedback in improving physiological and psychological health for individuals with PTSD. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

@article{Lown1977,
abstract = {Brain stimulation can provoke a variety of arrhythmias and lower the ventricular vulnerable threshold. In the animal with acute myocardial ischemia such stimuli suffice to provoke ventricular fibrillation. Vagal neural traffic or adrenal catecholamines are not the conduits for this brain-heart linkage. Accompanying increases in heart rate or blood pressure are not prerequisites for the changes in cardiac excitability. Increased sympathetic activity, whether induced by neural or neurohumoral action, predisposes the heart to ventricular fibrillation. Protection can be achieved with surgical and pharmacologic denervation or reflex reduction in sympathetic tone. With acute myocardial ischemia, augmented sympathetic activity accounts for the early surge of ectopic activity frequently precipitating ventricular fibrillation. Asymmetries in sympathetic neural discharge may also contribute to the genesis of serious arrhythmias. The vagus nerve, through its muscarinic action, exerts an indirect effect on cardiac vulnerability, the consequence of annulment of concomitant adrenergic influence, rather than of any direct cholinergic action on the ventricles. There exist anatomic, physiologic as well as molecular bases for such interactions. Available experimental evidence indicates that environmental stresses of diverse types can injure the heart, lower the threshold of cardiac vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation and, in the animal with coronary occlusion, provoke potentially malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Available evidence indicates that in man, as in the experimental animal, administration of catecholamines can induce ventricular arrhythmia, whereas vagal activity exerts an opposite effect. Furthermore, in certain subjects diverse stresses and various psychologic states provoke ventricular ectopic activity. {\textcopyright} 1977 Dun {\textperiodcentered} Donnelley Publishing Corporation 666 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10019 All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Various combinations of sympathetic and vagal tone can yield the same heart rate, while ventricular electrophysiology differs. To demonstrate this in humans, we studied healthy volunteers in the sitting position with horizontal legs. First, heart rate was increased by lowering the legs to 60 degrees and back. Thereafter, heart rate was increased by handgrip. In each subject, a leg-lowering angle was selected at which heart rate matched best with heart rate in the third handgrip minute. Thirteen subjects had a heart rate match better than 1{\%}. Heart rate (control: 65.2+/-9.0 bpm) increased to 72.1+/-8.7 (leg lowering) and to 72.1+/-8.8 (handgrip) bpm. QRS azimuth, QRS duration, maximal T vector, T azimuth, T elevation, ST duration, QRS-T angle and QT interval differed significantly (P{\textless}0.05) between leg lowering and handgrip (QT interval 418+/-15 versus 435+/-21 ms). Also, septal dispersion of repolarization, assessed as the time difference between the apex and the end of the T wave in the V2 and V3 leads, differed significantly (V2: 96.7+/-19.3 versus 110.0+/-23.3 ms, P{\textless}0.01; V3: 88.7+/-19.3 versus 97.3+/-23.3 ms; P{\textless}0.01). Hence, leg lowering and handgrip cause different ventricular depolarization and repolarization. The hypertensive handgrip manoeuvre entails a longer QT interval and probably an increased septal dispersion of repolarization.},

@article{DeBoer1987,
abstract = {A beat-to-beat model of the cardiovascular system is developed to study the spontaneous short-term variability in arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) data from humans at rest. The model consists of a set of difference equations representing the following mechanisms: 1) control of HR and peripheral resistance by the baroreflex, 2) Windkessel properties of the systemic arterial tree, 3) contractile properties of the myocardium (Starling's law and restitution), and 4) mechanical effects of respiration on BP. The model is tested by comparing power spectra and cross spectra of simulated data from the model with spectra of actual data from resting subjects. To make spectra from simulated data and from actual data tally, it must be assumed that respiratory sinus arrhythmia at rest is caused by the conversion of respiratory BP variability into HR variability by the fast, vagally mediated baroreflex. The so-called 10-s rhythm in HR and BP appears as a resonance phenomenon due to the delay in the sympathetic control loop of the baroreflex. The simulated response of the model to an imposed increase of BP is shown to correspond with the BP and HR response in patients after administration of a BP-increasing drug, such as phenylephrine. It is concluded that the model correctly describes a number of important features of the cardiovascular system. Mathematical properties of the difference-equation model are discussed.},

abstract = {Background: Many traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) are associated with altered autonomic function. Inflammation may provide a link between risk factors, autonomic dysfunction, and CAD. We examined the association between heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function, and inflammation, measured by C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Methods: We examined 264 middle-aged male twins free of symptomatic CAD. All underwent ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring and 24-hour ultra low, very low, low, and high-frequency power were calculated using power spectral analysis. C-reactive protein and IL-6 were measured, and risk factors including age, smoking, hypertension, lipids, diabetes, body mass index (BMI), depression, and physical activity were assessed. Results: Physical activity, BMI, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, depression, and hypertension were directly associated with CRP and IL-6 and inversely associated with one or more HRV variables. There was a graded inverse relationship between all HRV parameters (except high frequency) and CRP and IL-6. After adjustment for age, BMI, activity, high-density lipoprotein, smoking, hypertension, depression, and diabetes, ultra low frequency and very low frequency remained significant predictors of CRP (P {\textless} .01). Conclusions: C-reactive protein is associated with decreased HRV, even after controlling for traditional CAD risk factors. Autonomic dysregulation leading to inflammation may represent one pathway through which traditional risk factors promote development of CAD. {\textcopyright} 2008 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.},

METHODS: A systematic literature search in the period of 2002-2009 for PTSD, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disease was conducted. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 78 studies on PTSD and cardiovascular/metabolic disease and biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Although the available literature suggests an association of PTSD with cardiovascular disease and biomarkers, further research must consider potential confounds, incorporate longitudinal designs, and conduct careful PTSD assessments in diverse samples to address gaps in the research literature. Research on metabolic disease and biomarkers suggests an association with PTSD, but has not progressed as far as the cardiovascular research.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postexercise measurement of heart rate (HR) recovery and QT interval dynamics provides prognostic information in various patient populations. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess whether the measurement of the spatial relationship between the depolarization and repolarization wavefronts (total cosine R-to-T [TCRT]) during the postexercise recovery phase would yield prognostic information. METHODS: The population consisted of 1297 patients (56 ± 13 years; 67{\%} men) who performed a clinically indicated bicycle stress test. The exercise-recovery hysteresis of TCRT was quantified from the 12-lead exercise electrocardiogram by measuring the TCRT/HR loop area bounded by the exercise and first 3-minute postexercise recovery curves. The HR-corrected TCRT/HR hysteresis was calculated by dividing the area with the HR decrement during the first 3 minutes of recovery. HR recovery was measured at 1 minute postexercise recovery. End points were cardiac death and sudden cardiac death. RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 45 ± 12 months, 74 patients died (5.7{\%}); 35 (2.6{\%}) were cardiac deaths and 24 (1.9{\%}) were sudden cardiac deaths. Reduced TCRT/HR loop area and TCRT/HR hysteresis were associated with cardiac mortality (P {\textless}.001). After adjustments for clinical variables, including ejection fraction, TCRT/HR loop area remained an independent predictor of cardiac death (hazard ratio 5.6; 95{\%} confidence interval 1.6-19.1; P = .007) and sudden cardiac death (10.7; 95{\%} confidence interval 1.4-83.7; P = .024). HR recovery did not remain a significant predictor in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Attenuated hysteresis of the depolarization and repolarization wavefronts during postexercise recovery is associated with an increased risk of cardiac and sudden cardiac death. Analysis of repolarization dynamics from exercise electrocardiogram represents a promising tool for risk stratification. {\textcopyright} 2012 Heart Rhythm Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: There is extensive evidence that the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system can modulate psychophysiological arousal. To date, no studies have investigated associations between cardiac vagal tone and the time course of arousal during exposure to trauma-related stimuli in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods: Thirty-one subjects, 29 with PTSD and 2 with partial PTSD, had electrocardiograms recorded during baseline and 2-minute traumatic and neutral script-driven imagery periods. Heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and heart rate half-recovery to the trauma script were quantified, and subjects were divided into low and high baseline RSA groups. Results: Across all participants, heart rate significantly increased from the neutral to the trauma script and RSA significantly decreased from baseline to trauma script (p {\textless} .05). As predicted, low RSA subjects had more prolonged heart rate increases to the trauma script than high RSA subjects (p {\textless} .001), and heart rate half-recovery was negatively correlated to baseline RSA (r = -.50, p = .005). Conclusions: This study is the first to find decreased RSA in response to a traumatic reminder and an association between low baseline RSA and sustained conditioned arousal in PTSD. Low vagal tone may account for deficient arousal and emotion regulation capacities often observed in PTSD.},

abstract = {Background: Many traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) are associated with altered autonomic function. Inflammation may provide a link between risk factors, autonomic dysfunction, and CAD. We examined the association between heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function, and inflammation, measured by C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Methods: We examined 264 middle-aged male twins free of symptomatic CAD. All underwent ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring and 24-hour ultra low, very low, low, and high-frequency power were calculated using power spectral analysis. C-reactive protein and IL-6 were measured, and risk factors including age, smoking, hypertension, lipids, diabetes, body mass index (BMI), depression, and physical activity were assessed. Results: Physical activity, BMI, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, depression, and hypertension were directly associated with CRP and IL-6 and inversely associated with one or more HRV variables. There was a graded inverse relationship between all HRV parameters (except high frequency) and CRP and IL-6. After adjustment for age, BMI, activity, high-density lipoprotein, smoking, hypertension, depression, and diabetes, ultra low frequency and very low frequency remained significant predictors of CRP (P {\textless} .01). Conclusions: C-reactive protein is associated with decreased HRV, even after controlling for traditional CAD risk factors. Autonomic dysregulation leading to inflammation may represent one pathway through which traditional risk factors promote development of CAD. {\textcopyright} 2008 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Unmanaged emotional reactions to stress not only lead to behavior problems in young people but also create physiological conditions that inhibit learning and potentially increase the risk of disease later in life. For these reasons, the integration of emotional self-management skills training programs has become an increased priority in some schools. In this study, middle school students enrolled in a course in emotional competence skills learned techniques designed to intercept stressful responses during emotionally challenging situations. Behavioral outcomes were assessed using the Achievement Inventory Measure and autonomic function was measured by heart rate variability (HRV) analysis during and after a stressful interview. Following the program, students exhibited significant improvements in areas including stress and anger management, risky behavior, work management and focus, and relationships with family, peers and teachers. These improvements were sustained over the following six months. Students using the skills taught in the course to recover from acute emotional stress were also able to positively modulate their physiological stress responses. As compared to a control group, trained students demonstrated significantly increased HRV and more rhythmic, sine wave-like heart rhythm patterns during recovery. This response pattern reflects increased parasympathetic activity, heart rhythm coherence, and entrainment of other biological oscillatory systems to the primary heart rhythm frequency. Increased physiological coherence is associated with improved cognitive performance, emotional balance, mental clarity and health outcomes. These physiological shifts could promote the sustained psychological and behavioral improvements associated with the use of emotional management skills. It is suggested that learning emotional competence skills in childhood establishes healthier physiological response patterns which can benefit learning and long-term health. Results provide support for the integration in school curricula of courses designed to teach effective self-management skills to children.},

In this paper, we proposed a modified DC index based on improved phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA) algorithm. Sinusoidal analysis is applied to elucidate the rationality of the improved PRSA. Then the validity of the modified DC is verified by the databases of chronic heart failure (CHF) patients and control group. Both the conventional and modified DCs are significantly lower in CHF patients than that in the control group (2.12 +/- 2.98 vs. 6.34 +/- 1.92 ms, P {\textless} 0.0001 and 5.45 +/- 2.48 vs. 10.64 +/- 1.76 ms, P {\textless} 0.0001, respectively). And the modified DC provides higher accuracy in distinguishing CHF than the conventional one (87.4 vs. 82.1{\%}). The results indicate that the suggested technique enhances the performance of PRSA and improves the efficiency of DC in assessing ANS activity in CHF patients.},

abstract = {Power spectral analysis (PSA) of heart rate variability (HRV) offers reliable assessment of cardiovascular autonomic responses, providing a 'window' onto the interaction of peripheral sympathetic and parasympathetic tone. Alterations in HRV are associated with various physiological and pathophysiological processes, and may contribute to morbidity and mortality. Previous studies of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) found lower resting HRV in patients compared to controls, suggesting increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic tone. This article describes the analysis of HRV at rest and after psychological stress in panic disorder (PD) patients, in an enlarged sample of PTSD patients, and in healthy control subjects. Standardized heart rate (HR) analysis was carried out in 14 PTSD patients, 11 PD patients and 25 matched controls. ECG recordings were made while subjects were resting ('rest 1'), while recalling the trauma implicated in PTSD, or the circumstances of a severe panic attack, as appropriate ('recall'), and again while resting ('rest 2'). Controls were asked to recall a stressful life event during recall. While both patient groups had elevated HR and low frequency (LF) components of HRV at baseline (suggesting increased sympathetic activity), PTSD patients, unlike PD patients and controls, failed to respond to the recall stress with increases in HR and LF. HRV analysis demonstrates significant differences in autonomic regulation of PTSD and PD patients compared to each other and to control subjects. HRV analysis may augment biochemical studies of peripheral measures in these disorders. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {It has long been hypothesized that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) increases coronary heart disease (CHD) risk; however, empirical evidence is limited. In the first prospective study to date, individuals with higher PTSD symptom levels had a significantly increased risk for CHD, after controlling for known coronary risk factors. PTSD indicates a chronic stress reaction and is hypothesized to influence CHD either by causing biological alterations that lead to cardiovascular damage, or by leading to adverse health behaviors that increase CHD risk. A key issue is whether PTSD contributes to the development of CHD, if PTSD and CHD share common pathways, or if CHD causes PTSD. Research combined across different disciplines suggests that prolonged or chronic stress does influence the development of CHD. A better understanding of the relationship will increase prevention and intervention efforts. Cardiologists may be most effective when they can recognize and manage emotional distress in practice.},

abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between depression and heart rate variability in cardiac patients. Methods: Heart rate variability was measured during 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring in 40 medically stable out-patients with documented coronary heart disease meeting current diagnostic criteria for major depression, and 32 nondepressed, but otherwise comparable, patients. Patients discontinued $\beta$-blockers and antidepressant medications at the time of study. Depressed patients were classified as mildly (n = 21) or moderately-to-severely depressed (n = 19) on the basis of Beck Depression Inventory scores. Results: There were no significant differences among the groups in age, gender, blood pressure, history of myocardial infarction, diabetes, or smoking. Heart rates were higher and nearly all indices of heart rate variability were significantly reduced in the moderately-to-severely versus the nondepressed group. Heart rates were also higher and mean values for heart rate variability lower in the mildly depressed group compared with the nondepressed group, but these differences did not attain statistical significance. Conclusion: The association of moderate to severe depression with reduced heart rate variability in patients with stable coronary heart disease may reflect altered cardiac autonomic modulation and may explain their increased risk for mortality.

abstract = {Inflammation is a risk factor for both depression and cardiovascular disease. Depressed mood is also a cardiovascular risk factor. To date, research into mechanisms through which inflammation impacts cardiovascular health rarely takes into account central effects on autonomic cardiovascular control, instead emphasizing direct effects of peripheral inflammatory responses on endothelial reactivity and myocardial function. However, brain responses to inflammation engage neural systems for motivational and homeostatic control and are expressed through depressed mood state and changes in autonomic cardiovascular regulation. Here we combined an inflammatory challenge, known to evoke an acute reduction in mood, with neuroimaging to identify the functional brain substrates underlying potentially detrimental changes in autonomic cardiovascular control.We first demonstrated that alterations in the balance of low to high frequency (LF/HF) changes in heart rate variability (a measure of baroreflex sensitivity) could account for some of the inflammation-evoked changes in diastolic blood pressure, indicating a central (rather than solely local endothelial) origin. Accompanying alterations in regional brain metabolism (measured using 18FDG-PET) were analysed to localise central mechanisms of inflammation-induced changes in cardiovascular state: three discrete regions previously implicated in stressor-evoked blood pressure reactivity, the dorsal anterior and posterior cingulate and pons, strongly mediated the relationship between inflammation and blood pressure. Moreover, activity changes within each region predicted the inflammation-induced shift in LF/HF balance. These data are consistent with a centrally-driven component originating within brain areas supporting stressor evoked blood pressure reactivity. Together our findings highlight mechanisms binding psychological and physiological well-being and their perturbation by peripheral inflammation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prolonged reaction to an extremely traumatic experience. One of the core symptoms of PTSD is hyper-arousal which can be the result of an elevated activation of the autonomic nervous system. Including psychophysiological assessment methods in PTSD research can point to the neurobiological bases of the disorder. The studies of psychophysiology of PTSD to date have mostly measured reactivity. The aim of the current study was to compare resting state psychophysiology and startle reflexes in PTSD patients and controls in a sample of Croatian combat veterans. We measured heart-rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, skin conductance, and eyeblink muscle contraction during an acclimation period and during the presentation of startle stimuli in 45 male PTSD patients and 33 male healthy controls. We found that PTSD patient had elevated baseline heart-rate and decreased respiratory sinus arrhythmia compared to the controls. Furthermore, PTSD patients had impaired habituation to the startle probe, but there was no group difference in initial startle magnitude. There was also no group difference in skin conductance level or skin conductance response. Startle habituation and baseline heart-rate appear to offer the most reliable psychophysiological indices of PTSD. This finding replicates trends in the literature in a new population of PTSD patients. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) has been widely used as a measure of the cardiac vagal control in response to stress. However, RSA seems not to be a generalized indicator because of its dependency on respiratory parameter and individual variations of RSA amplitude (A(RSA)). We hypothesized that phase-lag variations between RSA and respiration may serve as a normalized index of the degree of mental stress. Twenty healthy volunteers performed mental arithmetic task (ART) after 5 min of resting control followed by 5 min of recovery. Breathing pattern, beat-to-beat R-R intervals, and blood pressure (BP) were determined using inductance plethysmography, electrocardiography, and a Finapres device, respectively. The analytic signals of breathing and RSA were obtained by Hilbert transform and the degree of phase synchronization ($\lambda$) was quantified. With the use of spectral analysis, heart rate variability (HRV) was estimated for the low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) bands. A steady-state 3-min resting period (REST), the first 3 min (ART1), and the last 3 min (ART2) of the ART period (ranged from 6- to 19 min) and the last 3 min of the recovery period (RCV) were analyzed separately. Heart rate, systolic BP, and breathing frequency (f(R)) increased and $\lambda$, A(RSA), and HF power decreased from REST to ART (P {\textless} 0.01). The $\lambda$ was correlated with normalized A(RSA) and the HF power. The decrease in $\lambda$ could not be explained solely by the increase in f(R). We conclude that mental stress exerts an influence on RSA oscillations, inducing incoherent phase lag with respect to breathing, in addition to a decrease in RSA.},

We hypothesized that individuals with PTSD would exhibit lower BRS than those without PTSD. Methods: Participants were 80 PTSD patients and 50 controls aged 18-68 years. All participants were smokers, many were veterans (55{\%}), and 60 were women. Beat-to-beat BP was collected during a 5-min baseline rest periods from which estimates of BRS were derived using the sequence method. Results: Women with PTSD exhibited lower BRS (M = 10.5, S.D. = 5.1) than women without PTSD (M = 14.6, S.D. = 10.7). For men, PTSD diagnosis was not associated with BRS, p {\textgreater} .05. Conclusions: Among women, PTSD was associated with reduced PNS functioning. Men with PTSD did not have attenuated BRS, which may be due to sample characteristics, such as age and combat veteran status. Reduced PNS activity may predispose women with PTSD to poorer cardiovascular health. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart failure patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) or an ICD for resynchronization therapy often visit the hospital for unscheduled examinations, placing a great burden on healthcare providers. We hypothesized that Internet-based remote interrogation systems could reduce emergency healthcare visits.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: This multicenter randomized trial involving 200 patients compared remote monitoring with standard patient management consisting of scheduled visits and patient response to audible ICD alerts. The primary end point was the rate of emergency department or urgent in-office visits for heart failure, arrhythmias, or ICD-related events. Over 16 months, such visits were 35{\%} less frequent in the remote arm (75 versus 117; incidence density, 0.59 versus 0.93 events per year; P=0.005). A 21{\%} difference was observed in the rates of total healthcare visits for heart failure, arrhythmias, or ICD-related events (4.40 versus 5.74 events per year; P{\textless}0.001). The time from an ICD alert condition to review of the data was reduced from 24.8 days in the standard arm to 1.4 days in the remote arm (P{\textless}0.001). The patients' clinical status, as measured by the Clinical Composite Score, was similar in the 2 groups, whereas a more favorable change in quality of life (Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire) was observed from the baseline to the 16th month in the remote arm (P=0.026).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Remote monitoring reduces emergency department/urgent in-office visits and, in general, total healthcare use in patients with ICD or defibrillators for resynchronization therapy. Compared with standard follow-up through in-office visits and audible ICD alerts, remote monitoring results in increased efficiency for healthcare providers and improved quality of care for patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

abstract = {Low heart rate (HR) variability is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but the causes and mechanisms of this association are not well known. This prospective study was designed to test the hypothesis that reduced HR variability is related to progression of coronary atherosclerosis. Average HR and HR variability were analyzed in 12-hour ambulatory ECG recordings from 265 qualified patients participating in a multicenter study to evaluate the angiographic progression of coronary artery disease in patients with prior coronary artery bypass surgery and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations ({\textless}1.1 mmol/L). Participants were randomized to receive a placebo or gemfibrozil therapy. The progression of coronary atherosclerosis was estimated by quantitative, computer-assisted analysis of coronary artery stenoses from the baseline angiograms and from repeated angiograms performed an average of 32 months later. The progression of focal coronary atherosclerosis of the patients randomized to placebo therapy was more marked in the tertile with the lowest standard deviation of all normal to normal R-R intervals (SDNN, 74+/-13 ms; mean decrease in the per-patient minimum luminal diameter -0.17 mm; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], -0.23 to -0.12 mm) than in the middle tertile (SDNN, 107+/-7 ms; mean decrease -0.05 mm; 95{\%} CI, -0.08 to -0.01 mm) or highest tertile (SDNN, 145+/-25 ms; mean change 0.01 mm; 95{\%} CI, -0. 04 to 0.02 mm) (P{\textless}0.001 between the tertiles). This association was abolished by gemfibrozil. SDNN was lower (P{\textless}0.001) and minimum HR was faster (P{\textless}0.01) in the patients with marked progression than in those with regression of focal coronary atherosclerosis. In multiple regression analysis including HR variability, minimum HR, demographic and clinical variables, smoking, blood pressure, glucose, lipid measurements and lipid-modifying therapy, progression of focal coronary atherosclerosis was independently predicted by the SDNN (beta=0.24; P=0.0001). Low HR variability analyzed from ambulatory ECG predicts rapid progression of coronary artery disease. HR variability provided information on progression of focal coronary atherosclerosis beyond that obtained by traditional risk markers of atherosclerosis.},

abstract = {Background: Patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) who experience depressed mood or psychological stress exhibit decreased vagal control of heart rate (HR), as assessed by spectral analysis of HR variability (HRV). Myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death are independently associated with depression and stress, as well as impaired vagal HR control. This study examined whether a behavioral neurocardiac intervention to reduce stress or depression can augment cardiovagal modulation in CHD patients. We hypothesized that (1) cognitive-behavioral training with HRV biofeedback would augment vagal recovery from acute stress, and (2) vagal regulation of HR would be inversely associated with stress and depression after treatment. Methods: This randomized controlled trial enrolled 46 CHD patients from 3 clinics of CHD risk reduction in Toronto and Vancouver, Canada. Subjects were randomized to five 1.5-hour sessions of HRV biofeedback or an active control condition. Outcome was assessed by absolute and normalized high-frequency spectral components (0.15-0.50 Hz) of HRV, and by the Perceived Stress Scale and Centre for Epidemiologic Studies in Depression scale. Results: Both groups reduced symptoms on the Perceived Stress Scale (P =. 001) and Centre for Epidemiologic Studies in Depression scale (P =. 004). Hierarchical linear regression determined that improved psychological adjustment was significantly associated with the high-frequency index of vagal HR modulation only in the HRV biofeedback group. Adjusted R2was as follows: HRV biofeedback group, 0.86 for stress (P =. 02) and 0.81 for depression (P =. 03); versus the active control group, 0.04 (P =. 57) and 0.13 (P =. 95), respectively. Conclusion: A novel behavioral neurocardiac intervention, HRV biofeedback, can augment vagal HR regulation while facilitating psychological adjustment to CHD. {\textcopyright} 2005, Mosby, Inc.

abstract = {Patients with panic disorder provide a clinical model of stress. On a "good day," free from a panic attack, they show persistent stress-related changes in sympathetic nerve biology, including abnormal sympathetic nerve single-fiber firing ("salvos" of multiple firing within a cardiac cycle) and release of epinephrine as a cotransmitter. The coreleased epinephrine perhaps originates from in situ synthesis by phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT). In searching for biological evidence that essential hypertension is caused by mental stress--a disputed proposition--we note parallels with panic disorder, which provides an explicit clinical model of stress: (1) There is clinical comorbidity; panic disorder prevalence is increased threefold in essential hypertension. (2) For both, epinephrine cotransmission is present in sympathetic nerves. (3) In panic disorder and essential hypertension, but not in health, single-fiber sympathetic nerve firing salvos occur. (4) Tissue nerve growth factor is increased in both conditions (nerve growth factor is a stress reactant). (5) There is induction of PNMT in sympathetic nerves. Essential hypertension exhibits a further manifestation of mental stress: there is activation of noradrenergic brain stem neurons projecting to the hypothalamus and amygdala. These pathophysiological findings strongly support the view that chronic mental stress is important in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension. A hypothesis now under test is whether in both disorders, under prevailing conditions of ongoing stress, PNMT induced in sympathetic nerves acts as a DNA methylase, causing the norepinephrine transporter (NET) gene silencing that is present in both conditions. PNMT can have an intranuclear distribution, binding to DNA. We have demonstrated that the reduced neuronal noradrenaline reuptake present in both disorders does have an epigenetic mechanism, with demonstrable reduction in the abundance of the transporter protein, the NET gene silencing being associated with DNA binding by the methylation-related inhibitory transcription factor MeCP2.},

abstract = {Hormone replacement therapy is universely associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) in observational studies, but it is unknown whether this association is mediated by the autonomic nervous system. We tested the hypothesis that postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy was associated with more favorable heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) in a population sample of women (n = 2,621). Hormone therapy use was measured at four examinations beginning in 1987. Supine HR and HRV indices were measured for 6 minutes at the final examination (1996-1998). In unadjusted linear regression models, hormone therapy was associated with lower HR (hormone use = 64.7 vs. never = 65.7 beats/min, P = .01) and higher HRV. However, following adjustment for age and CHD risk factors, both associations were eliminated. Results from this observational study suggest that hormone therapy is not associated with HR or HRV. These analyses should be replicated in a randomized trial. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that indexes describing heart rate (HR) dynamics may predict subsequent deaths of patients after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Because $\beta$-blocking (BB) drugs affect both mortality and HR dynamics, the prognostic power of measurements of HR dynamics may have changed in the current era of BB therapy. This study assessed the temporal changes and prognostic significance of time-domain, spectral, and fractal indexes of HR variability along with HR turbulence after an AMI among patients with optimized BB medication. SD of NN intervals, spectral indexes, the short-term fractal scaling exponent ($\alpha$1), power-law slope ($\beta$), and turbulence onset and slope were measured in 600 patients at 5 to 7 days after AMI and in 416 patients at 12 months after AMI. In the multivariate analysis, after adjusting for clinical variables, only reduced fractal HR indexes, $\alpha$1and $\beta$ (p {\textless}0.01 for both), turbulence onset, and slope (p {\textless}0.05 for both), measured at the convalescent phase after AMI, predicted subsequent cardiac death. All time-domain and spectral HR variability indexes and turbulence onset increased significantly during the 12-month period after AMI (p {\textless}0.001 for all), whereas the fractal indexes and turbulence slope remained unchanged. Late after AMI, reduced $\beta$ (p {\textless}0.05) and turbulence slope (p {\textless}0.01) were the only independent predictors of cardiac mortality. Traditional time-domain and spectral measurements of HR variability and turbulence onset improved significantly after AMI, whereas the fractal HR dynamics and turbulence slope remained stable. Fractal HR variability and HR turbulence retain their prognostic power in the BB era, when measured either at the convalescent or late phase after AMI. {\textcopyright} 2003 by Excerpta Medica, Inc.},

abstract = {Investigated cardiac autonomic function in 16 Ss (mean age 37.3 yrs) with panic disorder before and after treatment with paroxetine using Holter ECG records. Previous data suggest a relative increase in sympathetic activity in Ss with panic disorder, especially during sleep. Data for 20 hrs and awake and sleep periods were analyzed using spectral analysis to quantify absolute and relative heart period variability in ultra low (ULF), very low (VLF), low (LF) and high (HF) frequency bands. The authors also obtained fractal dimensions (FDs) for the 20-hour, awake, and sleep time series of RR intervals. Paroxetine treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the frequency and intensity of panic attacks and also on the state anxiety inventory. Paroxetine treatment produced a significant decrease of 20-hr absolute HF power, awake absolute LF power, and sleep absolute HF power. There was also a significant decrease of FDs after treatment with paroxetine for the sleep period. The decrease in LF and HF powers, and sleep FD is likely due to the antimuscarinic effect of paroxetine. The decrease in day-time LF power may also be due to a decrease in relative cardiac sympathetic activity after paroxetine treatment.

abstract = {This study evaluated the effects of propranolol on recovery of heart rate variability (HRV) after acute myocardial infarction and its relation to outcome in the Beta-blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT). Beta blockers improve mortality after acute myocardial infarction, but through an unknown mechanism. Depressed HRV, a measure of autonomic tone, predicts mortality after acute myocardial infarction. Whether $\beta$ blockers influence recovery of HRV after acute myocardial infarction, and thereby improve outcome, is unknown. We compared 24-hour HRV parameters at 1 week after acute myocardial infarction and after 6 weeks of treatment with propanolol (n = 88) or placebo (n = 96). The relation between 25-month outcome (death/acute myocardial infarction/congestive heart failure), propranolol treatment, and HRV was further analyzed. After 6 weeks, high-frequency (HF) power (log-normalized), an index of vagal tone, increased more in propranolol-treated patients (4.28 ± 0.1 to 5.17 ± 0.09 ms2) than in placebo-treated patients (4.26 ± 0.09 to 4.77 ± 0.1 ms2, p {\textless}0.05). Sympathovagal balance measured by the low-frequency (LF) to HF ratio increased in placebo-treated patients (3.55 ± 0.24 to 3.86 ± 0.24) but decreased in those treated with propranolol (3.76 ± 0.29 to 3.17 ± 0.23, p {\textless}0.01). Other frequency-domain parameters increased over time but were not affected by propranolol. Propranolol blunted the morning increase in the LF/HF ratio. Recovery of HF, the strongest HRV predictor of outcome, and propranolol therapy independently predicted outcome. In summary, after acute myocardial infarction, propranolol therapy improves recovery of parasympathetic tone, which correlates with improved outcome, and decreases morning sympathetic predominance. These findings may elucidate the mechanisms by which $\beta$ blockers decrease mortality and reduce the early morning risk of sudden death after acute myocardial infarction. {\textcopyright} 2003 by Excerpta Medica, Inc.},

abstract = {Autonomic neuropathy is associated with poor prognosis. Cardiovascular reflexes are essential for the diagnosis of autonomic nerve dysfunction. Blood pressure response to standing is the most simple test for the evaluation of sympathetic integrity, however it is still discussed which diagnostic criteria of abnormal response should be considered as optimal. The EURODIAB IDDM Complications Study involved the examination of randomly selected Type 1 diabetic patients from 31 centres in 16 European counties. Data from 3007 patients were available for the present evaluation. Two tests of autonomic function (response of heart rate /R-R ratio/ and blood pressure from lying to standing) just as the frequency of feeling faint on standing up were assessed. R-R ratio was abnormal in 24{\%} of patients. According to different diagnostic criteria of abnormal BP response to standing ({\textgreater}30 mmHg, {\textgreater}20 mmHg, and {\textgreater}10 mmHg fall in systolic BP), the frequency of abnormal results was 5.9{\%}, 18{\%} and 32{\%}, respectively (p {\textless} 0.001). The frequency of feeling faint on standing was 18{\%}, thus, it was identical with the prevalence of abnormal blood pressure response to standing when {\textgreater}20 mmHg fall in systolic blood pressure was considered as abnormal. Feeling faint on standing correlated significantly with both autonomic test results (p {\textless} 0.001). A fall {\textgreater}20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure after standing up seems to be the most reliable criterion for the assessment of orthostatic hypotension in the diagnosis of autonomic neuropathy in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus.},

Within-subjects changes in these measures were assessed in 36 subjects during different postures and (paced) respiratory frequencies. Changes from supine to sitting to standing led to reduced RSA values and longer pre-ejection periods, reflecting the known decrease in vagal but not the increase of sympathetic activity. Multilevel path analysis showed that within-subjects changes in sympatho-vagal balance were faithfully reflected by changes in interbeat interval, but imperfectly by changes in RSA and pre-ejection period. It was concluded that pre-ejection period should be stratified for posture and RSA for respiratory frequency to reliably index changes in sympatho-vagal balance when these factors are prone to change (e.g., during 24-h ambulatory recording).},

Measurements were made in 14 non-diabetic control subjects and 52 diabetic patients, 30 of whom had evidence of peripheral neuropathy. All the measurements were significantly reduced in the feet of patients with neuropathy. Vasoconstrictor responses were not significantly impaired in the hands of these patients. Cardiovascular autonomic function was assessed in the same subjects by standard tests of reflex heart rate responses and compared to sympathetic vasoconstrictor function as determined by the response to a deep breath. Eighteen of the 30 diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy had impairment of both cardiovascular and sympathetic vasoconstrictor function. Five had normal vasoconstrictor but impaired cardiovascular responses and two had normal cardiovascular but impaired vasoconstrictor function.

abstract = {Exposure to combat experiences is associated with increased risk of developing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Prolonged exposure therapy and cognitive processing therapy have garnered a significant amount of empirical support for PTSD treatment; however, they are not universally effective with some patients continuing to struggle with residual PTSD symptoms. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a measure of the autonomic nervous system functioning and reflects an individual's ability to adaptively cope with stress. A pilot study was undertaken to determine if veterans with PTSD (as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale and the PTSD Checklist) would show significantly different HRV prior to an intervention at baseline compared to controls; specifically, to determine whether the HRV among veterans with PTSD is more depressed than that among veterans without PTSD. The study also aimed at assessing the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of providing HRV biofeedback as a treatment for PTSD. The findings suggest that implementing an HRV biofeedback as a treatment for PTSD is effective, feasible, and acceptable for veterans. Veterans with combat-related PTSD displayed significantly depressed HRV as compared to subjects without PTSD. When the veterans with PTSD were randomly assigned to receive either HRV biofeedback plus treatment as usual (TAU) or just TAU, the results indicated that HRV biofeedback significantly increased the HRV while reducing symptoms of PTSD. However, the TAU had no significant effect on either HRV or symptom reduction. A larger randomized control trial to validate these findings appears warranted.

abstract = {The objective of this study was to test prospectively in a population sample whether individuals with impaired heart rate variability (HRV) are at increased risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) and of non-CHD mortality and to test whether this relationship is more pronounced among individuals with diabetes. We examined the association between HRV and incident CHD and non-CHD mortality in a cohort of 11,654 men and women aged 45-64 years at intake, from the biracial, population-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. Supine, resting, 2-min beat-to-beat heart rate data were collected at the baseline examination. High frequency (HF; 0.15-0.40 Hz) and low frequency (LF; 0.04-0.15 Hz) spectral powers, LF/HF ratio, normalized HF and LF, the standard deviation of all normal R-R intervals (SDNN), and the mean of the sum of the squared differences between adjacent normal R-R intervals (MSSD) were used as the conventional indexes of HRV to measure cardiac autonomic control. From this cohort, 635 cases of incident CHD (including 346 cases of incident myocardial infarction [MI] and 82 cases of fatal CHD), and 623 non-CHD deaths were identified and validated after an average of 8 years of follow-up. Among individuals with diabetes, the multivariable adjusted proportional hazards ratios (95{\%} CI) were 2.03 (1.28-3.23), 1.60 (1.12-2.27), 1.50 (0.65-3.42), and 1.27 (0.84-1.91) for incident MI, incident CHD, fatal CHD, and non-CHD deaths, respectively, comparing the lowest quartile to the upper most three quartiles of HF. A similar pattern of associations was found for LF, SDNN, and MSSD. By contrast, there was no consistent pattern of associations among individuals without diabetes. At the population level, a lower HRV (reflective of impaired cardiac autonomic control) is statistically significantly related to the development of CHD among individuals with diabetes, independent of markers of the duration/severity of the glucose metabolism impairment. These data suggest a contribution of an impaired cardiac autonomic control to the risk of CHD among individuals with diabetes},

abstract = {AIMS: The aim of this study involves the early identification, among apparently healthy individuals, of those at high risk for sudden cardiac death. We tested the hypothesis that individuals who respond to mild mental stress in preparation for exercise test with the largest heart rate increases might be at highest risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from 7746 civil servants participating in the Paris Prospective Study I, followed-up for 23 years, allowed to compare heart rate changes between rest and mild mental stress (preparation prior to an exercise test) between subjects who suffered sudden cardiac death (n = 81), non-sudden (n = 129) coronary death, or death from any cause (n = 1306). The mean heart rate increase during mild mental stress was 8.9 +/- 10.8 b.p.m. Risk of sudden cardiac death increased progressively with heart rate increase during mental stress and the relative risk of the third vs. the first tertile was 2.09 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.13-3.86) after adjustment for confounders. This relationship was not observed for non-sudden coronary death. CONCLUSION: An important heart rate increase produced by a mild mental stress predicts long-term risk for sudden cardiac death. Heart rate changes before an exercise test may provide a simple tool for risk stratification.},

Studies of medically well, depressed psychiatric patients have found elevated levels of plasma catecholamines and other markers of altered ANS function compared with controls. Studies of depressed patients with CHD have also uncovered evidence of ANS dysfunction, including elevated heart rate, low heart rate variability, exaggerated heart rate responses to physical stressors, high variability in ventricular repolarization, and low baroreceptor sensitivity. All of these indicators of ANS dysfunction have been associated with increased risks of mortality and cardiac morbidity in patients with CHD. Further research is needed to determine whether ANS dysfunction mediates the effects of depression on the course and outcome of CHD, and to develop clinical interventions that improve cardiovascular autonomic regulation while relieving depression in patients with CHD.},

abstract = {Background: Both race and social class influence cardiovascular outcomes, through mechanisms not yet fully understood. Minority race and lower social class are sources of chronic stress, which can alter autonomic nervous system function. Heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function, is also an important predictor of cardiovascular outcomes. Methods: To determine whether minority race/ethnicity and lower social class are associated with depressed HRV, we prospectively collected data on sociodemographic, clinical, psychological, and behavioral factors by survey in 360 outpatients undergoing ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Heart rate variability (24-hour) was measured by frequency domain analysis. Results: In unadjusted analysis, African Americans had lower HRV than whites, and individuals of lower social class as measured by education, occupation, and income had lower HRV than those of higher class. In multivariable analysis, both race and social class were independent predictors of ultralow frequency power after controlling for clinical and psychological factors. African Americans were 3.45 (95{\%} CI 1.74-6.98, P = .0004) times as likely as whites to have depressed HRV (ultralow frequency power, lowest tertile), and non-college graduates 2.94 (95{\%} CI, 1.71-5.14, P = .0001) times as likely as college graduates to have depressed HRV. Conclusions: Heart rate variability is lower in African Americans and individuals of lower social class, independent of the effects of measured clinical, psychological, or behavioral factors. This suggests that the adverse effects of minority race and lower social class on cardiovascular outcomes may be mediated by dysregulation of autonomic function. {\textcopyright} 2005, Mosby, Inc.

abstract = {Many experimental and clinical studies have confirmed a continuous cross-talk between both sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of autonomic nervous system and inflammatory response, in different clinical scenarios. In cardiovascular diseases, inflammation has been proven to play a pivotal role in disease progression, pathogenesis and resolution. A few clinical studies have assessed the possible inter-relation between neuro-autonomic output, estimated with heart rate variability analysis, which is the variability of R-R in the electrocardiogram, and different inflammatory biomarkers, in patients suffering from stable or unstable coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure. Moreover, different indices derived from heart rate signals' processing, have been proven to correlate strongly with severity of heart disease and predict final outcome. In this review article we will summarize major findings from different investigators, evaluating neuro-immunological interactions through heart rate variability analysis, in different groups of cardiovascular patients. We suggest that markers originating from variability analysis of heart rate signals seem to be related to inflammatory biomarkers. However, a lot of open questions remain to be addressed, regarding the existence of a true association between heart rate variability and autonomic nervous system output or its adoption for risk stratification and therapeutic monitoring at the bedside. Finally, potential therapeutic implications will be discussed, leading to autonomic balance restoration in relation with inflammatory control.},

abstract = {Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is one of the most severe complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this study was to investigate associations of cardiac sympathetic dysinnervation (CSD; by (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy) with short-term heart rate variability (HRV) measured by traditional vs. complexity markers. ECG was measured in 31 diabetic patients during rest over a period of 5 minutes and HRV quantified in different domains (time and frequency domain, scaling properties, symbolic dynamics). (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy identified 16 patients with CSD. Resting heart rate was increased and HRV reduced in these patients. In a subgroup of 16 patients ECG was also measured during standing. Changes in several HRV measures upon standing demonstrated cardiac responsiveness to orthostatic stress. Strong correlations between HRV, measured during standing, and CSD were observed with metrics based on symbolic dynamics. In conclusion, HRV assessment during standing may be useful for assessing cardiac sympathetic dysinnervation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim was to evaluate differences in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, indexed by heart rate variability (HRV) in apparently healthy subjects with self-reported symptoms of pain (SRSP) within an exploratory analysis. METHODS: HRV data from 14 apparently healthy male individuals were analyzed to address potential differences in subjects with and without SRSP. SRSP was assessed using the four pain-related items from the symptom checklist (SCL-90R). Subjects were stratified based on the presence of SRSP. RESULTS: Parasympathetic activity, indexed by pNN50, RMSSD, and high frequency (HF) spectrum of HRV, was lower in subjects with SRSP. Low frequency (LF) HRV and the LF/HF ratio were greater in subjects with SRSP. However, analysis of variance revealed no significant differences between the groups. Pearson correlations showed a correlation of pNN50, HF, LF, and LF/HF ratio and the presence and frequency of SRSP. Measures of parasympathetic activity (pNN50 and HF) were inversely associated with more SRSP, indicating that subjects with more frequent SRSP show decreased parasympathetic activity. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with evidence on changes in HRV in patients with clinical conditions of chronic or recurrent pain, this is the first study to show that healthy individuals who report symptoms of pain may have lower parasympathetic activity revealed by measures of HRV.},

abstract = {Background: Decreased vagal activity after myocardial infarction results in reduced heart-rate variability and increased risk of death. To distinguish between vagal and sympathetic factors that affect heart-rate variability, we used a signal-processing algorithm to separately characterise deceleration and acceleration of heart rate. We postulated that diminished deceleration-related modulation of heart rate is an important prognostic marker. Our prospective hypotheses were that deceleration capacity is a better predictor of risk than left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN). Methods: We quantified heart rate deceleration capacity by assessing 24-h Holter recordings from a post-infarction cohort in Munich (n=1455). We blindly validated the prognostic power of deceleration capacity in post-infarction populations in London, UK (n=656), and Oulu, Finland (n=600). We tested our hypotheses by assessment of the area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve (AUC). Findings: During a median follow-up of 24 months, 70 people died in the Munich cohort and 66 in the London cohort. The Oulu cohort was followed-up for 38 months and 77 people died. In the London cohort, mean AUC of deceleration capacity was 0{\textperiodcentered}80 (SD 0{\textperiodcentered}03) compared with 0{\textperiodcentered}67 (0{\textperiodcentered}04) for LVEF and 0{\textperiodcentered}69 (0{\textperiodcentered}04) for SDNN. In the Oulu cohort, mean AUC of deceleration capacity was 0{\textperiodcentered}74 (0{\textperiodcentered}03) compared with 0{\textperiodcentered}60 (0{\textperiodcentered}04) for LVEF and 0{\textperiodcentered}64 (0{\textperiodcentered}03) for SDNN (p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001 for all comparisons). Stratification by dichotomised deceleration capacity was especially powerful in patients with preserved LVEF (p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001 in all cohorts). Interpretation: Impaired heart rate deceleration capacity is a powerful predictor of mortality after myocardial infarction and is more accurate than LVEF and the conventional measures of heart-rate variability. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Depression is common in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and is a risk factor for cardiac morbidity and mortality in these patients. Depression is associated with autonomic nervous system dysfunction, which may at least partially explain this increased risk. Low heart rate variability (HRV), which reflects excessive sympathetic and/or inadequate parasympathetic modulation of heart rate, is a strong predictor of mortality in patients with CHD. Most studies-both in patients with stable CHD and in patients with a recent acute coronary event-have found HRV to be lower in depressed patients than in their nondepressed counterparts. This manuscript provides an overview of this literature and concludes that HRV may account for a substantial part of the risk associated with depression in CHD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Recently we showed the predictive value of sum absolute QRST integral (SAI QRST) and repolarization lability for risk stratification of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in heart failure patients. The goal of this study was to compare SAI QRST and metrics of depolarization and repolarization variability in healthy men and women.

METHODS:Orthogonal ECGs were recorded at rest for 10 minutes in 160 healthy men and women (mean age 39.6±14.6, 80 men). Mean spatial TT' angle, and normalized variances of T loop area, of spatial T vector amplitude, of QT interval and Tpeak-Tend area were measured for assessment of repolarization lability. Normalized variances of spatial QRS vector and QRS loop area characterized variability of depolarization. In addition, variability indices (VI) were calculated to adjust for normalized heart rate variance. SAI QRST was measured as the averaged arithmetic sum of areas under the QRST curve.

RESULTS:Men were characterized by shorter QTc (430.3±21.7 vs. 444.7±22.2 ms; P{\textless}0.0001) and larger SAI QRST (282.1±66.7 vs. 204.9±58.5 mV*ms; P{\textless}0.0001). Repolarization lability negatively correlated with spatial T vector amplitude. Adjusted by normalized heart rate variance, QT variability index was significantly higher in women than in men (-1.54±0.38 vs. -1.70±0.33; P = 0.017). However, in multivariate logistic regression after adjustment for body surface area, QTc, and spatial T vector amplitude, healthy men had 1.5-3 fold higher probability of having larger repolarization lability, as compared to healthy women (T vector amplitude variability index odds ratio 3.88 (95{\%}CI 1.4-11.1; P = 0.012).

CONCLUSIONS:Healthy men more likely than women have larger repolarization lability.},

abstract = {Background: Schizophrenia is associated with increased cardiac mortality. A disturbed autonomic modulation of heart rate (HR) has been described in patients with schizophrenia in whom antipsychotic medication may represent an additional cardiac risk. The novel measure deceleration capacity (DC) of heart rate predicts cardiac mortality in patients with cardiovascular illnesses. The aim of the present paper was to calculate DC in patients with schizophrenia and to compare this measure with established parameters of heart rate variability (HRV). Methods: HRV and DC were calculated in 24-hour electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of 20 unmedicated, 40 medicated patients with schizophrenia and 40 controls. As activity has a major influence on HRV, 4-hour periods of " sleep-" and " wake-" ECG were evaluated as additional parameters. Actigraphy was used to ensure comparable levels of activity in patients and controls. Results: The DC as well as the other established HRV measures were not significantly different comparing unmedicated patients with schizophrenia to healthy controls. However, medicated patients showed a significant reduction of DC calculated from ECG recordings during 4. hour over night periods. Conclusion: Calculation of DC might contribute to a better monitoring and identification of an increased risk of cardiac mortality in patients with schizophrenia undergoing antipsychotic treatment. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

Reduced HRV, a measure of autonomic dysfunction, has been linked to depression but many studies have inadequately controlled for familial and environmental factors. Furthermore, little is known about whether depression and HRV share common genetic pathways.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We performed power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms in 288 middle-aged male twins. Log-normalized ultra low, very low, low, high frequency, and total power were calculated. A lifetime history of major depressive disorder (MDD) was determined, using the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders, and current depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory. Mixed-effect regression models were used to account for intrapair variability and estimate within-pair effects at the same time controlling for potential confounders.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Both current depressive symptoms and a history of MDD were significantly associated with lower HRV. There was a graded effect, and power in each frequency band was 29{\%} to 36{\%} lower in the lowest band compared with the highest BDI category. All HRV measures except high frequency remained significantly associated with current depressive symptoms in multivariable analysis, but not with lifetime history of MDD. When analyses were stratified by zygosity, a significant within-pair association between BDI score and HRV was found in the dizygotic but not in the monozygotic twins, suggesting a genetic influence on the association.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: A shared, genetically influenced biological pathway underlies the association between depression and lower HRV. These two phenotypes may be the expression of a generalized neurobiological perturbation.},

Resting, supine, 2-minute, beat-to-beat heart rate data were collected between 7 A.M. and 12 noon. The race- and sexadjusted geometric means of low-frequency component (If, 0.025 to 0.15 Hz) were 4.00 and 3.13 (beats/min)2; of high-frequency component (HF, 0.16 to 0.35 Hz), 1.65 and 1.21 (beats/min)2; and of the HF LF ratio, 0.41 and 0.39, for 45-to-54 and 55-to-64 years age groups, respectively (test of mean difference by age, p {\textless} 0.01, p {\textless} 0.01, and p = 0.11 for if, HF, and HF LF ratio, respectively). Comparing black with white examinees, the age- and sex-adjusted geometric means of LF were 3.06 and 3.70 (beats/min)2; of HF, 1.66 and 1.36 (beats/min)2; of HF LF, 0.54 and 0.37, respectively (test of mean difference by race, p {\textless} 0.01, p {\textless} 0.01, and p {\textless} 0.01). The age- and race-adjusted geometric means of LF for women and men were 3.12 and 4.10 (beats/min)2; of HF, 1.46 and 1.38 (beats/min)2; and of HF LF, 0.47 and 0.34, respectively (test of mean difference, p {\textless} 0.01, p = 0.34, and p {\textless} 0.01). We conclude that HRV spectral indexes are associated with age, race, and sex. With increasing age, the parasympathetic and sympathetic spectral power components decrease. Black examinees have a lower LF, higher HF, and higher HF LF ratio than whites. Women have a lower LF, and a higher HF LF ratio than men. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Risk stratification by means of analysis of QT dispersion (QTD) in the 12-lead surface ECG is under intense investigation in various patient populations. The aim of the present prospective study was to evaluate the prognostic value of QTD and other ECG variables reflecting dispersion of ventricular repolarization in comparison with established risk stratifiers during long-term follow-up in a large cohort of post-myocardial infarction patients treated according to contemporary therapeutic guidelines. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 280 consecutive infarct survivors, the 12-lead ECG was optically scanned and digitized for analysis of QTD (QTmax-QTmin) and 25 other repolarization variables, including recently developed and validated parameters such as the T peak-to-T end interval and the area under the T wave. In addition, a variety of established risk stratifiers were assessed. After a mean follow-up period of 32+/-10 months, 30 patients reached one of the prospectively defined study end points (death, ventricular tachycardia, or resuscitated ventricular fibrillation). Comparisons between event and nonevent patients by means of Kaplan-Meier event probability analyses revealed that none of the ECG dispersion variables were of discriminative value. In contrast, variables such as left ventricular ejection fraction (P=0.007), mean 24-hour heart rate (P=0.022), or heart rate variability (P=0.007) proved to be potentially useful risk stratifiers in this patient population. On multivariate analysis, only LVEF, heart rate variability, and a history of thrombolysis were independent predictors of outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Determination of QTD from the surface ECG even when performed with the best available methodology failed to predict subsequent risk in this large series of infarct survivors.},

abstract = {Elevated psychosocial stress might favor the occurrence of cardiovascular disease; however, mechanisms are incompletely understood. We hypothesized that patients (n=126; 44+/-1 years of age) referred to an internal medicine clinic because of symptoms related to chronic psychosocial stress would demonstrate signs of autonomic dysregulation compared with controls (n=132; 42+/-1 years of age). We used autoregressive spectral analysis of RR interval variability to obtain indirect markers of sympathetic and of vagal (respectively, low-frequency and high-frequency components, both expressed in normalized units) oscillatory modulation of sinoatrial node, as well as of sympathetic vasomotor regulation (low-frequency component of systolic arterial pressure variability) and of cardiac baroreflex sensitivity (alpha-index). Higher values of systolic and diastolic arterial pressure (respectively, 124+/-1 versus 117+/-1 mm Hg and 80+/-1 versus 75+/-1 mm Hg; both P{\textless}0.001), altered markers of autonomic regulation (increased normalized low-frequency and reduced high-frequency component of RR variability, P{\textless}0.005; increased-low frequency component of systolic arterial pressure variability, P{\textless}0.002), and reduced baroreflex sensitivity (19.3+/-1.4 versus 23.0+/-2.0 ms/mm Hg; P{\textless}0.05) were observed in patients compared with controls. Autonomic responses to active standing were also blunted in stressed patients. Autonomic markers were significantly correlated to stress perception score and were capable of discriminating between controls and patients with a high degree of accuracy. Chronic real-life stress in humans appears associated to increased arterial pressure and to impaired autonomic regulation of cardiovascular functions. The combination of sympathetic predominance, vagal withdrawal, and blunted baroreflex sensitivity might represent a treatable mechanistic link between psychosocial factors and future incidence of hypertension.},

abstract = {Background. Experimental evidence suggests that autonomic markers such as heart-rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) may contribute to post-infarction risk stratification. There are clinical data to support this concept for heart-rate variability. The main objective of the ATRAMI study was to provide prospective data on the additional and independent prognostic value for cardiac mortality of heart-rate variability and BRS in patients after myocardial infarction in whom left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and ventricular arrhythmias were known. Methods. This multicentre international prospective study enrolled 1284 patients with a recent ({\textless} 28 days) myocardial infarction, 24 h Holter recording was done to quantify heart-rate variability (measured as standard deviation of normal to normal RR intervals [SDNN]) and ventricular arrhythmias. BRS was calculated from measurement of the rate-pressure response to intravenous phenylephrine. Findings. During 21 (SD 8) months of follow-up, the primary endpoint, cardiac mortality, included 44 cardiac deaths and five non-fatal cardiac arrests. Low values of either heart-rate variability (SDNN {\textless} 70 ms) or BRS ({\textless} 3.0 ms per mmHg) carried a significant multivariate risk of cardiac mortality (3.2 [95{\%} CI 1.42-7.36] and 2.8 [1.24-6.16], respectively). The association of low SDNN and BRS further increased risk; the 2-year mortality was 17{\%} when both were below the cut-offs and 2{\%} (p {\textless} 0.0001) when both were well preserved (SDNN {\textgreater} 105 ms, BRS {\textgreater} 6.1 ms per mmHg). The association of low SDNN or BRS with LVEF below 35{\%} carried a relative risk of 6.7 (3.1-14.6) or 8.7 (4.3-17.6), respectively, compared with patients with LVEF above 35{\%} and less compromised SDNN ≤ 70 ms) and BRS (≤ 3 ms per mmHg). Interpretation. ATRAMI provides clinical evidence that after myocardial infarction the analysis of vagal reflexes has significant prognostic value independently of LVEF and of ventricular arrhythmias acid that it significantly adds to the prognostic value of heart-rate variability.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. The serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) is a key candidate gene for depression. We examined the association between SLC6A4 promoter methylation variation and depressive symptoms using 84 monozygotic twin pairs. METHODS: DNA methylation level in the SLC6A4 promoter region was quantified by bisulfite pyrosequencing using genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes. The number of current depressive symptoms was assessed using the Beck Depressive Inventory II (BDI-II). The association between methylation variation and depressive symptoms was examined using matched twin-pair analyses, adjusting for body mass index, smoking, physical activity, and alcohol consumption. Multiple testing was controlled by adjusted false discovery rate (q value). RESULTS: Intrapair difference in DNA methylation variation at 10 of the 20 studied CpG sites is significantly correlated with intrapair difference in BDI scores. Linear regression using intrapair differences demonstrates that intrapair difference in BDI score was significantly associated with intrapair differences in DNA methylation variation after adjusting for potential confounders and correction for multiple testing. On average, a 10{\%} increase in the difference in mean DNA methylation level was associated with 4.4 increase in the difference in BDI score (95{\%} confidence interval = 0.9-7.9, p = .01). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that variation in methylation level within the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene is associated with variation in depressive symptoms in a large sample of monozygotic twin pairs. This relationship is not confounded by genetic and shared environment. The 5-HTTLPR genotype also does not modulate this association.},

In the inflammatory reflex, sensory input elicited by infection or injury travels through the afferent vagus nerve to integrative regions in the brainstem, and efferent nerves carry outbound signals that terminate in the spleen and other tissues. Neurotransmitters from peripheral autonomic nerves subsequently promote acetylcholine-release from a subset of CD4 + T cells that relay the neural signal to other immune cells, e.g. through activation of a7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on macrophages. Here, we review recent progress in the understanding of the inflammatory reflex and dis-cuss potential therapeutic implications of current findings in this evolving field.},

The present study was designed to investigate the effect of age upon heart rate variability at rest and in response to a single deep breath, the Valsalva manoeuvre, and standing. A computerised method of measurement of R-R interval variation was used to study heart rate responses in 310 healthy subjects aged 18-85 years. Heart rate variation during each procedure showed a skewed distribution and a statistically significant negative correlation with age. Normal ranges (90{\%} and 95{\%} confidence limits) for subjects aged 20-75 years were calculated for heart rate difference (max-min) and ratio (max/min) and standard deviation (SD). Heart rate responses were less than the 95th centile in at least one of the four procedures in 39 (12.6{\%}) out of the 310 subjects, and were below this limit in two or more tests in five (1.6{\%}) subjects. In view of the decline in heart rate variation with increasing age, normal ranges for tests of autonomic function must be related to the age of the subject.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV), the beat-to-beat variation in either heart rate or the duration of the R-R interval - the heart period, has become a popular clinical and investigational tool. The temporal fluctuations in heart rate exhibit a marked synchrony with respiration (increasing during inspiration and decreasing during expiration - the so called respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA) and are widely believed to reflect changes in cardiac autonomic regulation. Although the exact contributions of the parasympathetic and the sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system to this variability are controversial and remain the subject of active investigation and debate, a number of time and frequency domain techniques have been developed to provide insight into cardiac autonomic regulation in both health and disease. It is the purpose of this essay to provide an historical overview of the evolution in the concept of HRV. Briefly, pulse rate was first measured by ancient Greek physicians and scientists. However, it was not until the invention of the "Physician's Pulse Watch" (a watch with a second hand that could be stopped) in 1707 that changes in pulse rate could be accurately assessed. The Rev. Stephen Hales (1733) was the first to note that pulse varied with respiration and in 1847 Carl Ludwig was the first to record RSA. With the measurement of the ECG (1895) and advent of digital signal processing techniques in the 1960s, investigation of HRV and its relationship to health and disease has exploded. This essay will conclude with a brief description of time domain, frequency domain, and non-linear dynamic analysis techniques (and their limitations) that are commonly used to measure HRV.},

abstract = {Introduction: Mental stress ischemia (MSI) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular outcomes and death in CAD patients, but little is known about the mechanisms behind this phenomenon. We hypothesized that alterations in autonomic function before, during, or after mental stress may play a role. We examined whether MSI positive patients with CAD have reduced parasympathetic (PNS) tone, as measured by high frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV), as well as reduced baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS), as approximated by low frequency (LF) HRV at baseline, peak mental stress, and recovery.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nMethods: A mental stress test with a standardized speech stressor was performed in 425 CAD patients wearing an ambulatory ECG monitor. Myocardial perfusion imaging was performed with TC-99m Sestamibi. After careful editing for artifacts and ectopic beats, HF HRV and LF HRV were measured for 5-min periods during a baseline rest period, 5 min of speech, and 5 min of recovery. Logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounders.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nResults: The mean (SD) age was 63 (9) years, 26{\%} were women, and 30{\%} were African American; 42 (10{\%}) patients developed MSI. Compared with MSI negative, MSI positive patients had lower HF HRV and LF HRV during rest, stress, and recovery. The largest difference was observed during stress; HF HRV was 46{\%} lower (p=0.01), and LF HRV was 44{\%} lower (p=0.01). When examining reactivity to stress (difference between stress and rest), only LF HRV was significantly different between groups, such that MSI positive patients had an average 32{\%} reduction in LF HRV with stress, while MSI negative patients had an average 3{\%} increase (p=0.04). LF HRV reactivity remained an independent predictor of MSI (p=0.01) in models adjusting for sociodemographics, traditional risk factors, antidepressants, beta-blocker use, revascularization history, heart failure, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and heart rate/blood pressure reactivity.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nConclusions: Autonomic factors, most notably reduced LF HRV reactivity, predict MSI in CAD patients. This implies reduced BRS and autonomic inflexibility as an important pathophysiological component of the ischemic response to mental stress.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart failure is associated with frequent hospitalizations, often resulting from volume overload. Measurement of intrathoracic impedance with an implanted device with an audible patient alert may detect increases in pulmonary fluid retention early. We hypothesized that early intervention could prevent hospitalizations and affect outcome. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 335 patients with chronic heart failure who had undergone implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator alone (18{\%}) or with cardiac resynchronization therapy (82{\%}). All devices featured a monitoring tool to track changes in intrathoracic impedance (OptiVol) and other diagnostic parameters. Patients were randomized to have information available to physicians and patients as an audible alert in case of preset threshold crossings (access arm) or not (control arm). The primary end point was a composite of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalizations. During 14.9±5.4 months, this occurred in 48 patients (29{\%}) in the access arm and in 33 patients (20{\%}) in the control arm (P=0.063; hazard ratio, 1.52; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.97-2.37). This was due mainly to more heart failure hospitalizations (hazard ratio, 1.79; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.08-2.95; P=0.022), whereas the number of deaths was comparable (19 versus 15; P=0.54). The number of outpatient visits was higher in the access arm (250 versus 84; P{\textless}0.0001), with relatively more signs of heart failure among control patients during outpatient visits. Although the trial was terminated as a result of slow enrollment, a post hoc futility analysis indicated that a positive result would have been unlikely. CONCLUSION: Use of an implantable diagnostic tool to measure intrathoracic impedance with an audible patient alert did not improve outcome and increased heart failure hospitalizations and outpatient visits in heart failure patients.

abstract = {We investigated a neural reflex that controls the strength of inflammatory responses to immune challenge - the inflammatory reflex. In anaesthetized rats challenged with intravenous lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 60 mug kg(-1)), we found strong increases in plasma levels of the key inflammatory mediator tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) 90 min later. Those levels were unaffected by previous bilateral cervical vagotomy, but were enhanced approximately 5-fold if the greater splanchnic sympathetic nerves had been cut. Sham surgery had no effect, and plasma corticosterone levels were unaffected by nerve sections, so could not explain this result. Electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that efferent neural activity in the splanchnic nerve and its splenic branch was strongly increased by LPS treatment. Splenic nerve activity was dependent on inputs from the splanchnic nerves: vagotomy had no effect on the activity in either nerve. Together, these data demonstrate that immune challenge with this dose of LPS activates a neural reflex that is powerful enough to cause an 80{\%} suppression of the acute systemic inflammatory response. The efferent arm of this reflex is in the splanchnic sympathetic nerves, not the vagi as previously proposed. As with other physiological responses to immune challenge, the afferent pathway is presumptively humoral: the present data show that vagal afferents play no measurable part. Because inflammation sits at the gateway to immune responses, this reflex could play an important role in immune function as well as inflammatory diseases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data on the value of baseline brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and autonomic markers in predicting heart failure (HF) hospitalization after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are limited. METHODS: A consecutive series of patients with AMI without a previous history of HF (n = 569) were followed up for 8 years. At baseline, the patients had a blood sample for determination of BNP, a 24-hour Holter recording for evaluating heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate turbulence (HRT), and an assessment of baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) using phenylephrine test. RESULTS: During the follow-up, 79 (14{\%}) patients were hospitalized due to HF. Increased baseline BNP, decreased HRV, HRT, and BRS had a significant association with HF hospitalization in univariate comparisons (P {\textless} 0.001 for all). After adjusting with all the relevant clinical parameters, BNP, HRV, and HRT still significantly predicted HF hospitalization (P {\textless} 0.001 for BNP and for the short-term scaling exponent alpha(1), P {\textless} 0.01 for turbulence slope). In the receiver operator characteristics curve analysis, the area under the curve for BNP was 0.77, for the short-term scaling exponent alpha(1) 0.69, for turbulence slope 0.71, and for BNP/standard deviation of all N-N intervals ratio 0.80. CONCLUSION: Baseline increased BNP and impaired autonomic function after AMI yield significant information on the long-term risk for HF hospitalization.},

abstract = {An increasing number of studies has tested whether greater cardiovascular responses to acute mental stress predict future cardiovascular disease, but results have been variable. This review aimed quantitatively to evaluate the association between cardiovascular responses to laboratory mental stress and subsequent cardiovascular risk status in prospective cohort studies. We searched general bibliographic databases, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and PubMed, up to December 2009. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, quality, and estimates of associations. There were 169 associations (36 articles) of stress reactivity and 30 associations (5 articles) of poststress recovery in relation to future cardiovascular risk status, including elevated blood pressure, hypertension, left ventricular mass, subclinical atherosclerosis, and clinical cardiac events. The overall meta-analyses showed that greater reactivity to and poor recovery from stress were associated longitudinally with poor cardiovascular status (r=0.091 [95{\%} CI: 0.050 to 0.132], P{\textless}0.001, and r=0.096 [95{\%} CI: 0.058 to 0.134], P{\textless}0.001, respectively). These findings were supported by more conservative analyses of aggregate effects and by subgroup analyses of the methodologically strong associations. Notably, incident hypertension and increased carotid intima-media thickness were more consistently predicted by greater stress reactivity and poor stress recovery, respectively, whereas both factors were associated with higher future systolic and diastolic blood pressures. In conclusion, the current meta-analysis suggests that greater responsivity to acute mental stress has an adverse effect on future cardiovascular risk status, supporting the use of methods of managing stress responsivity in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease.},

However, it has recently been argued that low or blunted reactivity is also associated with negative health outcomes. As such, in this special issue we present further evidence implicating that cardiovascular and stress hormone responses to acute stress at the other end of the response spectrum can also be considered a pathway to ill health. In this introductory article, we explore and review the origins of and potential mechanisms underlying blunted responses to acute stress. In so doing, we aim to highlight: what is currently known regarding this new conceptualization of the reactivity hypothesis; the potential explanations for blunted reactivity; the pathways underlying associations with health outcomes; and where this field is headed in terms of developing our understanding of the link between reactivity and health. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The present study examined associations among severity of lifetime victimization, current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and heart rate (AHR) levels and variability. Thirty-nine healthy post-menopausal women who endorsed a history of criminal victimization completed a measure of PTSD symptom severity and participated in an average of 18 h of ambulatory cardiovascular monitoring. PTSD symptom clusters were associated with AHR. Symptom clusters and lifetime victimization severity jointly predicted ABP, with ABP the highest among severely victimized women with high levels of current intrusions.

HRV is a measure of cardiac autonomic functioning. METHOD: A cross-sectional comparison of 136 elderly persons with MDD and 136 non-depressed controls (matched for age and gender) recruited in family practices in the Netherlands. Depression was determined according to the DSM-IV criteria using the PRIME-MD. HRV was measured with an electrocardiogram (ECG) during a 5-minute supine rest. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses showed statistically significant decrease in HRV in MDD patients compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Older primary care patients with MDD have a reduced HRV. This may explain why depression is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality.},

abstract = {This consensus guideline was prepared on behalf of the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrocardiology and is cosponsored by the Japanese Circulation Society, the Computers in Cardiology Working Group on e-Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology, and the European Cardiac Arrhythmia Society. It discusses the electrocardiographic phenomenon of T-wave alternans (TWA) (i.e., a beat-to-beat alternation in the morphology and amplitude of the ST- segment or T-wave). This statement focuses on its physiological basis and measurement technologies and its clinical utility in stratifying risk for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Signal processing techniques including the frequency-domain Spectral Method and the time-domain Modified Moving Average method have demonstrated the utility of TWA in arrhythmia risk stratification in prospective studies in {\textgreater}12,000 patients. The majority of exercise-based studies using both methods have reported high relative risks for cardiovascular mortality and for sudden cardiac death in patients with preserved as well as depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. Studies with ambulatory electrocardiogram-based TWA analysis with Modified Moving Average method have yielded significant predictive capacity. However, negative studies with the Spectral Method have also appeared, including 2 interventional studies in patients with implantable defibrillators. Meta-analyses have been performed to gain insights into this issue. Frontiers of TWA research include use in arrhythmia risk stratification of individuals with preserved ejection fraction, improvements in predictivity with quantitative analysis, and utility in guiding medical as well as device-based therapy. Overall, although TWA appears to be a useful marker of risk for arrhythmic and cardiovascular death, there is as yet no definitive evidence that it can guide therapy. {\textcopyright} 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {The intimate connection between the brain and the heart was enunciated by Claude Bernard over 150 years ago. In our neurovisceral integration model we have tried to build on this pioneering work. In the present paper we further elaborate our model. Specifically we review recent neuroanatomical studies that implicate inhibitory GABAergic pathways from the prefrontal cortex to the amygdala and additional inhibitory pathways between the amygdala and the sympathetic and parasympathetic medullary output neurons that modulate heart rate and thus heart rate variability. We propose that the default response to uncertainty is the threat response and may be related to the well known negativity bias. We next review the evidence on the role of vagally mediated heart rate variability (HRV) in the regulation of physiological, affective, and cognitive processes. Low HRV is a risk factor for pathophysiology and psychopathology. Finally we review recent work on the genetics of HRV and suggest that low HRV may be an endophenotype for a broad range of dysfunctions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Standard heart rate variability (HRV) techniques have been questioned in the sleep and autonomic fields as imprecise measures of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. A new technique has emerged, known as phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA). PRSA is used to quantify the quasi-periodic accelerations and decelerations in short-term heart rate, an effect that is normally masked by artifacts and noise. When applied to a signal of peak-to-peak (RR) time intervals, these quasiperiodicities can be used to estimate overall vagal activity, quantified as deceleration capacity (DC) and acceleration capacity (AC). We applied the PRSA analysis to a healthy cohort (ages 21-60 yr) enrolled in a clinical sleep trial, in which ECG data during wakefulness and sleep were available. We found that DC and AC were significantly attenuated with increasing age: a 0.27 ms/yr decrease in DC and a 0.29 ms/yr increase in AC (P{\textless}0.001). However, even in the older subjects, DC values were higher then previously found in people post-myocardial infarction. We also found a drop in percentage of normal-to-normal intervals where the current interval deviated{\textgreater}50 ms from the previous interval with age, with a decrease of 0.84{\%}/yr. We did not find any differences between younger and older subjects with traditional HRV techniques, such as low-frequency or high-frequency power. Overall, the study provides normative PRSA data and suggests that PRSA is more sensitive than other HRV measurements. We propose that the decrease in DC and AC may be a sensitive marker for autonomic changes with aging. Further work will be required to determine whether the observed changes predict poorer cardiac health prognosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Arrhythmia risk stratification with regard to prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy is a completely unsolved issue in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Arrhythmia risk stratification was performed prospectively in 343 patients with IDC, including analysis of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and size by echocardiography, signal-averaged ECG, arrhythmias on Holter ECG, QTc dispersion, heart rate variability, baroreflex sensitivity, and microvolt T-wave alternans. During 52+/-21 months of follow-up, major arrhythmic events, defined as sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or sudden death, occurred in 46 patients (13{\%}). On multivariate analysis, LV ejection fraction was the only significant arrhythmia risk predictor in patients with sinus rhythm, with a relative risk of 2.3 per 10{\%} decrease of ejection fraction (95{\%} CI, 1.5 to 3.3; P=0.0001). Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on Holter was associated with a trend toward higher arrhythmia risk (RR, 1.7; 95{\%} CI, 0.9 to 3.3; P=0.11), whereas beta-blocker therapy was associated with a trend toward lower arrhythmia risk (RR, 0.6; 95{\%} CI, 0.3 to 1.2; P=0.13). In patients with atrial fibrillation, multivariate Cox analysis also identified LV ejection fraction and absence of beta-blocker therapy as the only significant arrhythmia risk predictors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Reduced LV ejection fraction and lack of beta-blocker use are important arrhythmia risk predictors in IDC, whereas signal-averaged ECG, baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate variability, and T-wave alternans do not seem to be helpful for arrhythmia risk stratification. These findings have important implications for the design of future studies evaluating prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy in IDC.},

The study was designed to assess the power of several HRV measures to predict mortality. Dyx was tested in a subset of 206 consecutive Danish patients with analysable Holter recordings. After a median follow-up of 8.5 years 70 patients had died. Of all traditional and multipole HRV parameters, reduced Dyx was the most powerful predictor of all-cause mortality (HR 2.4; CI 1.5 to 3.8; P {\textless} 0.001). After adjustment for known risk markers, such as age, diabetes, ejection fraction, previous MI and hypertension, Dyx remained an independent predictor of mortality (P = 0.02).

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis has been shown to be a predictor of sudden cardiac death and all-cause mortality in patients with cardiac disease. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether newer HRV analysis algorithms, as used by the HeartTrends device, are superior to exercise stress testing (EST) for the detection of myocardial ischemia in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: We present pilot data of the first 100 subjects enrolled in a clinical trial designed to evaluate the yield of short-term (1 hour) HRV testing for the detection of myocardial ischemia. The study population comprised subjects without known CAD referred to a tertiary medical center for EST with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). All patients underwent a 1 hour electrocardiographic acquisition for HRV analysis with a HeartTrends device prior to ESTwith MPI. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) were calculated for EST and HRV analysis, using MPI as the gold standard for the non-invasive detection of myocardial ischemia. RESULTS: In this cohort 15{\%} had a pathologic MPI result. HRV analysis showed superior sensitivity (85{\%}), PPV (50{\%}) and NPV (97{\%}) as compared to standard EST (53{\%}, 42{\%}, 90{\%}, respectively), while the specificity of the two tests was similar (86{\%} and 85{\%}, respectively). The close agreement between HRV and MPI was even more pronounced among patients {\textgreater} 65 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot data suggest that the diagnostic yield of the novel HeartTrends HRV algorithm is superior to conventional EST for the non-invasive detection of myocardial ischemia.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of sudden cardiac death increases in populations who experience disasters such as earthquakes. The physiological link between psychological stress and sudden death is unknown; one mechanism may be the direct effects of sympathetic arousal on arrhythmias. To determine whether mental stress alters the induction, rate, or termination of ventricular arrhythmias, we performed noninvasive programmed stimulation (NIPS) in patients with defibrillators and ventricular tachycardia (VT), which is known to be inducible and terminated by antitachycardia pacing, at rest and during varying states of mental arousal. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighteen patients underwent NIPS in the resting-awake state (nonsedated). Ten underwent repeat testing during mental stress (mental arithmetic and anger recall). Induced VT was faster in 5 patients (P=0.03). VT became more difficult to terminate in 5 patients during mental stress; 4 required a shock (P=0.03). There was no change in ease of induction with mental stress. There was no evidence of ischemia on ECG or continuous ejection fraction monitoring. Eight patients received a shock in the resting-awake state and did not perform mental stress. Four underwent repeat NIPS after sedation; 3 then had induced VT terminated with antitachycardia pacing. All patients with an increase in norepinephrine of {\textgreater}50{\%} had alterations in VT that required shock for termination (P{\textless}0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Mental stress alters VT cycle length and termination without evidence of ischemia. This suggests that mental stress may lead to sudden death through the facilitation of lethal ventricular arrhythmias.},

Twenty-four-hour ECG was recorded in 29 patients with panic disorder and 23 normal controls using Holter records. Data for 20 h and also 20 000 s of awake and 20 000 s of sleep periods were analyzed using spectral analysis to quantify absolute and relative heart-period variability in ultra low (ULF: {\textless} 0.0033 Hz), very low (VLF: 0.0033-0.04 Hz), low (LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz) and high (HF: 0.15-0.5 Hz) frequency bands. The patients with panic disorder had significantly lower total and absolute ULF power, which was more pronounced during sleep. The patients also had significantly lower relative ULF power and significantly higher relative LF power during sleep. There was a significant increase of relative LF power from awake to sleep period only in the patient group. The decrease in total and ULF power may increase the risk of mortality and sudden arrhythmic death in patients with panic disorder if they experience a cardiac event. The higher relative LF power during sleep also suggests a possible higher sympathetic drive in the patients during sleep.},

Twenty-minute ECG recordings were obtained every two weeks and 24-hour ECG recordings every four weeks. Exposure to PM (size range from 10 nm to 2.5 $\mu$m), and elemental (EC) and organic (OC) carbon was measured. Additive mixed models were used to analyze the association between PM and ECG recordings.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The short-term recordings showed decrements in the high-frequency component of HRV as well as in RMSSD (root-mean-square of successive differences of NN intervals) in association with increments in EC and OC 0-23 hours prior to the recordings. The long-term recordings revealed decreased RMSSD and pNN50 ({\%} of adjacent NN intervals that differed more than 50 ms) in association with EC and OC 24-47 hours prior to the recordings. In addition, highly significant effects were found for DC which decreased in association with PM2.5, EC and OC concurrent with the ECG recordings as well as with a lag of up to 47 hours.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The analysis showed significant effects of ambient particulate air pollution on DC and HRV parameters reflecting parasympathetic modulation of the heart in patients with CAD. An air pollution-related decrease in parasympathetic tone as well as impaired heart rate deceleration capacity may contribute to an increased risk for cardiac morbidity and sudden cardiac death in vulnerable populations.},

Mixed-effect regression models were used to calculate associations between and within twin pairs, while adjusting for covariates.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The mean age (standard deviation) was 55 (2.9) years. A statistically significant positive association was found between measures of HRV and verbal, but not visual, SRT scores. The most statistically significant unadjusted association was found between very low frequency HRV and verbal total recall SRT, such that each logarithm of increase in very low frequency was associated with an increased verbal SRT score of 4.85 points (p = .002). The association persisted despite the adjustment for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors, and after accounting for familial and genetic factors by comparing twins within pairs. A significant interaction was found between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and HRV, such that total power and ultra low frequency were associated with SRT in twins (n = 362) without PTSD, but not in those with PTSD.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Lower frequency spectra of HRV are associated with verbal, but not visual, learning and memory, particularly in subjects without PTSD. This association may indicate that autonomic nervous system dysregulation plays a role in cognitive decline.},

abstract = {Background: Depression is associated with an increased risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation, proinflammatory processes, and procoagulant processes have been suggested as possible explanations. Methods: Heart rate variability (HRV), an indicator of cardiac autonomic regulation, and markers of inflammation [C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$)] and coagulation (fibrinogen) were assessed in 44 depressed patients with CHD. Results: Moderate, negative correlations were found between fibrinogen and four measures of HRV. IL-6 also negatively correlated with one measure of HRV (total power) and was marginally related to two others (very low frequency and low frequency power). Neither CRP nor TNF-$\alpha$ was significantly related to any measure of HRV. Conclusions: The finding that fibrinogen and IL-6 are moderately related to HRV suggests a link between these factors in depressed CHD patients. The relationship between ANS function and inflammatory and coagulant processes should be investigated in larger mechanistic studies of depression and cardiac morbidity and mortality. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Orr2002,
abstract = {In general, the results of psychophysiologic research on PTSD support the presence of a variety of autonomic, sensory, and cognitive processing differences between individuals with and without the disorder. The findings are diverse and include heightened responsiveness to trauma reminders; exaggerated startle; increased conditionability and autonomic responsiveness to aversive, high-intensity stimuli; and elevated tonic or baseline physiologic activity. Increased sensitivity of the central nervous system is suggested by electrophysiologic evidence for a failure to habituate to redundant information, over-responsiveness to novel information, and reduced cortical responsiveness to overstimulation. Cognitive processing abnormalities are suggested by electrophysiologic evidence for a reduced ability to attend to task-relevant information and increased attention to task-irrelevant, trauma-related information in individuals with PTSD. Some findings, such as the heightened physiologic and P300 response amplitude responses to trauma-related stimuli and increased HR response to loud tones, have been highly replicable and appear to be as reliable as any biologic finding in the psychiatric literature. Other findings, such as increased eye-blink startle responses and tonic or baseline physiologic activity, have been less consistently replicated and have led investigators to explore how stressful or threatening experimental contexts might produce phasic alterations in the psychophysiology of individuals with PTSD. We hope that the broad range of psychophysiologic investigations and findings in PTSD will inspire others to consider possible applications of these methodologies to their own clinical and research endeavors. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

@article{Huikuri2013,
abstract = {Heart rate (HR) variability has been extensively studied in cardiac patients, especially in patients surviving an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and also in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. The majority of studies have shown that patients with reduced or abnormal HR variability have an increased risk of mortality within a few years after an AMI or after a diagnosis of CHF/LV dysfunction. Various measures of HR dynamics, such as time-domain, spectral, and non-linear measures of HR variability have been used in risk stratification. The prognostic power of various measures, except of those reflecting rapid R-R interval oscillations, has been almost identical, albeit some non-linear HR variability measures, such as short-term fractal scaling exponent have provided somewhat better prognostic information than the others. Abnormal HR variability predicts both sudden and non-sudden cardiac death. Because of remodeling of the arrhythmia substrate after AMI, early measurement of HR variability to identify those at high risk should likely be repeated later in order to assess the risk of fatal arrhythmia events. Future randomized trials using HR variability/turbulence as one of the pre-defined inclusion criteria will show whether routine measurement of HR variability/turbulence will become a routine clinical tool for risk stratification of cardiac patients. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors) reduce plasma cholesterol and improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation, inflammation and oxidative stress. A 'pleiotropic' property of statins receiving less attention is their effect on the autonomic nervous system. Increased central sympathetic outflow and diminished cardiac vagal tone are disturbances characteristic of a range of cardiovascular conditions for which statins are now prescribed routinely to reduce cardiovascular events: following myocardial infarction, and in hypertension, chronic kidney disease, heart failure and diabetes. The purpose of the present review is to synthesize contemporary evidence that statins can improve autonomic circulatory regulation. In experimental preparations, high-dose lipophilic statins have been shown to reduce adrenergic outflow by attenuating oxidative stress in central brain regions involved in sympathetic and parasympathetic discharge induction and modulation. In patients with hypertension, chronic kidney disease and heart failure, lipophilic statins, such as simvastatin or atorvastatin, have been shown to reduce MNSA (muscle sympathetic nerve activity) by 12–30 {\%}. Reports concerning the effect of statin therapy on HRV (heart rate variability) are less consistent. Because of their implications for BP (blood pressure) control, insulin sensitivity, arrhythmogenesis and sudden cardiac death, these autonomic nervous system actions should be considered additional mechanisms by which statins lower cardiovascular risk.},

Higher mean heart rate and an elevated percentage of heart rate above baseline were associated with physical health symptoms.

@article{Lampert2008a,
abstract = {Background: Many traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) are associated with altered autonomic function. Inflammation may provide a link between risk factors, autonomic dysfunction, and CAD. We examined the association between heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function, and inflammation, measured by C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Methods: We examined 264 middle-aged male twins free of symptomatic CAD. All underwent ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring and 24-hour ultra low, very low, low, and high-frequency power were calculated using power spectral analysis. C-reactive protein and IL-6 were measured, and risk factors including age, smoking, hypertension, lipids, diabetes, body mass index (BMI), depression, and physical activity were assessed. Results: Physical activity, BMI, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, depression, and hypertension were directly associated with CRP and IL-6 and inversely associated with one or more HRV variables. There was a graded inverse relationship between all HRV parameters (except high frequency) and CRP and IL-6. After adjustment for age, BMI, activity, high-density lipoprotein, smoking, hypertension, depression, and diabetes, ultra low frequency and very low frequency remained significant predictors of CRP (P {\textless} .01). Conclusions: C-reactive protein is associated with decreased HRV, even after controlling for traditional CAD risk factors. Autonomic dysregulation leading to inflammation may represent one pathway through which traditional risk factors promote development of CAD. {\textcopyright} 2008 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Baumert2008,
abstract = {Changes in measures of heart rate variability (HRV) have been associated with an increased risk for sudden cardiac death. The mechanisms underlying this association are not known. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between the amount of norepinephrine (NE) released from the cardiac sympathetic terminals and short-term HRV. The study comprised 8 healthy subjects, 12 patients with major depression, and 7 patients with panic disorder. Cardiac NE spillover was determined using direct coronary sinus blood sampling coupled with an NE isotope dilution methodology. Short-term HRV was quantified using detrended fluctuation analysis, symbolic dynamics, sample entropy, and standard time and frequency domain measures. Neither HRV nor cardiac NE spillover was significantly different between the analyzed groups. None of the standard HRV metrics was significantly correlated with cardiac NE spillover, but there was a moderate correlation between two complexity measures of HRV (symbolic dynamics) and cardiac NE spillover (patterns with 2 like variations, r = -0.37 and P = 0.05; and patterns with no variations: r = 0.34 and P = 0.06). In conclusion, there is no correlation between standard HRV measures and cardiac NE spillover in humans. Short-term complexity of heart rate is only moderately affected by sympathetic neural outflow. Therefore, the predictive value of most HRV measures for sudden cardiac death may predominantly result from their capacity to capture vagally mediated heart rate modulations.},

@techreport{Horsten1999,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to investigate associations between psychosocial risk factors, including social isolation, anger and depressive symptoms, and heart rate variability in healthy women. METHODS: The study group consisted of 300 healthy women (median age 57.5 years) who were representative of women living in the greater Stockholm area. For the measurement of social isolation, a condensed version of the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List was used and household size assessed. Anger was measured by the anger scales previously used in the Framingham study and depressive symptoms by a questionnaire derived from Pearlin. Health behaviors were measured by means of standard questionnaires. From 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, both time and frequency domain measures were obtained: SDNN index (mean of the SDs of all normal to normal intervals for all 5-minute segments of the entire recording), VLF power (very low frequency power), LF power (low frequency power), HF power (high frequency power), and the LF/HF ratio (low frequency by high frequency ratio) were computed. RESULTS: Social isolation and inability to relieve anger by talking to others were associated with decreased heart rate variability. Depressive symptoms were related only to the LF/HF ratio. Adjusting for age, menopausal status, exercise and smoking habits, history of hypertension, and BMI did not substantially change the results. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest heart rate variability to be a mediating mechanism that could explain at least part of the reported associations between social isolation, suppressed anger, and health outcomes.},
