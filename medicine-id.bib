abstract = {Several controlled clinical studies have evaluated the potential of the infection biomarker procalcitonin (PCT) to improve the diagnostic work-up of patients with bacterial infections and its influence on decisions regarding antibiotic therapy. Most research has focused on lower respiratory tract infections and critically ill sepsis patients. A clinical utility for PCT has also been found for patients with urinary tract infections, postoperative infections, meningitis, and patients with acute heart failure with possible superinfection (i.e., pneumonia). In these indications, PCT levels measured on hospital admission were found to substantially reduce the initiation of antibiotic treatment in low-risk situations (i.e., bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation). For more severe infections (i.e., pneumonia, sepsis), antibiotic stewardship by monitoring of PCT kinetics resulted in shorter antibiotic treatment durations with early cessation of therapy. Importantly, these strategies appear to be safe without increasing the risk for mortality, recurrent infections, or treatment failures. PCT kinetics also proved to have prognostic value correlating with disease severity (i.e., pancreatitis, abdominal infection) and resolution of illness (i.e., sepsis). Although promising findings have been published in these different types of infections, there are a number of limitations regarding PCT, including suboptimal sensitivity and/or specificity, which makes a careful interpretation of PCT in the clinical context mandatory. This narrative review aims to update clinicians on the strengths and limitations of PCT for patient management, focusing on research conducted within the last 4 years.},

abstract = {Understanding of the taxonomy and phylogeny of Cryptococcus gattii has been advanced by modern molecular techniques. C. gattii probably diverged from Cryptococcus neoformans between 16 million and 160 million years ago, depending on the dating methods applied, and maintains diversity by recombining in nature. South America is the likely source of the virulent C. gattii VGII molecular types that have emerged in North America. C. gattii shares major virulence determinants with C. neoformans, although genomic and transcriptomic studies revealed that despite similar genomes, the VGIIa and VGIIb subtypes employ very different transcriptional circuits and manifest differences in virulence phenotypes. Preliminary evidence suggests that C. gattii VGII causes severe lung disease and death without dissemination, whereas C. neoformans disseminates readily to the central nervous system (CNS) and causes death from meningoencephalitis. Overall, currently available data indicate that the C. gattii VGI, VGII, and VGIII molecular types more commonly affect nonimmunocompromised hosts, in contrast to VGIV. New, rapid, cheap diagnostic tests and imaging modalities are assisting early diagnosis and enabling better outcomes of cerebral cryptococcosis. Complications of CNS infection include increased intracranial pressure, severe neurological sequelae, and development of immune reconstitution syndrome, although the mortality rate is low. C. gattii VGII isolates may exhibit higher fluconazole MICs than other genotypes. Optimal therapeutic regimens are yet to be determined; in most cases, initial therapy with amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine is recommended.},

abstract = {Summary Since first identified in early 1977, bacteria of the genus Legionella are recognised as a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia and a rare cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia. Legionella bacteria multisystem manifestations mainly affect susceptible patients as a result of age, underlying debilitating conditions, or immunosuppression. Water is the major natural reservoir for Legionella, and the pathogen is found in many different natural and artificial aquatic environments such as cooling towers or water systems in buildings, including hospitals. The term given to the severe pneumonia and systemic infection caused by Legionella bacteria is Legionnaires' disease. Over time, the prevalence of legionellosis or Legionnaires' disease has risen, which might indicate a greater awareness and reporting of the disease. Advances in microbiology have led to a better understanding of the ecological niches and pathogenesis of the condition. Legionnaires' disease is not always suspected because of its non-specific symptoms, and the diagnostic tests routinely available do not offer the desired sensitivity. However, effective antibiotics are available. Disease notification systems provide the basis for initiating investigations and limiting the scale and recurrence of outbreaks. This report reviews our current understanding of this disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) is the cause of Kaposi sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and a form of Castleman disease (KSHV-MCD). Recently a KSHV-associated inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS) distinct from KSHV-MCD was reported. METHODS: We prospectively characterized the clinical, laboratory, virologic and immunologic features of KICS by evaluating symptomatic adults with KSHV using a prespecified definition. These features and overall survival were compared with controls from 2 prospectively characterized human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected cohorts, including 1 with KSHV coinfection. RESULTS: All 10 KICS subjects were HIV infected males; 5 had HIV viral load (VL) suppressed <50 copies mL (median 72, range <50-74 375); all had KS and 2 also had PEL. All had multiple severe symptoms attributable to KICS: median number of symptoms 8 (6-11), median grade of worst symptom 3 (2-4). These included gastrointestinal disturbance (present in 9); edema (9); respiratory (6); and effusions (5). Laboratory abnormalities included anemia (all); hypoalbuminemia (all) and thrombocytopenia (6). None developed KSHV-MCD; 6 died with median survival from KICS diagnosis 13.6 months. KICS subjects compared with controls had more severe symptoms; lower hemoglobin and albumin; higher C-reactive protein; higher KSHV VL; elevated interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10; and an increased risk of death (all P < .05). Anemia and hypoalbuminemia at presentation were independently associated with early death. CONCLUSIONS: KICS subjects demonstrated diverse severe symptoms, a high rate of KSHV-associated tumors, high mortality, and a distinct IL-6/IL-10 signature. KICS may be an important unrecognized cause of morbidity and mortality, including symptoms previously ascribed to HIV. Exploration of KSHV-directed therapy is warranted.},

abstract = {Cryptococcosis, a systemic fungal infection, has become a significant, global public health problem. Patients with liver disease have an increased predisposition to infections, such as Cryptococcosis. To report the underlying disease, the variety of etiologic agents involved and the outcomes of the Cryptococcosis in patients living with HBV and/or HCV, we reviewed 34 medical records of patients who were diagnosed with Cryptococcosis by the Mycology Laboratory of Santa Casa Hospital, Porto Alegre, Brazil. Males corresponded to 79 % of the patients, and the average patient age was 46.9 years. The cultures of 26/34 patients were positive: 25 patients were infected with Cryptococcus neoformans and one with C. gattii. A total of 14 deaths (41 %) occurred. As a criterion of our study, all patients had viral hepatitis infection: 27 (80 %) were infected with HCV, five (15 %) were infected with HBV, and two patients were infected with both viruses. Because HBV and/or HCV are transmitted among drug users through infected blood, and the end-stage cirrhotic liver must be transplanted, these two population types were well represented in this study and were analyzed in detail. Cryptococcosis patients living with HCV and/or HBV appear to have the same symptoms, mean age and gender distribution as the general Cryptococcosis population. Once Cryptococcosis affects the brain, a high mortality rate ensues; therefore, physicians must be aware of the possible occurrence of this disease in patients living with HCV and HBV.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the outcome of patients with sepsis according to location on a ward or in an intensive care unit. DESIGN: Prospective multicentered observational study. SETTING: Three academic hospitals in Madrid, Spain. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients with sepsis admitted to participating hospitals from March 1 to June 30, 2003. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During the study period, 15,852 patients >18 yrs of age were admitted. Sepsis was identified in 702 patients, giving an estimated cumulative incidence rate of 367 cases per 100,000 adult area residents per year and a cumulative incidence rate among patients admitted to the hospital of 4.4%. Most septic patients had a community-acquired infection (71%). Severe sepsis developed in 199 patients (incidence rate, 104 cases per 100,000 adult area residents per year), and 59 patients developed septic shock (incidence rate, 31 cases per 100,000 adult area residents per year). Most of the patients met the criteria for severe sepsis or septic shock on the same day that they would have qualified for the septic status one step down the scale. In the other patients, the median time between sepsis and severe sepsis was 2 days (interquartile range, 2-5) and between severe sepsis and septic shock was 3 days (interquartile range, 1-4). Only 32% of severe sepsis patients received intensive care. The hospital mortality for all septic patients was 12.8%; for severe sepsis, 20.7%; and for septic shock, 45.7%. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the high incidence of sepsis in a general population of patients admitted to hospital. A significant proportion of patients with severe sepsis are not transferred to the intensive care unit.},

abstract = {The single-dose absorption kinetics of ciprofloxa-tin in different regions of the human gastrointes-tinal tract were investigated using a remote-control drug delivery device (HF-capsule). Doses of 180 to 200 mg ciprofloxacin (as a lactic acid solution) were placed in the HF-capsule and ad-ministered to four healthy male adults. The posi-tion of the HF-capsule in the gastrointestinal tract was checked via radiographic examination. The release of the solution from the HF-capsule was induced by a radio signal. In each volunteer, the solution was released into five different re-gions of the gastrointestinal tract: the stomach (B), jejunum (C,), ileum (Cz), ascending colon (D1), and descending colon (D,). Two control runs (Al, A,), involving oral administration of the solution, were used as a reference for calcu-lation of area under the curve. The oral adminis-tration of a conventional 250-mg tablet (A,) was also studied. The plasma concentration of cipro-floxacin and urine concentrations of ciprofloxa-tin, desethylene-(Ml), sulfo-(M2), and oxo-ciprofloxacin (M3) were determined fluorimetri-tally by high-performance liquid chromatogra-phy. Intraindividual comparisons indicated a pro-gressive decrease in the amount of ciprofloxacin absorbed (100 percent = mean of AUCA1 and AUCAJ from the jejunum (-61 percent, median), ileum (-75 percent), colon ascendens (-90 per-cent), and colon descendens (-95 percent). Abso-lute amounts of renally excreted ciprofloxacin and metabolites decreased due to the reduced absorption of ciprofloxacin, but the metabolite pattern was unchanged. It is concluded that the main absorption site for ciprofloxacin is the upper part of the intestinal tract (duodenum, je-junum).},

First, increasing numbers of travelers are older than 60 years of age or are seeking health care elsewhere (" medical tour-ists "), and these travelers are more likely than others to have clinically significant coexisting conditions and consequently increased morbidity from infections. Sec-ond, the likelihood of multidrug resistance in the infecting organisms is increas-ing. 5-7 The recent Ebola epidemic in West Africa, the emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the reemergence of Zika and chikungunya viruses have highlighted the importance of being alert to the possi-bility that an emerging pathogen is causing a febrile episode.

The epidemiology of infective endocarditis has become more complex with today's myriad healthcare-associated factors that predispose to infection. Moreover, changes in pathogen prevalence, in particular a more common staphylococcal origin, have affected outcomes, which have not improved despite medical and surgical advances. METHODS AND RESULTS This statement updates the 2005 iteration, both of which were developed by the American Heart Association under the auspices of the Committee on Rheumatic Fever, Endocarditis, and Kawasaki Disease, Council on Cardiovascular Disease of the Young. It includes an evidenced-based system for diagnostic and treatment recommendations used by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association for treatment recommendations. CONCLUSIONS Infective endocarditis is a complex disease, and patients with this disease generally require management by a team of physicians and allied health providers with a variety of areas of expertise. The recommendations provided in this document are intended to assist in the management of this uncommon but potentially deadly infection. The clinical variability and complexity in infective endocarditis, however, dictate that these recommendations be used to support and not supplant decisions in individual patient management.},
