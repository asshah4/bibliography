abstract = {Aim Metformin is the most widely used oral hypoglycaemic drug, but it may lower B12status, which could have important clinical implications. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relationship between metformin use and vitamin B12deficiency in persons with type 2 diabetes. Methods Electronic database searches were undertaken (1st January 1957–1st July 2013) using the Cochrane library, Scopus, CINAHL, Grey literature databases, Pub Med Central, NICE Clinical Guidelines UK, and ongoing clinical trials. Included studies were of any study design, with data from patients with type 2 diabetes of any age or gender, taking any dose or duration of metformin. Planned primary outcomes were serum vitamin B12levels, {\%} prevalence or incidence of vitamin B12deficiency and risk of vitamin B12deficiency. Results Twenty-six papers were included in the review. Ten out of 17 observational studies showed statistically significantly lower levels of vitamin B12in patients on metformin than not on metformin. Meta-analysis performed on four trials demonstrated a statistically significant overall mean B12reducing effect of metformin of 57 pmol/L [WMD (fixed) = –0.57 (95{\%} CI: –35 to –79 pmol/L)] after 6 weeks to 3 months of use. Conclusion The evidence from this review demonstrates an association between metformin usage and lower levels of vitamin B12by 57 pmol/L, which leads to frank deficiency or borderline status in some patients with type 2 diabetes. This suggests that it is prudent to monitor B12levels in these patients who are at increased risk of deficiency.},

abstract = {Vitamin B12 (cobalamin, Cbl, B12) is an indispensable water-soluble micronutrient that serves as a coenzyme for cytosolic methionine synthase (MS) and mitochondrial methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM). Deficiency of Cbl, whether nutritional or due to inborn errors of Cbl metabolism, inactivate MS and MCM leading to the accumulation of homocysteine (Hcy) and methylmalonic acid (MMA), respectively. In conjunction with total B12 and its bioactive protein-bound form, holo-transcobalamin (holo-TC), Hcy, and MMA are the preferred serum biomarkers utilized to determine B12 status. Clinically, vitamin B12 deficiency leads to neurological deterioration and megaloblastic anemia, and, if left untreated, to death. Subclinical vitamin B12 deficiency (usually defined as a total serum B12 of {\textless}200 pmol/L) presents asymptomatically or with rather subtle generic symptoms that oftentimes are mistakenly ascribed to unrelated disorders. Numerous studies have now established that serum vitamin B12 has limited diagnostic value as a stand-alone marker. Low serum levels of vitamin B12 not always represent deficiency, and likewise, severe functional deficiency of the micronutrient has been documented in the presence of normal and even high levels of serum vitamin B12. This review discusses the usefulness and limitations of current biomarkers of B12 status in newborn screening, infant and adult diagnostics, the algorithms utilized to diagnose B12 deficiency and unusual findings of vitamin B12 status in various human disorders},

abstract = {Pheochromocytomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors with a highly variable clinical presentation, but they most commonly present as spells of headaches, sweating, palpitations, and hypertension. Patients with pheochromocytoma may develop complicated and potentially lethal cardiovascular and other complications, especially in the setting of diagnostic or interventional procedures (e.g. upon induction of anesthesia or during surgery). The serious and potentially lethal nature of such complications is due to the potent effect of paroxysmal release of catecholamines. Because this warrants prompt diagnosis and treatment, the physician should be aware of the clinical manifestations and complications of catecholamine excess and be able to provide proper preoperative management to minimize catecholamine-related pre-, intra-, and postoperative adverse events. The following clinical scenario and discussion aim to enhance the knowledge of the physician regarding the behavior of pheochromocytoma and to outline current approaches to comprehensive preoperative management of patients suffering from this tumor.},

abstract = {Aims There is increasing interest in using fructosamine measurements in screening for or managing diabetes, yet uncertainty remains as to whether these measurements should be corrected for variation in serum protein concentrations. Methods We considered all sets of simultaneous measurements of fructosamine, albumin, total serum protein (TP), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1C recorded in our laboratory over 10 years. The relationships between fructosamine and other variables were studied by multivariate linear regression and other analyses, and receiver operating curves (ROCs) were analysed to compare the diabetes screening performance of uncorrected fructosamine to those of albumin-corrected fructosamine (FAAlb) and TP-corrected fructosamine (FATP). Results 40,938 sets of measurements were collected from 20,114 patients. Though correlation between fructosamine and serum proteins was strongest among patients with HbA1C {\textless} 6.5{\%} (48 mmol/mol), it was also significant in the whole sample (r = 0.193 for albumin, r = 0.213 for TP). With diabetes defined by HbA1C ≥ 6.5{\%} (48 mmol/mol), the areas under the ROCs of FAAlb (0.905) and FATP (0.895) were both significantly greater (P {\textless} 0.001) than that of uncorrected fructosamine (0.878). Correction of fructosamine for albumin or TP slightly improved its correlation with HbA1C. There was no correlation of protein (albumin or TP) with log(fructosamine/protein). Conclusions Fructosamine concentration correlates significantly with albumin and total protein concentrations throughout their ranges. Correction of fructosamine improves its correlation with HbA1C and its performance in detecting diabetes.},
