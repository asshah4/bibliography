abstract = {The spectrum of frequencies producing the QRS complex has not been fully explored. In this manuscript we review previous studies of QRS frequency content, and discuss our novel method of the conjoint analysis of the ECG signal in six dimensions: in the domain of three space dimensions, in time domain, and in frequency domain. Orbital frequency of QRS loop is introduced as a six-dimensional characteristic of ventricular conduction, which helped to reveal inapparent ventricular conduction, and to characterize electrophysiological substrate. In this paper, we review our novel method in the historical context.},

abstract = {The ventricular gradient, an electrocardiographic concept calculated by integrating the area under the QRS complex and T-wave, represents the degree and direction of myocardial electrical heterogeneity. Although the concept of the ventricular gradient was first introduced in the 1930s, it has not yet found a place in routine electrocardiography. In the modern era, it is relatively simple to calculate the ventricular gradient in three dimensions (the spatial ventricular gradient (SVG)), and there is now renewed interest in using the SVG as a tool for risk stratification of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. This manuscript will review the history of the ventricular gradient, describe its electrophysiological meaning and significance, and discuss its clinical utility.},

abstract = {Objective: We proposed and tested a novel electrocardiogram marker of risk of ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). Methods: Digital orthogonal electrocardiograms were recorded at rest before implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation in 508 participants of a primary prevention ICDs prospective cohort study (mean ± SD age, 60 ± 12 years; 377 male [74{\%}]). The sum magnitude of the absolute QRST integral in 3 orthogonal leads (SAI QRST) was calculated. A derivation cohort of 128 patients was used to define a cutoff; a validation cohort (n = 380) was used to test a predictive value. Results: During a mean follow-up of 18 months, 58 patients received appropriate ICD therapies. The SAI QRST was lower in patients with VA (105.2 ± 60.1 vs 138.4 ± 85.7 mV - ms, P = .002). In the Cox proportional hazards analysis, patients with SAI QRST not exceeding 145 mV - ms had about 4-fold higher risk of VA (hazard ratio, 3.6; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.96-6.71; P {\textless} .0001) and a 6-fold higher risk of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (hazard ratio, 6.58; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.46-29.69; P = .014), whereas prediction of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: High SAI QRST is associated with low risk of sustained VA in patients with structural heart disease. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Methods: Atherosclerosis Risk In Community study participants with analyzable digital ECGs were included (n = 15,768; 55{\%} female, 73{\%} white, mean age 54.2 ± 5.8 y). We developed an algorithm to automatically detect the heart vector origin point on a median beat.

Global electrical heterogeneity was measured by sum absolute QRST integral (SAI QRST), spatial QRS-T angle, and spatial ventricular gradient (SVG) magnitude, azimuth, and elevation. Adjudicated SCD served as the primary outcome. Results: There was high intra-observer (kappa 0.972) and inter-observer (kappa 0.984) agreement in a heart vector origin definition between an automated algorithm and a human. QRS was wider in a median beat that was constructed using R-peak alignment than in time-coherent beat (88.1 ± 16.7 vs. 83.7 ± 15.9 ms; P {\textless} 0.0001), and on a median beat constructed using QRS-onset as a zeroed baseline, vs. isoelectric origin point (86.7 ± 15.9 vs. 83.7 ± 15.9 ms; P {\textless} 0.0001). ROC AUC was significantly larger for QRS, QT, peak QRS-T angle, SVG elevation, and SAI QRST if measured on a time-coherent median beat, and for SAI QRST and SVG magnitude if measured on a median beat using isoelectric origin point. Conclusion: Time-coherent global XYZ median beat with physiologically meaningful definition of the heart vector's origin point improved predictive accuracy of SCD biomarkers.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Electrocardiography (ECG) may detect subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) in asymptomatic individuals, but its role in assessing adverse events beyond traditional risk factors is not clear. Interval and vector data that are commonly available on modern ECGs may offer independent prognostic information that improves risk classification. OBJECTIVES: To derive and validate a CVD risk equation based on ECG metrics and to determine its incremental benefit in addition to the Framingham risk score (FRS). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study included 3640 randomly selected community-based adults aged 40 to 74 years without known CVD from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) cohort (1971-1975) and 6329 from the NHANES III cohort (1988-1994). Participants were sampled from across the United States. A risk score to assess incident nonfatal and fatal CVD events was derived based on computer-generated ECG data, including frontal P, R, and T axes; heart rate; and PR, QRS, and QT intervals from NHANES I. The most prognostic variables, along with age and sex, were incorporated into the NHANES ECG risk equation. The equation was evaluated in the NHANES III cohort for an independent validation. Follow-up in the NHANES III cohort was completed on December 31, 2006. Data for this study were analyzed from August 11, 2015, to May 20, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was CVD death. Secondary outcomes included 10-year ischemic heart disease and all-cause death. RESULTS: The final study sample included 9969 participants (4714 men [47.3{\%}]; 5255 women [52.7{\%}]; mean [SD] age, 55.3 [10.1] years) from both cohorts. Frontal T axis, heart rate, and heart rate–corrected QT interval were the most significant ECG factors in the NHANES I cohort. In the validation cohort (NHANES III), the equation provided for prognostic information for fatal CVD with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.23 (95{\%} CI, 2.82-3.72); the C statistic was 0.79 (95{\%} CI, 0.76-0.81). When added to the FRS in Cox proportional hazards regression models, the categorical (1{\%}, 5{\%}, and 10{\%} cutoffs) net reclassification improvement was 24{\%}. When the FRS and ECG scores were combined in a single model, the C statistic improved by 0.04 (95{\%} CI, 0.02-0.06) to 0.80 (95{\%} CI, 0.77-0.82). Similar improvements were noted when the ECG score was added to the pooled cohort equation. When the equation for prognostic information about ischemic heart disease and all-cause death was evaluated, the results were similar. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: An ECG risk score based on age, sex, heart rate, frontal T axis, and QT interval assesses the risk for CVD and compares favorably with the FRS alone in an independent cohort of asymptomatic individuals. Although the ECG risk equation is low cost, further research is needed to ascertain whether this additional step in risk stratification may improve prevention efforts and reduce CVD events.},

@article{Hurst2005a,
abstract = {The concept of the ventricular gradient was conceived in the mind of Frank Wilson in the early 1930s. Wilson, a mathematical genius, believed that the calculation of the ventricular gradient yielded information that was not otherwise obtainable. The method of analysis was not utilized by clinicians at large because the concept was not easy to understand and because the method used to compute the direction of the ventricular gradient was so time consuming that clinicians could not use it. Grant utilized the concept to create vector electrocardiography, but he believed that if his method of analysis was used, it was not often necessary to compute the direction of the ventricular gradient. He did, however, describe an easy way to compute the direction of the ventricular gradient. The current major clinical use of the ventricular gradient is to identify primary and secondary T-wave abnormalities in an electrocardiogram showing left or right ventricular hypertrophy or left or right ventricular conduction abnormalities. In addition, the author uses the term ventricular time gradient instead of ventricular gradient in an effort to clarify the concept. Finally, the author discusses the possible clinical significance of a normally directed, but shorter than normal, ventricular time gradient, an attribute that has not been emphasized previously.},

abstract = {This review summarizes recent findings and discusses a clinical significance of a vectorcardiographic (VCG) Global electrical heterogeneity (GEH). GEH concept is based on the concept of the spatial ventricular gradient (SVG), which is a global measure of the dispersion of total recovery time. We quantify GEH by measuring five features of the SVG vector (SVG magnitude, direction (azimuth and elevation), a scalar value, and spatial QRS-T angle) on orthogonal XYZ ECG. In analysis of more than 20,000 adults we showed that GEH is independently associated with sudden cardiac death (SCD) after adjustment for demographics, cardiovascular disease (time-updated incident non-fatal cardiovascular events [coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, atrial fibrillation, use of beta-blockers], and known risk factors [cholesterol, triglycerides, physical activity index, smoking, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, antihypertensive medications, creatinine, alcohol intake, left ventricular ejection fraction, and time-updated ECG metrics (heart rate, QTc, QRS duration, ECG-left ventricular hypertrophy, bundle branch block or interventricular conduction delay)]. This finding suggests that GEH represents an independent electrophysiological substrate of SCD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sex and age have long been known to affect the ECG. Several biologic variables and anatomic factors may contribute to sex and age-related differences on the ECG. We hypothesized that a convolutional neural network (CNN) could be trained through a process called deep learning to predict a person's age and self-reported sex using only 12-lead ECG signals. We further hypothesized that discrepancies between CNN-predicted age and chronological age may serve as a physiological measure of health. METHODS: We trained CNNs using 10-second samples of 12-lead ECG signals from 499 727 patients to predict sex and age. The networks were tested on a separate cohort of 275 056 patients. Subsequently, 100 randomly selected patients with multiple ECGs over the course of decades were identified to assess within-individual accuracy of CNN age estimation. RESULTS: Of 275 056 patients tested, 52{\%} were males and mean age was 58.6±16.2 years. For sex classification, the model obtained 90.4{\%} classification accuracy with an area under the curve of 0.97 in the independent test data. Age was estimated as a continuous variable with an average error of 6.9±5.6 years (R-squared =0.7). Among 100 patients with multiple ECGs over the course of at least 2 decades of life, most patients (51{\%}) had an average error between real age and CNN-predicted age of {\textless}7 years. Major factors seen among patients with a CNN-predicted age that exceeded chronologic age by {\textgreater}7 years included: low ejection fraction, hypertension, and coronary disease (P{\textless}0.01). In the 27{\%} of patients where correlation was {\textgreater}0.8 between CNN-predicted and chronologic age, no incident events occurred over follow-up (33±12 years). CONCLUSIONS: Applying artificial intelligence to the ECG allows prediction of patient sex and estimation of age. The ability of an artificial intelligence algorithm to determine physiological age, with further validation, may serve as a measure of overall health.},

abstract = {Introduction: Cardiac involvement is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in primary light chain (AL) amyloidosis. The electrocardiographic spatial QRS-T angle reflects changes in the direction of the repolarization sequence and is a powerful predictor of outcome in patients with heart failure. We examined the significance of the frontal QRS-T angle in predicting the clinical outcome in patients with AL cardiac amyloidosis. Methods: Forty-three consecutive patients with cardiac involvement of AL amyloidosis were studied. Patients were followed for survival. Results: Patient median age was 62 years, 56{\%} were males. After a median follow up of 56 months, 16 out of 43 patients had died (37{\%}). The median QRS-T angle was 102° (interquartile range 35–148). QRS-T angle{\textgreater}102° was associated with increased prevalence of lambda free light chain disease and the presence of a pleural effusion. It was also associated with increased interventricular septum thickness, smaller left ventricle end-diastolic diameter, echocardiographic myocardial sparkling texture, pericardial effusion, elevated NT-Pro-BNP and increased restrictive physiology evident by increased E/A and E/e`. A QRS-T angle{\textgreater}102° was a significant predictor of increased mortality by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (71.6 ± 11.1{\%} vs. 45.7 ± 11.1{\%}, P = .02). A QRS-T angle{\textgreater}102° was an independent predictor of mortality by Cox regression analysis (HR 3.00, 95{\%} CI 1.01–8.89, P {\textless} .05). Conclusions: The QRS-T angle is associated with indices of advanced amyloid disease and is an independent predictor of survival.},

abstract = {Background - Asymptomatic individuals account for the majority of sudden cardiac deaths (SCDs). Development of effective, low-cost, and noninvasive SCD risk stratification tools is necessary. Methods and Results - Participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study and Cardiovascular Health Study (n=20 177; age, 59.3±10.1 years; age range, 44-100 years; 56{\%} female; 77{\%} white) were followed up for 14.0 years (median). Five ECG markers of global electric heterogeneity (GEH; sum absolute QRST integral, spatial QRST angle, spatial ventricular gradient [SVG] magnitude, SVG elevation, and SVG azimuth) were measured on standard 12-lead ECGs. Cox proportional hazards and competing risks models evaluated associations between GEH electrocardiographic parameters and SCD. An SCD competing risks score was derived from demographics, comorbidities, and GEH parameters. SCD incidence was 1.86 per 1000 person-years. After multivariable adjustment, baseline GEH parameters and large increases in GEH parameters over time were independently associated with SCD. Final SCD risk scores included age, sex, race, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, and GEH parameters as continuous variables. When GEH parameters were added to clinical/demographic factors, the C statistic increased from 0.777 to 0.790 (P=0.008), the risk score classified 10-year SCD risk as high ({\textgreater}5{\%}) in 7.2{\%} of participants, 10{\%} of SCD victims were appropriately reclassified into a high-risk category, and only 1.4{\%} of SCD victims were inappropriately reclassified from high to intermediate risk. The net reclassification index was 18.3{\%}. Conclusions - Abnormal electrophysiological substrate quantified by GEH parameters is independently associated with SCD in the general population. The addition of GEH parameters to clinical characteristics improves SCD risk prediction.},

We segmented the ECG into standard component waveforms and intervals using a novel combination of convolutional neural networks and hidden Markov models and evaluated this segmentation by comparing resulting electrical intervals against 141 864 measurements produced during the clinical workflow. We then built a patient-level ECG profile, a 725-element feature vector and used this profile to train and interpret machine learning models for examples of cardiac structure (left ventricular mass, left atrial volume, and mitral annulus e-prime) and disease (pulmonary arterial hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloid, and mitral valve prolapse). ECG measurements derived from the convolutional neural network-hidden Markov model segmentation agreed with clinical estimates, with median absolute deviations as a fraction of observed value of 0.6{\%} for heart rate and 4{\%} for QT interval. Models trained using patient-level ECG profiles enabled surprising quantitative estimates of left ventricular mass and mitral annulus e' velocity (median absolute deviation of 16{\%} and 19{\%}, respectively) with good discrimination for left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction as binary traits. Model performance using our approach for disease detection demonstrated areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.94 for pulmonary arterial hypertension, 0.91 for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 0.86 for cardiac amyloid, and 0.77 for mitral valve prolapse. CONCLUSIONS: Modern machine learning methods can extend the 12-lead ECG to quantitative applications well beyond its current uses while preserving the transparency that is so fundamental to clinical care.},

abstract = {Background - Asymptomatic individuals account for the majority of sudden cardiac deaths (SCDs). Development of effective, low-cost, and noninvasive SCD risk stratification tools is necessary. Methods and Results - Participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study and Cardiovascular Health Study (n=20 177; age, 59.3±10.1 years; age range, 44-100 years; 56{\%} female; 77{\%} white) were followed up for 14.0 years (median). Five ECG markers of global electric heterogeneity (GEH; sum absolute QRST integral, spatial QRST angle, spatial ventricular gradient [SVG] magnitude, SVG elevation, and SVG azimuth) were measured on standard 12-lead ECGs. Cox proportional hazards and competing risks models evaluated associations between GEH electrocardiographic parameters and SCD. An SCD competing risks score was derived from demographics, comorbidities, and GEH parameters. SCD incidence was 1.86 per 1000 person-years. After multivariable adjustment, baseline GEH parameters and large increases in GEH parameters over time were independently associated with SCD. Final SCD risk scores included age, sex, race, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, and GEH parameters as continuous variables. When GEH parameters were added to clinical/demographic factors, the C statistic increased from 0.777 to 0.790 (P=0.008), the risk score classified 10-year SCD risk as high ({\textgreater}5{\%}) in 7.2{\%} of participants, 10{\%} of SCD victims were appropriately reclassified into a high-risk category, and only 1.4{\%} of SCD victims were inappropriately reclassified from high to intermediate risk. The net reclassification index was 18.3{\%}. Conclusions - Abnormal electrophysiological substrate quantified by GEH parameters is independently associated with SCD in the general population. The addition of GEH parameters to clinical characteristics improves SCD risk prediction.},

GEH concept is based on the concept of the spatial ventricular gradient (SVG), which is a global measure of the dispersion of total recovery time. We quantify GEH by measuring five features of the SVG vector (SVG magnitude, direction (azimuth and elevation), a scalar value, and spatial QRS-T angle) on orthogonal XYZ ECG. In analysis of more than 20,000 adults we showed that GEH is independently associated with sudden cardiac death (SCD) after adjustment for demographics, cardiovascular disease (time-updated incident non-fatal cardiovascular events [coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, atrial fibrillation, use of beta-blockers], and known risk factors [cholesterol, triglycerides, physical activity index, smoking, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, antihypertensive medications, creatinine, alcohol intake, left ventricular ejection fraction, and time-updated ECG metrics (heart rate, QTc, QRS duration, ECG-left ventricular hypertrophy, bundle branch block or interventricular conduction delay)]. This finding suggests that GEH represents an independent electrophysiological substrate of SCD.},

abstract = {Introduction: Cardiac involvement is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in primary light chain (AL) amyloidosis. The electrocardiographic spatial QRS-T angle reflects changes in the direction of the repolarization sequence and is a powerful predictor of outcome in patients with heart failure. We examined the significance of the frontal QRS-T angle in predicting the clinical outcome in patients with AL cardiac amyloidosis. Methods: Forty-three consecutive patients with cardiac involvement of AL amyloidosis were studied. Patients were followed for survival. Results: Patient median age was 62 years, 56{\%} were males. After a median follow up of 56 months, 16 out of 43 patients had died (37{\%}). The median QRS-T angle was 102° (interquartile range 35–148). QRS-T angle{\textgreater}102° was associated with increased prevalence of lambda free light chain disease and the presence of a pleural effusion. It was also associated with increased interventricular septum thickness, smaller left ventricle end-diastolic diameter, echocardiographic myocardial sparkling texture, pericardial effusion, elevated NT-Pro-BNP and increased restrictive physiology evident by increased E/A and E/e`. A QRS-T angle{\textgreater}102° was a significant predictor of increased mortality by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (71.6 ± 11.1{\%} vs. 45.7 ± 11.1{\%}, P = .02). A QRS-T angle{\textgreater}102° was an independent predictor of mortality by Cox regression analysis (HR 3.00, 95{\%} CI 1.01–8.89, P {\textless} .05). Conclusions: The QRS-T angle is associated with indices of advanced amyloid disease and is an independent predictor of survival.},

abstract = {The concept of the ventricular gradient was conceived in the mind of Frank Wilson in the early 1930s. Wilson, a mathematical genius, believed that the calculation of the ventricular gradient yielded information that was not otherwise obtainable. The method of analysis was not utilized by clinicians at large because the concept was not easy to understand and because the method used to compute the direction of the ventricular gradient was so time consuming that clinicians could not use it. Grant utilized the concept to create vector electrocardiography, but he believed that if his method of analysis was used, it was not often necessary to compute the direction of the ventricular gradient. He did, however, describe an easy way to compute the direction of the ventricular gradient. The current major clinical use of the ventricular gradient is to identify primary and secondary T-wave abnormalities in an electrocardiogram showing left or right ventricular hypertrophy or left or right ventricular conduction abnormalities. In addition, the author uses the term ventricular time gradient instead of ventricular gradient in an effort to clarify the concept. Finally, the author discusses the possible clinical significance of a normally directed, but shorter than normal, ventricular time gradient, an attribute that has not been emphasized previously.},

abstract = {Background: We developed a novel electrocardiographic marker, T-wave area dispersion (TW-Ad), which measures repolarization heterogeneity by assessing interlead T-wave areas during a single cardiac cycle and tested whether it can identify patients at risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the general population. Methods and Results: TW-Ad was measured from standard digital 12-lead ECG in 5618 adults (46{\%} men; age, 50.9±12.5 years) participating in the Health 2000 Study - an epidemiological survey representative of the Finnish adult population. Independent replication was performed in 3831 participants of the KORA S4 Study (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg; 49{\%} men; age, 48.7±13.7 years; mean follow-up, 8.8±1.1 years). During follow-up (7.7±1.4 years), 72 SCDs occurred in the Health 2000 Survey. Lower TW-Ad was univariately associated with SCD (0.32±0.36 versus 0.60±0.19; P{\textless}0.001); it had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.809. TW-Ad (≤0.46) conferred a hazard ratio of 10.8 (95{\%} confidence interval, 6.8-17.4; P{\textless}0.001) for SCD; it remained independently predictive of SCD after multivariable adjustment for clinical risk markers (hazard ratio, 4.6; 95{\%} confidence interval, 2.7-7.4; P{\textless}0.001).

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Electrocardiography (ECG) may detect subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) in asymptomatic individuals, but its role in assessing adverse events beyond traditional risk factors is not clear. Interval and vector data that are commonly available on modern ECGs may offer independent prognostic information that improves risk classification. OBJECTIVES: To derive and validate a CVD risk equation based on ECG metrics and to determine its incremental benefit in addition to the Framingham risk score (FRS). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study included 3640 randomly selected community-based adults aged 40 to 74 years without known CVD from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) cohort (1971-1975) and 6329 from the NHANES III cohort (1988-1994). Participants were sampled from across the United States. A risk score to assess incident nonfatal and fatal CVD events was derived based on computer-generated ECG data, including frontal P, R, and T axes; heart rate; and PR, QRS, and QT intervals from NHANES I. The most prognostic variables, along with age and sex, were incorporated into the NHANES ECG risk equation. The equation was evaluated in the NHANES III cohort for an independent validation. Follow-up in the NHANES III cohort was completed on December 31, 2006. Data for this study were analyzed from August 11, 2015, to May 20, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was CVD death. Secondary outcomes included 10-year ischemic heart disease and all-cause death. RESULTS: The final study sample included 9969 participants (4714 men [47.3{\%}]; 5255 women [52.7{\%}]; mean [SD] age, 55.3 [10.1] years) from both cohorts. Frontal T axis, heart rate, and heart rate–corrected QT interval were the most significant ECG factors in the NHANES I cohort. In the validation cohort (NHANES III), the equation provided for prognostic information for fatal CVD with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.23 (95{\%} CI, 2.82-3.72); the C statistic was 0.79 (95{\%} CI, 0.76-0.81). When added to the FRS in Cox proportional hazards regression models, the categorical (1{\%}, 5{\%}, and 10{\%} cutoffs) net reclassification improvement was 24{\%}. When the FRS and ECG scores were combined in a single model, the C statistic improved by 0.04 (95{\%} CI, 0.02-0.06) to 0.80 (95{\%} CI, 0.77-0.82). Similar improvements were noted when the ECG score was added to the pooled cohort equation. When the equation for prognostic information about ischemic heart disease and all-cause death was evaluated, the results were similar. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: An ECG risk score based on age, sex, heart rate, frontal T axis, and QT interval assesses the risk for CVD and compares favorably with the FRS alone in an independent cohort of asymptomatic individuals. Although the ECG risk equation is low cost, further research is needed to ascertain whether this additional step in risk stratification may improve prevention efforts and reduce CVD events.},

abstract = {Objective: We proposed and tested a novel electrocardiogram marker of risk of ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). Methods: Digital orthogonal electrocardiograms were recorded at rest before implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation in 508 participants of a primary prevention ICDs prospective cohort study (mean ± SD age, 60 ± 12 years; 377 male [74{\%}]). The sum magnitude of the absolute QRST integral in 3 orthogonal leads (SAI QRST) was calculated. A derivation cohort of 128 patients was used to define a cutoff; a validation cohort (n = 380) was used to test a predictive value. Results: During a mean follow-up of 18 months, 58 patients received appropriate ICD therapies. The SAI QRST was lower in patients with VA (105.2 ± 60.1 vs 138.4 ± 85.7 mV - ms, P = .002). In the Cox proportional hazards analysis, patients with SAI QRST not exceeding 145 mV - ms had about 4-fold higher risk of VA (hazard ratio, 3.6; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.96-6.71; P {\textless} .0001) and a 6-fold higher risk of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (hazard ratio, 6.58; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.46-29.69; P = .014), whereas prediction of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation did not reach statistical significance.
