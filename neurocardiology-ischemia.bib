abstract = {Objectives The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of evaluation for appropriate use of radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in multiple clinical sites and to determine use patterns as well as identify areas of apparent inappropriate use.Background Although cardiac imaging is highly valued for decision-making, the growth and expense related to these procedures has raised questions regarding overuse. The publication of appropriate use criteria (AUC), including those for MPI, were designed to provide guidance in the rational use of testing. However, limited data regarding the implementation and evaluation of AUC are available.Methods Six diverse clinical sites enrolled consecutive patients undergoing MPI, collecting point-of-service data entered into an online form. An automated algorithm assigned a specific indication from the AUC that was classified as appropriate, uncertain, or inappropriate. Site-specific feedback was later provided to each practice on ordering patterns.Results Of the 6,351 patients enrolled, 93% were successfully assigned an appropriateness level. Inappropriate use of MPI was found in 14.4% of patients, with a range of 4% to 22% among practices. Women and younger patients were more likely to undergo inappropriate MPI. Asymptomatic, low-risk patients accounted for 44.5% of inappropriate testing. Elimination of the 5 most common inappropriate use indications would reduce overall imaging volume by 13.2%. Inappropriate use by physicians from within the practice performing imaging was not greater than physicians outside of the practice. Educational feedback might have resulted in reduced inappropriate test ordering in 1 site.Conclusions The tracking of appropriate use is feasible in clinical practice, with an automated system that can readily identify practice patterns and targets for educational and quality improvement initiatives. This approach might provide an alternative to utilization management.},

abstract = {Coronary artery events requiring intervention are associated with depressed cardiac autonomic function. Whether a 6-week cardiac rehabilitation (CR) differs in effectiveness in improving exercise capacity (6MWT), cardiorespiratory function (peakVO2), and autonomic function (HRV) following either cardiac bypass surgery (CABG) or percutaneous coronary revascularization (PCI) is unknown. The current study therefore compared the change in 6MWT and peak VO2 to HRV variables following a 6-week CR program and with patients having either PCI or CABG. Thirty-eight patients, (PCI, n = 22 and CABG, n = 16) participated in the CR program and results for pre and post 6 min walk test (6MWT), peakVO2, and heart rate variability (HRV) were obtained. Our study has shown that a 6 weeks program following either PCI or CABG improves function. However, the effect on post-CABG differs to that of post-PCI patients. The change in distance walked (6MWT, metres) was higher in the CABG ($\Delta$6MWT: 61, p < 0.001) compared to the PCI group ($\Delta$6MWT: 41, p < 0.001). Maximum exercise capacity (peak VO2, ml/kg.min) also changed significantly with a greater change in the CABG group ($\Delta$PCI: 0.7, p < 0.001; $\Delta$CABG: 1.0, p < 0.001) but did not reach normal population values. Although an improvement in HRV parameters was noted for the PCI group, a statistically significant improvement in HRV was observed only in the CABG group for the following; SDNN (ms) (baseline vs. post-rehabilitation (median ± IQR): 31.2 ± 25.6 vs. 51.8 ± 23.1, p < 0.01), RMSSD (19.32 ± 19.9 vs. 42.1 ± 34.2, p < 0.01); LF (ms(2)) (191 ± 216 vs. 631 ± 693, p < 0.01) and HF (107 ± 201 vs. 449 ± 795.0, p < 0.05). A significant interaction in the PCI group but not in the CABG group was observed using correlation analysis between the 6MWT and peak VO2 with HRV parameters indicating that being healthier that is, a better 6MWT and peak VO2 led to better HRV results but no significant effect of CR in the PCI group. When the results were investigated for baseline 6MWT and peak VO2 effect using a covariate analysis, a significant influence of CR on HRV parameters was retained in the CABG group (p = 0.0072). Our study indicates that a 6-weeks CR program benefits both patient groups in terms of exercise capacity, cardiorespiratory function and autonomic nervous system modulation of heart rate, with CABG patients showing the most improvement. HRV can be a useful additional variable to gauge cardiac function following CR.},

abstract = {Background: Symptomatic relief is the primary goal of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in stable angina and is commonly observed clinically. However, there is no evidence from blinded, placebo-controlled randomised trials to show its efficacy. Methods: ORBITA is a blinded, multicentre randomised trial of PCI versus a placebo procedure for angina relief that was done at five study sites in the UK. We enrolled patients with severe (≥70%) single-vessel stenoses. After enrolment, patients received 6 weeks of medication optimisation. Patients then had pre-randomisation assessments with cardiopulmonary exercise testing, symptom questionnaires, and dobutamine stress echocardiography. Patients were randomised 1:1 to undergo PCI or a placebo procedure by use of an automated online randomisation tool. After 6 weeks of follow-up, the assessments done before randomisation were repeated at the final assessment. The primary endpoint was difference in exercise time increment between groups. All analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle and the study population contained all participants who underwent randomisation. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02062593. Findings: ORBITA enrolled 230 patients with ischaemic symptoms. After the medication optimisation phase and between Jan 6, 2014, and Aug 11, 2017, 200 patients underwent randomisation, with 105 patients assigned PCI and 95 assigned the placebo procedure. Lesions had mean area stenosis of 84{\textperiodcentered}4% (SD 10{\textperiodcentered}2), fractional flow reserve of 0{\textperiodcentered}69 (0{\textperiodcentered}16), and instantaneous wave-free ratio of 0{\textperiodcentered}76 (0{\textperiodcentered}22). There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint of exercise time increment between groups (PCI minus placebo 16{\textperiodcentered}6 s, 95% CI −8{\textperiodcentered}9 to 42{\textperiodcentered}0, p=0{\textperiodcentered}200). There were no deaths. Serious adverse events included four pressure-wire related complications in the placebo group, which required PCI, and five major bleeding events, including two in the PCI group and three in the placebo group. Interpretation: In patients with medically treated angina and severe coronary stenosis, PCI did not increase exercise time by more than the effect of a placebo procedure. The efficacy of invasive procedures can be assessed with a placebo control, as is standard for pharmacotherapy.

@article{Lampert2003a,
abstract = {This study evaluated the effects of propranolol on recovery of heart rate variability (HRV) after acute myocardial infarction and its relation to outcome in the Beta-blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT). Beta blockers improve mortality after acute myocardial infarction, but through an unknown mechanism. Depressed HRV, a measure of autonomic tone, predicts mortality after acute myocardial infarction. Whether $\beta$ blockers influence recovery of HRV after acute myocardial infarction, and thereby improve outcome, is unknown. We compared 24-hour HRV parameters at 1 week after acute myocardial infarction and after 6 weeks of treatment with propanolol (n = 88) or placebo (n = 96). The relation between 25-month outcome (death/acute myocardial infarction/congestive heart failure), propranolol treatment, and HRV was further analyzed. After 6 weeks, high-frequency (HF) power (log-normalized), an index of vagal tone, increased more in propranolol-treated patients (4.28 ± 0.1 to 5.17 ± 0.09 ms2) than in placebo-treated patients (4.26 ± 0.09 to 4.77 ± 0.1 ms2, p <0.05). Sympathovagal balance measured by the low-frequency (LF) to HF ratio increased in placebo-treated patients (3.55 ± 0.24 to 3.86 ± 0.24) but decreased in those treated with propranolol (3.76 ± 0.29 to 3.17 ± 0.23, p <0.01). Other frequency-domain parameters increased over time but were not affected by propranolol. Propranolol blunted the morning increase in the LF/HF ratio. Recovery of HF, the strongest HRV predictor of outcome, and propranolol therapy independently predicted outcome. In summary, after acute myocardial infarction, propranolol therapy improves recovery of parasympathetic tone, which correlates with improved outcome, and decreases morning sympathetic predominance. These findings may elucidate the mechanisms by which $\beta$ blockers decrease mortality and reduce the early morning risk of sudden death after acute myocardial infarction. {\textcopyright} 2003 by Excerpta Medica, Inc.},

@article{Brown1995,
abstract = {Prior studies have suggested that, compared with angiographic, exercise electrocardiographic, and clinical data in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD), the data provided by exercise thallium-201 scintigraphy are the best predictor of cardiac events. The most consistent finding is that the presence and extent of jeopardized viable myocardium, manifest by transient thallium-201 defects, predicts cardiac events. In addition, a normal thallium-201 scan reliably predicts an annual event rate for cardiac death or nonfatal myocardial infarction of < 1% per year, a rate approaching that of a normal aged-matched population. Further, it has been demonstrated that the incremental prognostic value of transient thallium-201 defects is statistically significant and nearly double that of clinical data and stress electrocardiography combined, and, importantly, not significantly different from that obtained by adding angiographic data. These results appear to hold for the newer, technetium-99m-based perfusion agents such as sestamibi, for which sensitivity and specificity for detecting CAD are comparable. Stress echocardiography, which depends on development of a secondary phenomenon (abnormal wall motion), appears to be less sensitive for the detection of CAD than myocardial perfusion imaging (which can detect the primary insult, hypoperfusion); stress echocardiography is also less sensitive for detection of jeopardized viable myocardium. Because of its lower sensitivity for detecting jeopardized viable myocardium, stress echocardiography may underestimate the risk of cardiac events, especially in patients with known CAD. Thus it may not reliably identify a low-risk group, especially in patients with known CAD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is evident in only half of patients referred for diagnostic angiography. Five-minute heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive marker for autonomic control of the vasculature, which this study hypothesised could risk-stratify cardiac patients and reduce unnecessary angiograms.\n\nDESIGN: A prospective observational study (the Alternative Risk Markers in Coronary Artery Disease (ARM-CAD) study).\n\nSETTING: Three cardiac centres in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nPATIENTS: 470 consecutive patients undergoing elective angiography (with predominantly normal cardiac rhythm), regardless of co-morbidity.\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The presence of obstructive CAD (≥50% stenosis) on angiography.\n\nRESULTS: Patients with obstructive CAD had significantly reduced HRV, particularly in the low frequency (LF) range (median 180 vs 267 ms(2) without CAD; p<0.001). There was a linear trend with the severity of CAD; median LF power (IQR) in patients with normal coronaries was 275 (612), with minor coronary irregularities 255 (400), single-vessel CAD 212 (396) and more severe disease 170 (327) ms(2); p value for trend 0.003. There was a similar reduction in LF power regardless of the anatomical location of coronary stenoses. Comparing patients with LF less than 250 and 250 ms(2) or greater, the adjusted OR for obstructive CAD using multivariate regression was 2.42, 95% CI 1.33 to 4.38 (p=0.004). No interactions were noted in subgroup analysis and HRV added to risk prediction irrespective of the baseline Framingham risk (p<0.0001).\n\nCONCLUSION: Low HRV is strongly predictive of angiographic coronary disease regardless of other co-morbidities and is clinically useful as a risk predictor in patients with sinus rhythm.\n\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION INFORMATION: http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00403351 www.armcad.com.},

abstract = {Background: Abnormal stress myocardial perfusion imaging studies (SMPI) with angiographically insignificant coronary artery disease (ICAD) have often been labeled "false positive" scans. We evaluated the prognostic predictors and outcomes in an unselected patient population having abnormal SMPI and ICAD (study group) over a 24 month period of follow-up. Methods: Retrospective study of consecutive patients who had SMPI and subsequent coronary angiography showing ICAD within 6 months of index scan with matched control group with normal scans. Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) were defined as the first occurrence of death or myocardial infarction (MI). Patients were followed up to 24 months from the time of their SMPI to identify the development of MACE. Results: One hundred and twenty five patients formed the study group and one hundred and thirty six patients formed the control group. Over a two-year follow up, approximately 13% of the study group had MACE as compared to 4.2% in the control group (P = .022). Abnormal SMPI, EF < 40% and chronic kidney disease (GFR < 60 ml/min) were independent predictors of MACE in the study group. In multivariate analysis for MACE prediction, chronic kidney disease remained the sole independent predictor regardless of size or severity of perfusion abnormalities (P = <.001). Conclusion: Patients with abnormal SMPI and ICAD have a 13% event rate of MACE over a two-year follow up. CKD seems a very important marker of a higher risk subgroup amongst such patients. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Society of Nuclear Cardiology.},

abstract = {Background: Limited data suggest that the AHA Heart Healthy score (Life's Simple 7TM; AHA score) is inversely associated with the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the biological mechanisms that underlie this association have not been elucidated. Methods & Results: We investigated the association between the AHA Score and concentrations of circulating biomarkers and prevalent subclinical CVD (defined using a validated index consisting of at least one of the following: increased carotid intima media thickness or stenosis; left ventricular hypertrophy (by ECG or echocardiography) or systolic dysfunction (by echocardiography); microalbuminuria; and a reduced ankle-brachial index) in up to 2680 Framingham Offspring Study participants (mean age 58 years, 55% women). We hypothesized that any observed association between the AHA score and incident CVD may be mediated by the association between the score and biomarker levels and the presence of subclinical disease. Adjusting for age & sex, an ideal AHA score (non-smoking status, ideal body mass index, regular physical activity, healthy diet, and an optimal profile of total serum cholesterol, blood pressure, and glucose; range 0-7) was associated with: a. higher concentrations of natriuretic peptides (NT-proANP & B-type natriuretic peptide) and lower concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, aldosterone, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, fibrinogen, homocysteine, and growth differentiation factor-15 levels (p<0.001 for all); and b. lower odds of subclinical disease (Odds Ratio 0.73 per unit increase in the AHA score, 95% CI 0.68, 0.80). The incidence of CVD (267 events over 16 years) was inversely associated with the baseline AHA score in age-, sex- adjusted models (Hazards ratio [HR] 0.78 per unit-increase in the AHA score, 95% CI 0.70, 0.86) that was slightly attenuated upon adjustment for biomarkers and subclinical disease (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79, 0.98). Conclusion: In our prospective study of a large community-based sample, an ideal AHA score (indicating ideal cardiovascular health) was inversely associated with the incidence of CVD, an association partly attributable to its favorable impact on CVD biomarker levels and subclinical disease},

Cardiovascular cells also have membrane adenosine receptors. Cell and tissue distributions, signal transduction pathways, and pharmacology of each of the four subtypes of adenosine receptors are subjects of intense investigation. The A1-adenosine receptors mediate the negative dromotropic, chronotropic, inotropic, and the anti-$\beta$-adrenergic actions of adenosine. Activation of A(2A)-and perhaps A(2B)-adenosine receptors causes vasodilation. Evidence of novel actions mediated by A(2B)- and A3-adenosine receptors is accumulating. Adenosine is cardioprotective during episodes of cardiac hypoxia/ischemia; several potential mechanisms may be involved. Pharmacologic tools are currently available for laboratory investigation of the actions of adenosine, and the development of adenosine receptor subtype-selective agonists and antagonists for therapeutic purposes is beginning.},

abstract = {Two women, ages 34 and 36 years, suffered an acute transmural anterior myo-cardial infarction accompanied by typical ECG and serum enzyme changes. At the time of selective cinecoronary arteriography 29 and 57 months later, however, neither had demonstrable narrowing of any coronary artery. Both have persistent ECG changes of an anterior infarct and markedly diminished contractions of a large segment of the anterior wall and apex on left ventriculogram. Neither before nor after infarction has either patient experienced angina pectoris. Both patients are premenopausal, and neither of them has diabetes, hypertension, obesity, valvular heart disease, a lipoprotein abnormality , or a family history of premature coronary arterial disease. Both smoke cigarettes. At the time of infarction one patient was taking an oral contraceptive and the other was 11-days postpartum.

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) has been shown to be attenuated in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and may, therefore, be possibly used for the early detection of myocardial ischemia. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic yield of a novel short-term HRV algorithm for the detection of myocardial ischemia in subjects without known CAD. We prospectively enrolled 450 subjects without known CAD who were referred to tertiary medical centers for exercise stress testing (EST) with single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). All subjects underwent 1-hour Holter testing with subsequent HRV analysis before EST with MPI. The diagnostic yield of HRV analysis was compared with EST, using MPI as the gold standard for the noninvasive detection of myocardial ischemia. All subjects had intermediate pretest probability for CAD. Mean age was 62 years, 38% were women, 51% had hypertension, and 25% diabetes mellitus. HRV analysis showed superior sensitivity (77%) compared with standard EST (27%). After multivariate adjustment, HRV was independently associated with an 8.4-fold (p <0.001) increased likelihood for the detection of myocardial ischemia by MPI, whereas EST did not show a statistically significant association with a positive MPI (odds ratio 2.1; p = 0.12). Of subjects who were referred for subsequent coronary angiography, the respective sensitivities of HRV and EST for the detection of significant CAD were 73% versus 26%. Our data suggest that HRV can be used as an important noninvasive technique for the detection of myocardial ischemia in subjects without known CAD, providing superior sensitivity to conventional EST in this population.},

abstract = {Pharmacologic coronary vasodilation as an adjunct to thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy provides an important alternative form of stress that has been increasingly used in patients unable to perform an exercise stress test. Although dipyridamole has traditionally been used for this purpose, there are several compelling reasons why adenosine may be a preferable agent. First, dipyridamole acts by blocking the reuptake and transport of adenosine, which is the effective substance responsible for coronary vasodilation. Second, exogenous adenosine has a very short half-life (<2 seconds), which explains its very short duration of action as well as the brief, self-limiting duration of its side effects. Third, the adenosine infusion is controllable and may be increased or decreased as desired. Fourth, the coronary vasodilation induced by the doses of adenosine we recommend (140 $\mu$g/kg/min) may be more profound than that induced by the standard dipyridamole dose. Our experience to date, with nearly 1,000 patients studied, shows the adenosine thallium-201 test to be practical and well tolerated, with high sensitivity (87%) and specificity (94%) for detecting coronary artery disease. {\textcopyright} 1991 Reed Publishing USA.},

abstract = {Background��� Blacks have disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease. Psychosocial stress may contribute to this disparity. Previous trials on stress reduction with the Transcendental Meditation (TM) program have reported improvements in cardiovascular disease risk factors, surrogate end points, and mortality in blacks and other populations. Methods and Results��� This was a randomized, controlled trial of 201 black men and women with coronary heart disease who were randomized to the TM program or health education. The primary end point was the composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Secondary end points included the composite of cardiovascular mortality, revascularizations, and cardiovascular hospitalizations; blood pressure; psychosocial stress factors; and lifestyle behaviors. During an average follow-up of 5.4 years, there was a 48% risk reduction in the primary end point in the TM group (hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.29���0.92; P =0.025). The TM group also showed a 24% risk reduction in the secondary end point (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.51���0.1.13; P =0.17). There were reductions of 4.9 mmHg in systolic blood pressure (95% confidence interval ���8.3 to ���1.5 mmHg; P =0.01) and anger expression ( P <0.05 for all scales). Adherence was associated with survival. Conclusions��� A selected mind���body intervention, the TM program, significantly reduced risk for mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke in coronary heart disease patients. These changes were associated with lower blood pressure and psychosocial stress factors. Therefore, this practice may be clinically useful in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiac stress testing, particularly with imaging, has been the focus of debates about rising health care costs, inappropriate use, and patient safety in the context of radiation exposure.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether U.S. trends in cardiac stress test use may be attributable to population shifts in demographics, risk factors, and provider characteristics and evaluate whether racial/ethnic disparities exist in physician decision making.\n\nDESIGN: Analyses of repeated cross-sectional data.\n\nSETTING: National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (1993 to 2010).\n\nPATIENTS: Adults without coronary heart disease.\n\nMEASUREMENTS: Cardiac stress test referrals and inappropriate use.\n\nRESULTS: Between 1993 to 1995 and 2008 to 2010, the annual number of U.S. ambulatory visits in which a cardiac stress test was ordered or performed increased from 28 per 10,000 visits to 45 per 10,000 visits. No trend was found toward more frequent testing after adjustment for patient characteristics, risk factors, and provider characteristics (P = 0.134). Cardiac stress tests with imaging comprised a growing portion of all tests, increasing from 59% in 1993 to 1995 to 87% in 2008 to 2010. At least 34.6% were probably inappropriate, with associated annual costs and harms of $501 million and 491 future cases of cancer. Authors found no evidence of a lower likelihood of black patients receiving a cardiac stress test (odds ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21]) than white patients, although some evidence of disparity in Hispanic patients was found (odds ratio, 0.75 [CI, 0.55 to 1.02]).\n\nLIMITATION: Cross-sectional design with limited clinical data.\n\nCONCLUSION: National growth in cardiac stress test use can largely be explained by population and provider characteristics, but use of imaging cannot. Physician decision making about cardiac stress test use does not seem to contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease.\n\nPRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A limitation of stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is the inability to detect non-obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). One advantage of MPI with a hybrid CT device is the ability to obtain same-setting measurement of the coronary artery calcium score (CACS). METHODS AND RESULTS: Utilizing our single-center nuclear database, we identified 760 consecutive patients with: (1) no CAD history; (2) a normal clinically indicated Rb-82 PET/CT stress perfusion study; and (3) a same-setting CAC scan. 487 of 760 patients (64.1%) had subclinical CAD based on an abnormal CACS. Of those with CAC, the CACS was > or =100, > or =400, and > or =1000 in 47.0%, 22.4%, and 8.4% of patients, respectively. Less than half of the patients with CAC were receiving aspirin or statin medications prior to PET/CT imaging. Patients with CAC were more likely to be initiated or optimized on proven medical therapy for CAD immediately following PET/CT MPI compared to those without CAC. CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical CAD is common in patients without known CAD and normal myocardial perfusion assessed by hybrid PET/CT imaging. Identification of CAC influences subsequent physician prescribing patterns such that those with CAC are more likely to be treated with proven medical therapy for the treatment of CAD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Young women with coronary heart disease have high rates of depression and a higher risk of adverse events than men of similar age. Whether depression has a higher prognostic value in this group than in men and older women is not known. Our objective was to assess whether depression in young women is associated with higher risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and adverse outcomes compared with similarly aged men and older women. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined 3237 patients undergoing coronary angiography for evaluation of CAD and followed them for 2.9 years (median). Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9, and CAD burden was dichotomized based on its presence or absence. After multivariable adjustment for CAD risk factors, depressive symptoms predicted CAD presence in women aged ≤ 55 years (odds ratio=1.07 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 to 1.13 per 1 point increase in PHQ-9 score), but not in men aged ≤ 55 years or women aged >55 years. Depressive symptoms also predicted increased risk of death in women aged ≤ 55 years (adjusted hazard ratio=1.07, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.14, per 1 point increase in PHQ-9 score), but not in men aged ≤ 55 years and women aged >55 years, with P=0.02 for the depression-sex interaction and P=0.02 for depression-sex-age interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with suspected or established CAD, depressive symptoms are associated with increased risk of death, particularly in young women. This group may be especially vulnerable to the adverse cardiovascular effects of depression.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The study aim was to determine observational differences in costs of care by the coronary disease diagnostic test modality. BACKGROUND: A number of diagnostic strategies are available with few data to compare the cost implications of the initial test choice. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 11,372 consecutive stable angina patients who were referred for stress myocardial perfusion tomography or cardiac catheterization. Stress imaging patients were matched by their pretest clinical risk of coronary disease to a series of patients referred to cardiac catheterization. Composite 3-year costs of care were compared for two patients management strategies: 1) direct cardiac catheterization (aggressive) and 2) initial stress myocardial perfusion tomography and selective catheterization of high risk patients (conservative). Analysis of variance techniques were used to compare costs, adjusting for treatment propensity and pretest risk. RESULTS: Observational comparisons of aggressive as compared with conservative testing strategies reveal that costs of care were higher for direct cardiac catheterization in all clinical risk subsets (range: $2,878 to $4,579), as compared with stress myocardial perfusion imaging plus selective catheterization (range: $2,387 to $3,010, p < 0.0001). Coronary revascularization rates were higher for low, intermediate and high risk direct catheterization patients as compared with the initial stress perfusion imaging cohort (13% to 50%, p < 0.0001); cardiac death or myocardial infarction rates were similar (p > 0.20). CONCLUSIONS: Observational assessments reveal that stable chest pain patients who undergo a more aggressive diagnostic strategy have higher diagnostic costs and greater rates of intervention and follow-up costs. Cost differences may reflect a diminished necessity for resource consumption for patients with normal test results.},

Methods for defining target populations, identifying dimensions of care, synthesizing the literature, and operationalizing the process of selecting measures are proposed.

abstract = {UNLABELLED Abnormal exercise perfusion findings have been described as false-positive for coronary artery disease in patients with suspected angina and angiographically normal coronary arteries. METHODS The significance of this finding was further investigated by obtaining intravascular sonograms and Doppler guidewire measurements of at least 2 coronary arteries in 20 consecutive patients who had chest pain, normal coronary angiography findings, and positive stress-rest sestamibi SPECT findings. The summed reversible score was used to describe the extent and severity of reversible perfusion defects. On the basis of scintigraphy findings, vessels were grouped as supplying underperfused myocardial segments (target vessels, n = 20) or normal territories (reference vessels, n = 25). The presence and extension of atherosclerotic disease of the epicardial arteries were assessed by intracoronary sonography. Measurements of plaque area (PA), vessel area (VA), and relative cross-sectional PA (RPA) (RPA = PA/VA) were obtained at the site of maximum plaque concentration. The coronary flow velocity reserve (CFR) was assessed during adenosine-induced hyperemia, and the relative flow reserve was calculated as the target-to-reference coronary reserve ratio. RESULTS The median summed reversible score was 3 (range, 1-6). Intracoronary sonography showed occult atherosclerosis in 19 patients (95%), with RPA greater than 40% in 16 patients (80%). Mean RPA was significantly greater in the target vessels (46% +/- 14%) than in reference vessels (12% +/- 18%; P < 0.0001). Doppler flow velocity measurements showed abnormal vasodilation capacity (CFR < 2.5) in 14 patients (70%). Mean CFR was significantly lower in the target vessels than in the reference vessels (2.3 +/- 0.5 versus 3.1 +/- 0.6; P < 0.0001). A significant inverse correlation was seen between the summed reversible score and the coronary reserve ratio (y = 9.05x - 9.9; r = 0.70; P < 0.005). CONCLUSION Reversible perfusion defects seen on SPECT images are often associated with angiographically unrecognized occult atherosclerotic changes and an abnormal vasodilation capacity of the coronary circulation. The tendency to dismiss abnormal exercise perfusion findings as false-positive in these patients may be unjustified.},

Pre- and post-test probabilities of coronary artery disease were computed for diagnostic tests and each test was also assigned as diagnostic or part of management. Diagnostic strategies defined were. 1: Exercise electrocardiogram/coronary angiography, 2: exercise electrocardiogram/myocardial perfusion imaging/coronary angiography, 3: myocardial perfusion imaging/coronary angiography, 4: coronary angiography. Primary outcome measures were the cost and accuracy of diagnosis, the cost of subsequent management, and clinical outcome. Secondary measures included prognostic power, normal angiography rate, and rate of angiography not followed by revascularization. Results. Mean diagnostic costs per patient were: strategy 1: {\pounds}490, 2: {\pounds}409, 3: {\pounds}460, 4: {\pounds}1253 (P < 0.0001). Myocardial perfusion imaging users: {\pounds}529, non-users {\pounds}667 (P= 0.006). Mean probability of the presence of corollary artery disease when the final clinical diagnosis was coronary artery disease present were, strategy 1: 0.85, 2: 0.82, 3: 0.97, 4: 1.0 (P < 0.0001), users 0.93, non-users 0.88 (P = 0.02), and when coronary artery disease was absent, 1: 0.26, 2: 0.22, 3: 0.16, 4: 0.0 (P < 0.0001), users 0.21, non-users 0.20 (P = ns). Total 2-year costs (coronary artery disease present/absent) were: strategy 1: {\pounds}4453/{\pounds}710, 2: {\pounds}3842/{\pounds}478, 3: {\pounds}3768/{\pounds}574, 4: {\pounds}5599/{\pounds}1475 (P < 0.05/0.0001), users: {\pounds}5563/{\pounds}623, non-users: {\pounds}5428/{\pounds}916 (P = ns/0.001). Prognostic power at diagnosis was higher (P < 0.0001) and normal coronary angiography rate lower (P = 0.07) in the scintigraphic centres and strategies. Numbers of soft and hard cardiac events over 2 years and final symptomatic status did not differ between strategy or centre. Conclusion. Investigative strategies using myocardial perfusion imaging are cheaper and equally effective when compared with strategies that do not use myocardial perfusion imaging, both for cost of diagnosis and for overall 2 year management costs. Two year patient outcome is the same.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the absence of significant coronary stenoses, stress-induced myocardial perfusion abnormalities at gated single photon emission computed tomography (g-SPECT) are usually considered to be a 'false-positive' result. Our goal was to investigate how false-positive g-SPECT perfusion abnormalities relate to cardiovascular risk factors and whether they provide any prognostic information.\n\nMETHODS: From 1999 to 2005, a group of 130 anginal patients with myocardial perfusion abnormalities at stress g-SPECT, with normal coronary angiography or less than 50% lumen reduction and with a left ventricular ejection fraction more than 0.45, was selected. The extent of myocardial perfusion abnormalities after stress was quantified using the summed difference score (SDS).\n\nRESULTS: Using a logistic regression model, it was found that cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, smoking habit, hypercholesterolemia and obesity) were closely related (r = 0.96) to the SDS. During a 44 +/- 7-month follow-up, six patients experienced nonfatal cardiac events. An SDS more than 7 (P < 0.0001) and diabetes mellitus (P < 0.0001) were the only independent predictors of event-free survival using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.\n\nCONCLUSION: In patients with anginal-like chest pain and without significant coronary stenoses, stress-induced myocardial perfusion abnormalities at g-SPECT correlate with cardiovascular risk factors and are independent predictors of the few, minor adverse cardiac events during the follow-up.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis has been shown to be a predictor of sudden cardiac death and all-cause mortality in patients with cardiac disease. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether newer HRV analysis algorithms, as used by the HeartTrends device, are superior to exercise stress testing (EST) for the detection of myocardial ischemia in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: We present pilot data of the first 100 subjects enrolled in a clinical trial designed to evaluate the yield of short-term (1 hour) HRV testing for the detection of myocardial ischemia. The study population comprised subjects without known CAD referred to a tertiary medical center for EST with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). All patients underwent a 1 hour electrocardiographic acquisition for HRV analysis with a HeartTrends device prior to ESTwith MPI. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) were calculated for EST and HRV analysis, using MPI as the gold standard for the non-invasive detection of myocardial ischemia. RESULTS: In this cohort 15% had a pathologic MPI result. HRV analysis showed superior sensitivity (85%), PPV (50%) and NPV (97%) as compared to standard EST (53%, 42%, 90%, respectively), while the specificity of the two tests was similar (86% and 85%, respectively). The close agreement between HRV and MPI was even more pronounced among patients > 65 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot data suggest that the diagnostic yield of the novel HeartTrends HRV algorithm is superior to conventional EST for the non-invasive detection of myocardial ischemia.},

abstract = {Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) with adenosine-stress myocardial perfusion is gaining importance for the detection and quantification of coronary artery disease (CAD). However, there is little knowledge about patients with CMR-detected ischemia, but having no relevant stenosis as seen on coronary angiography (CA). The aims of our study were to characterize these patients by CMR and CA and evaluate correlations and potential reasons for the ischemic findings. 73 patients with an indication for CA were first scanned on a 1.5T whole-body CMR-scanner including adenosine-stress first-pass perfusion. The images were analyzed by two independent investigators for myocardial perfusion which was classified as subendocardial ischemia (n = 22), no perfusion deficit (n = 27, control 1), or more than subendocardial ischemia (n = 24, control 2). All patients underwent CA, and a highly significant correlation between the classification of CMR perfusion deficit and the degree of coronary luminal narrowing was found. For quantification of coronary blood flow, corrected Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) frame count (TFC) was evaluated for the left anterior descending (LAD), circumflex (LCX) and right coronary artery (RCA). The main result was that corrected TFC in all coronaries was significantly increased in study patients compared to both control 1 and to control 2 patients. Study patients had hypertension or diabetes more often than control 1 patients. In conclusion, patients with CMR detected subendocardial ischemia have prolonged coronary blood flow. In connection with normal resting flow values in CAD, this supports the hypothesis of underlying coronary microvascular impairment. CMR stress perfusion differentiates non-invasively between this entity and relevant CAD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Patients with obstructive (≥50% stenosis) left main (LM) coronary artery disease (CAD) are at high risk for adverse events; prior studies have also documented worse outcomes among women than men with severe multivessel/LM CAD. However, the prognostic significance of nonobstructive (1%-49% stenosis) LM CAD, including sex-specific differences, has not been previously examined. METHODS AND RESULTS In the long-term CONFIRM (Coronary CT Angiography Evaluation For Clinical Outcomes: An International Multicenter) registry, patients underwent elective coronary computed tomographic angiography for suspected CAD and were followed for 5 years. After excluding those with obstructive LM CAD, 5166 patients were categorized as having normal LM or nonobstructive LM (18% of cohort). Cumulative 5-year incidence of death, myocardial infarction, or revascularization was higher among patients with nonobstructive LM than normal LM in both women and men: women (34.3% versus 15.4%; P<0.0001); men (24.6% versus 18.2%; P<0.0001). A significant interaction existed between sex and LM status for the composite outcome (P=0.001). In multivariable Cox regression, the presence of nonobstructive LM plaque increased the risk for the composite outcome in women (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.48; P=0.005) but not in men (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.98, P=0.806). In subgroup analysis, women with nonobstructive LM CAD had a nearly 80% higher risk for events than men with nonobstructive LM CAD (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.78; P=0.017); sex-specific interactions were not observed across other patterns (eg, location or extent) of nonobstructive plaque. CONCLUSION Nonobstructive LM CAD was frequently detected on coronary computed tomographic angiography and strongly associated with adverse events among women. Recognizing the sex-specific prognostic significance of nonobstructive LM plaque may augment risk stratification efforts.},

abstract = {Objectives: This study sought to examine the relationship between inflammation and coronary microvascular function in asymptomatic individuals using positron emission tomography (PET) and assessment of coronary flow reserve (CFR). Background: Coronary microvascular dysfunction is an early precursor of coronary artery disease (CAD) thought to result from endothelial cell activation and inflammation, but data are limited. Methods: We examined 268 asymptomatic male monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Plasma biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial cell activation included C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, white blood cell count (WBC), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. Blood flow quantitation was obtained with [13N] ammonia PET at rest and after adenosine stress. CFR was measured as the ratio of maximum flow to baseline flow at rest; abnormal CFR was defined as a ratio <2.5. A summed stress score for visible perfusion defects was calculated. Results: In within-pair analyses, all biomarkers, except VCAM-1, were higher in twins with lower CFR than their brothers with higher CFR (p < 0.05). This was observed in the entire sample, as well as within pairs discordant for a CFR of <2.5. Associations persisted after adjusting for summed stress score and CAD risk factors. In contrast no biomarker, except IL-6, was related to the summed stress score of visible defects. Conclusions: Even in asymptomatic subjects, a decrease in coronary microvascular function is accompanied by a systemic inflammatory response, independent of CAD risk factors. Our results, using a controlled twin design, highlight the importance of coronary microvascular function in the early phases of CAD. {\textcopyright} 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {Decreased heart rate (HR) variability is associated with increased mortality after myocardial infarction, but the prognostic value of HR variability in patients without recent myocardial infarction and its correlation with other clinical and angiographic data have not previously been reported. In the present study, detailed clinical assessments and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were performed prospectively on 100 patients undergoing elective coronary angiography. HR variability was inversely correlated with HR (r = -0.38, p = 0.0001), diabetes mellitus (r = -0.22, p = 0.025) and digoxin use (r = -0.29, p = 0.004), but not with left ventricular ejection fraction, extent of coronary artery disease or other clinical, electrocardiographic or angiographic variables. All patients were followed for 1 year. Major clinical events after initial discharge occurred in 10 patients and included 6 deaths and 4 coronary bypass operations. Left ventricular ejection fraction was the only variable that correlated with the occurrence of a clinical event (p = 0.002). Decreased HR variability and ejection fraction were the best predictors of mortality (both p < 0.01), and the contribution of HR variability to mortality was independent of ejection fraction, extent of coronary artery disease and other variables. Furthermore, 11 patients with HR variability <50 ms had an 18-fold increase in mortality compared with patients with HR variability >50 ms (36 vs 2%, p = 0.001). Thus, decreased HR variability is a potent independent predictor of mortality in the 12 months following elective coronary angiography in patients without recent myocardial infarction. {\textcopyright} 1988.},
