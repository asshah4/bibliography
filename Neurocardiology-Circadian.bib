abstract = {Population multiple components is a statistical tool useful for the analysis of time-dependent hybrid data. With a small number of parameters, it is possible to model and to predict the periodic behavior of a population. In this article, we propose two methods to compare among populations rhythmometric parameters obtained by multiple component analysis. The first is a parametric method based in the usual statistical techniques for comparison of mean vectors in multivariate normal populations. The method, through MANOVA analysis, allows comparison of the MESOR and amplitude-acrophase pair of each component among two or more populations. The second is a nonparametric method, based in bootstrap techniques, to compare parameters from two populations. This test allows one to compare the MESOR, the amplitude, and the acrophase of each fitted component, as well as the global amplitude, orthophase, and bathyphase estimated when all fitted components are harmonics of a fundamental period. The idea is to calculate a confidence interval for the difference of the parameters of interest. If this interval does not contain zero, it can be concluded that the parameters from the two models are different with high probability. An estimation of p-value for the corresponding test can also be calculated. Both methods are illustrated with an example, based on clinical data. The nonparametric test can also be applied to paired data, a special situation of great interest in practice. By the use of similar bootstrap techniques, we illustrate how to construct confidence intervals for any rhythmometric parameter estimated from population multiple components models, including the orthophase, bathyphase, and global amplitude. These tests for comparison of parameters among populations are a needed tool when modeling the nonsinusoidal rhythmic behavior of hybrid data by population multiple component analysis.},

abstract = {Background: Depression is associated with an increased risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation, proinflammatory processes, and procoagulant processes have been suggested as possible explanations. Methods: Heart rate variability (HRV), an indicator of cardiac autonomic regulation, and markers of inflammation [C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$)] and coagulation (fibrinogen) were assessed in 44 depressed patients with CHD. Results: Moderate, negative correlations were found between fibrinogen and four measures of HRV. IL-6 also negatively correlated with one measure of HRV (total power) and was marginally related to two others (very low frequency and low frequency power). Neither CRP nor TNF-$\alpha$ was significantly related to any measure of HRV. Conclusions: The finding that fibrinogen and IL-6 are moderately related to HRV suggests a link between these factors in depressed CHD patients. The relationship between ANS function and inflammatory and coagulant processes should be investigated in larger mechanistic studies of depression and cardiac morbidity and mortality. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Summary Previous studies have found a U?shaped relationship between mortality and (weekday) sleep duration. We here address the association of both weekday and weekend sleep duration with overall mortality. A cohort of 43,880 subjects was followed for 13 years through record?linkages. Cox proportional hazards regression models with attained age as time?scale were fitted to estimate multivariable?adjusted hazard ratios and 95{\%} confidence intervals for mortality; stratified analyses on age ({\textless}65 years, ≥65 years) were conducted. Among individuals {\textless}65 years old, short sleep (≤5 hr) during weekends at baseline was associated with a 52{\%} higher mortality rate (hazard ratios 1.52; 95{\%} confidence intervals 1.15?2.02) compared with the reference group (7 hr), while no association was observed for long (≥9 hr) weekend sleep. When, instead, different combinations of weekday and weekend sleep durations were analysed, we observed a detrimental association with consistently sleeping ≤5 hr (hazard ratios 1.65; 95{\%} confidence intervals 1.22?2.23) or ≥8 hr (hazard ratios 1.25; 95{\%} confidence intervals 1.05?1.50), compared with consistently sleeping 6?7 hr per day (reference). The mortality rate among participants with short sleep during weekdays, but long sleep during weekends, did not differ from the rate of the reference group. Among individuals ≥65 years old, no association between weekend sleep or weekday/weekend sleep durations and mortality was observed. In conclusion, short, but not long, weekend sleep was associated with an increased mortality in subjects {\textless}65 years. In the same age group, short sleep (or long sleep) on both weekdays and weekend showed increased mortality. Possibly, long weekend sleep may compensate for short weekday sleep.},

abstract = {The circadian system regulates physiology and behavior. Acute challenges to the system, such as those experienced when traveling across time zones, will eventually result in re-synchronization to local environmental time cues, but this re-synchronization is oftentimes accompanied by adverse short-term consequences. When such challenges are experienced chronically, adaptation may not be achieved, as for example in the case of rotating night shift workers. The transient and chronic disturbance of the circadian system is most frequently referred to as “circadian disruption”, but many other terms have been proposed and used to refer to similar situations. It is now beyond doubt that the circadian system contributes to health and disease, emphasizing the need for clear terminology when describing challenges to the circadian system and their consequences. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of the terms used to describe disruption of the circadian system, discuss proposed quantifications of disruption in experimental and observational settings with a focus on human research, and highlight limitations and challenges of currently available tools. For circadian research to advance as a translational science, clear, operationalizable, and scalable quantifications of circadian disruption are key, as they will enable improved assessment and reproducibility of results, ideally ranging from mechanistic settings, including animal research, to large-scale randomized clinical trials.},

abstract = {The frequency of adverse cardiovascular events is greater in the morning compared to its 24-hour average. A circadian variation in the regulation of the cardiovascular system could contribute to this increased cardiovascular risk in the morning. Indeed, circadian rhythms have been shown for a wide array of physiological processes. Using an ultradian sleep-wake cycle (USW) procedure, we sought to determine how heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) correlate with the well-characterized circadian rhythms of cortisol and melatonin secretion. Specific HRV components, namely the low frequency (LF) power, high frequency (HF) power, and the LF:HF ratio can be used as markers of the autonomic modulation of the heart. Cross-correlation between HRV parameters and hormonal rhythms demonstrated that mean RR interval is significantly phase-advanced relative to salivary cortisol and urinary 6-sulfatoxy-melatonin (UaMt6s). Parasympathetic modulation of the heart (HF power) was phase-advanced relative to cortisol, but was in-phase with UaMt6s levels. Maximal correlation of the sympathovagal balance (the LF:HF ratio) had no significant lag compared to cortisol secretion and UaMt6s excretion. The protective effect of the parasympathetic nervous system at night, combined with the putative risk associated with the sympathetic nervous system peaking in the morning, could be associated with the increased cardiovascular risk observed in the morning hours.},

abstract = {Circadian misalignment is hypothesized to contribute to increased diabetes and obesity among shift workers and individuals with late sleep timing. Accordingly, the goal of our study was to identify—among normal and overweight/obese adults—associations between circadian timing (dim light melatonin onset; DLMO) and circadian misalignment (the interval between DLMO and sleep onset) with metabolic disease risk. This was a secondary analysis of data from a larger study. Participants ages 18 to 50 years without depression, diabetes, or shift work, with sleep duration 6.5 h or more, completed the following evaluations: 7 days of wrist actigraphy, circadian timing assessment (DLMO), and a fasting blood draw to measure glucose and insulin and calculate the Homeostatic Model of Assessment–Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). Data were analyzed using correlation and regression analyses controlling for age, sex, DLMO, and sleep duration. Analyses were conducted for the entire sample (n = 54) and stratified by normal weight (n = 36) and overweight/obese groups (n = 18). Mean age was 26.4 years (SD = 7.1 years). Average sleep duration was 436.2 min (SD = 55.1 min), DLMO was 2250h (SD = 01:31), and interval between DLMO and sleep onset was 2 h 18 min (SD = 53 min). Average BMI was 24.3 kg/m2 (SD = 4.5 kg/m2). Circadian timing and interval between DLMO and sleep onset were not associated with glucose, insulin, or HOMA-IR in the main analyses. Among overweight/obese participants, a shorter interval between DLMO and sleep onset was associated with higher insulin (B[SE] = −5.12 [2.24], p = 0.04) and HOMA-IR (B[SE] = −1.32 [0.57], p = 0.04). Results of our multivariable model indicated that among overweight/obese participants, insulin was 5.1 pmol/L higher and HOMA was 1.3 µU/mL higher for every hour closer that sleep onset was to DLMO. The strengths of this study include the use of objective measures of circadian timing, but results should be considered hypothesis generating due to the small sample size and use of subgroup analyses.},

abstract = {Diurnal variation of depressive symptoms appears to be part of the core of depression. Yet, longitudinal investigation of an individual's pattern, regularity, relation to clinical state, and clinical improvement reveals little homogeneity. Morning lows, afternoon slump, evening worsening - all can occur during a single depressive episode. Mood variability, or the propensity to produce mood swings, appears to be the characteristic that most predicts capacity to respond to treatment. Laboratory studies have revealed that mood, like physiological variables such as core body temperature, is regulated by a circadian clock interacting with the sleep homeostat. Many depressed patients, particularly bipolar patients, show delayed sleep phase (late chronotype). Even small shifts in the timing and duration of sleep affect mood state (sleep deprivation and sleep phase advance have an antidepressant effect). The implications for treatment are to stabilize mood state by enhancing synchronization of the sleep-wake cycle with the biological clock (eg, ith light therapy). {\textcopyright} 2008, LLS SAS.},

abstract = {Background: Annual patterns in suicide rates, peaking near the summer solstice, are well documented. It has been suggested that day length or total hours of sunshine has an impact on suicide rates. If these environmental factors are involved, we would expect changes in the daily pattern of suicide rates to occur over the year. To test this hypothesis, the 24-h patterns of suicide rate were investigated as a function of time of year. Method: Detailed information about the exact time of suicides in The Netherlands is only available for train suicides. Therefore, information concerning age, sex, time and place of occurrence of all verified train suicides over 15 years in The Netherlands (n = 2830) was obtained from The Netherlands Railways archives. Results: Daily patterns in train suicides show systematic variations of two kinds. First, independently of time of year, suicide rates at night drop to about 10{\%} of their daytime values. Second, there are two daily peaks in the patterns which shift their timing over the year, with one peak occurring shortly after sunset, and the other one consistently occurring 9-10 h earlier. Both peaks shift with the 5.5-h shift in sunset time. Limitations: Train suicidal behaviour may not represent fatal suicidal behaviour in general. Conclusions: There are pronounced and systematic daily variations in train suicide rates in The Netherlands. One of these is related to clock time, the others are related to the light-dark cycle. The consistency of the patterns suggests a strong environmental influence on train suicidal behaviour. Research on 24-h patterns of suicide rates should control for time of year. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Cortisol has one of the most distinct and fascinating circadian rhythms in human physiology. This is regulated by the central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. It has been suggested that cortisol acts as a secondary messenger between central and peripheral clocks, hence its importance in the synchronization of body circadian rhythms. Conventional immediate-release hydrocortisone, either at twice- or thrice-daily doses, is not capable of replicating physiological cortisol circadian rhythm and patients with adrenal insufficiency or congenital adrenal hyperplasia still suffer from a poor quality of life and increased mortality. Novel treatments for replacement therapy are therefore essential. Proof-of-concept studies using hydrocortisone infusions suggest that the circadian delivery of hydrocortisone may improve biochemical control and life quality in patients lacking cortisol with an impaired cortisol rhythm. Recently oral formulations of modified-release hydrocortisone are being developed and it has been shown that it is possible to replicate cortisol circadian rhythm and also achieve better control of morning androgen levels. These new drug therapies are promising and potentially offer a more effective treatment with less adverse effects. Definite improvements clearly need to be established in future clinical trials.},

abstract = {Background--Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is associated with adverse prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), yet the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. We hypothesized that compared with exercise/pharmacological stress-induced myocardial ischemia (PSIMI) that is secondary to the atherosclerotic burden of CAD, MSIMI is primarily due to vasomotor changes. Methods and Results--Patients with angiographically documented CAD underwent 99mTc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest and following both mental and physical stress testing, performed on separate days. The severity and extent of CAD were quantified using the Gensini and Sullivan scores. Peripheral arterial tonometry (Itamar Inc) was used to assess the digital microvascular tone during mental stress as a ratio of pulse wave amplitude during speech compared with baseline. Measurements were made in a discovery sample (n=225) and verified in a replication sample (n=159). In the pooled (n=384) sample, CAD severity and extent scores were not significantly different between those with and without MSIMI, whereas they were greater in those with compared with those without PSIMI (P {\textless} 0.04 for all). The peripheral arterial tonometry ratio was lower in those with compared with those without MSIMI (0.55±0.36 versus 0.76±0.52, P=0.009). In a multivariable analysis, the peripheral arterial tonometry ratio was the only independent predictor of MSIMI (P=0.009), whereas angiographic severity and extent of CAD independently predicted PSIMI. Conclusions--The degree of digital microvascular constriction, and not the angiographic burden of CAD, is associated with MSIMI. Varying causes of MSIMI compared with PSIMI may require different therapeutic interventions that require further study.},

abstract = {Increased platelet aggregation in the morning and upon assuming an upright posture may account at least in part for the observed circadian variation in onset of acute myocardial infarction. The Physicians' Health Study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of alternate-day aspirin intake (325 mg) among 22,071 US male physicians, afforded the opportunity to assess this circadian pattern and examine whether it is altered by aspirin therapy. During a 5-year period of follow-up, 342 cases of nonfatal myocardial infarction were confirmed, of which the time of onset was available in 211 (62{\%}). The placebo group showed a bimodal circadian variation in onset of myocardial infarction with a primary peak between 4:00 AM and 10:00 AM (p less than 0.001). In the aspirin group, however, this circadian variation was minimal (p = 0.16), due primarily to a marked reduction in the morning peak of infarction. Specifically, aspirin was associated with a 59.3{\%} reduction in the incidence of infarction during the morning waking hours, compared with a 34.1{\%} reduction for the remaining hours of the day. The greater reduction was observed during the 3-hour interval immediately after awakening, a period with a risk of infarction twice that of any other comparable time interval (p less than 0.001). Aspirin intake was associated with a mean reduction in the incidence of infarction of 44.8{\%} over the entire 24-hour cycle. These data support the hypothesis that increased platelet aggregability in the morning and upon arising contributes to the occurrence of myocardial infarction and that aspirin reduces the risk of infarction by inhibiting platelet aggregation during these critical periods.},

abstract = {The circadian clock governs virtually all processes in the human body, including sleep-wake behaviour. Circadian misalignment describes the off-set between sleep-wake cycles and clock-regulated physiology. This strain is predominantly caused by external (societal) demands including shift work, early school start times and fast travels across time zones. Sleeping at the 'wrong' internal time can jeopardise health and safety, and we therefore need a good quantification of this phenomenon. Here, we propose a novel method to quantify the mistiming of sleep-wake rhythms and demonstrate its versatility in day workers and shift workers. Based on a single time series, our Composite Phase Deviation method unveils distinct, subject-and schedule-specific geometries (islands and pancakes') that illustrate how modern work times interfere with sleep. With increasing levels of circadian strain, the resulting shapes change systematically from small, connected forms to large and fragmented patterns. Our method shows good congruence with published measures of circadian misalignment (i.e., Inter-daily Stability and Behavioural Entrainment'), but offers added value as to its requirements, e.g., being computable for sleep logs and questionnaires. Composite Phase Deviations will help to understand the mechanisms that link living against the clock' with health and disease on an individual basis.},

abstract = {The risk of adverse cardiovascular events peaks in the morning (≈9:00 AM) with a secondary peak in the evening (≈8:00 PM) and a trough at night. This pattern is generally believed to be caused by the day/night distribution of behavioral triggers, but it is unknown whether the endogenous circadian system contributes to these daily fluctuations. Thus, we tested the hypotheses that the circadian system modulates autonomic, hemodynamic, and hemostatic risk markers at rest, and that behavioral stressors have different effects when they occur at different internal circadian phases. Twelve healthy adults were each studied in a 240-h forced desynchrony protocol in dim light while standardized rest and exercise periods were uniformly distributed across the circadian cycle. At rest, there were large circadian variations in plasma cortisol (peak-to-trough ≈85{\%} of mean, peaking at a circadian phase corresponding to ≈9:00 AM) and in circulating catecholamines (epinephrine, ≈70{\%}; norepinephrine, ≈35{\%}, peaking during the biological day). At ≈8:00 PM, there was a circadian peak in blood pressure and a trough in cardiac vagal modulation. Sympathetic variables were consistently lowest and vagal markers highest during the biological night. We detected no simple circadian effect on hemostasis, although platelet aggregability had two peaks: at ≈noon and ≈11:00 PM. There was circadian modulation of the cardiovascular reactivity to exercise, with greatest vagal withdrawal at ≈9:00 AM and peaks in catecholamine reactivity at ≈9:00 AM and ≈9:00 PM. Thus, the circadian system modulates numerous cardiovascular risk markers at rest as well as their reactivity to exercise, with resultant profiles that could potentially contribute to the day/night pattern of adverse cardiovascular events.},

abstract = {Desynchronisation of normal circadian rhythms, including the sleep-wake rhythm, is common in major depressive disorder (MDD). The association between sleep disturbances and depression has long been recognised. Disturbed sleep is a diagnostic criterion for MDD, and insomnia commonly precedes the onset of symptomatic mood disorders. Disruptions of the sleep-wake cycle (sleep architecture and timing) are residual symptoms that may prevent the attainment of high-quality remission and delay recovery from MDD. Therefore, early recognition and treatment of sleep disturbances may be important for the treatment and prevention of recurrent depression. Evidence suggests that melatonergic (MT(1) and MT(2)) and the 5-HT(2C) serotonergic receptor subtypes are important modulators of circadian rhythmicity. Agomelatine is the first melatonergic antidepressant; an agonist of melatonin MT(1) and MT(2) receptors, with additional antagonist properties at the 5-HT(2C) receptors. Agomelatine combines antidepressant efficacy including quality and efficiency of sleep, with a more favourable side-effect profile than current antidepressant treatments, including neutral effects on sexual function, bodyweight and the absence of discontinuation symptoms. These positive features provide a novel approach to the treatment of depression and the attainment of high-quality remission in MDD.},

abstract = {Circadian rhythms are internal manifestations of the solar day that permit adaptations to predictable environmental temporal changes. These {\~{}}24-h rhythms are controlled by molecular clockworks within the brain that are reset daily to precisely 24 h by exposure to the light–dark cycle. Information from the master clock in the mammalian hypothalamus conveys temporal information to the entire body via humoral and neural communication. A bidirectional relationship exists between mood disorders and circadian rhythms. Mood disorders are often associated with disrupted circadian clock-controlled responses, such as sleep and cortisol secretion, whereas disruption of circadian rhythms via jet lag, night-shift work, or exposure to artificial light at night, can precipitate or exacerbate affective symptoms in susceptible individuals. Evidence suggests strong associations between circadian rhythms and mental health, but only recently have studies begun to discover the direct interactions between the circadian system and mood regulation. This review provides an overview of disrupted circadian rhythms and the relationship to behavioral health and psychiatry. The focus of this review is delineating the role of disruption of circadian rhythms on mood disorders using human night shift studies, as well as jet lag studies to identify links. We also review animal models of disrupted circadian rhythms on affective responses. Lastly, we propose low-cost behavioral and lifestyle changes to improve circadian rhythms and presumably behavioral health.},

abstract = {Objectives. This study sought to define the effects of age and gender effects on the normal range of time domain heart rate variability (HRV) over nine decades in healthy subjects. Background. Low HRV is considered an independent marker of mortality risk. However, the age-related decline in HRV may limit its predictive value, particularly in the elderly. Delineation of the range of HRV in healthy subjects over the life span is needed. Gender- related differences in HRV also need clarification. Methods. We determined, according to decade, 24-h heart rate (HR) and HRV of 260 healthy subjects (10 to 99 years old; 112 male, 148 female) by means of five standard time domain measures: standard deviation of all normal sinus RR intervals over 24 h (SDNN), standard deviation of the averaged normal sinus RR intervals for all 5-mm segments (SDANN), mean of the standard deviations of all normal sinus RR intervals for all 5-min segments (SDNN index), root-mean-square of successive normal sinus RR interval difference (rMSSD) and the percentage of successive normal sinus RR intervals {\textgreater}50 ms (pNN50). Results. 1) HRV decreased with aging, the pattern of change being measure dependent. HRV (SDNN and SDANN) decreased only very gradually, reaching 60{\%} of baseline (second-decade values) by the tenth decade. With the SDNN index, HRV decreased linearly with aging, reaching 46{\%} of baseline by the tenth decade. Using pNN50 and rMSSD, HRV decreased most rapidly, reaching 24{\%} and 47{\%} of baseline, respectively, by the sixth decade and then stabilized. 2) Using the SDNN index, rMSSD and pNN50, HRV of subjects {\textgreater}65 years old fell below published cutpoints for increased risk of mortality in 25{\%}, 12{\%} and 4{\%}, respectively. 3) At age {\textless}30 years, HRV for all measures was lower in female than male subjects. Gender differences decreased at age {\textgreater}30 years and disappeared at age {\textgreater}50 years. 4) HR also declined with aging but much more slowly. HR at age {\textless}50 years was faster in female than in male subjects. Gender differences disappeared thereafter. Conclusions. 1) Using all measures, HRV of healthy subjects declines with aging, with measure-dependent patterns. 2) Using the SDNN index, rMSSD and pNN50, HRV of healthy subjects, particularly those {\textgreater}65 years old, may decrease to below levels associated with increased risk of mortality. 3)Gender influences HRV. Gender differences in HRV are age and measure dependent. 4) Age and gender also affect heart rate.},

Conceived as a regression problem, the method is applicable to non-equidistant data, a major advantage. Another dividend is the feasibility of deriving confidence intervals for parameters of rhythmic components of known periods, readily drawn from the least squares procedure, stressing the importance of prior (external) information. Originally developed for the analysis of short and sparse data series, the extended cosinor has been further developed for the analysis of long time series, focusing both on rhythm detection and parameter estimation. Attention is given to the assumptions underlying the use of the cosinor and ways to determine whether they are satisfied. In particular, ways of dealing with non-stationary data are presented. Examples illustrate the use of the different cosinor-based methods, extending their application from the study of circadian rhythms to the mapping of broad time structures (chronomes). {\textcopyright} 2014 Cornelissen; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {The functional organization of the cardiovascular system shows clear circadian rhythmicity. These and other circadian rhythms at all levels of organization are orchestrated by a central biological clock, the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus. Preservation of the normal circadian time structure from the level of the cardiomyocyte to the organ system appears to be essential for cardiovascular health and cardiovascular disease prevention. Myocardial ischemia, acute myocardial infarct, and sudden cardiac death are much greater in incidence than expected in the morning. Moreover, supraventricular and ventricular cardiac arrhythmias of various types show specific day-night patterns, with atrial arrhythmias - premature beats, tachycardias, atrial fibrillation, and flutter - generally being of higher frequency during the day than night - and ventricular fibrillation and ventricular premature beats more common, respectively, in the morning and during the daytime activity than sleep span. Furthermore, different circadian patterns of blood pressure are found in arterial hypertension, in relation to different cardiovascular morbidity and mortality risk. Such temporal patterns result from circadian periodicity in pathophysiological mechanisms that give rise to predictable-in-time differences in susceptibility-resistance to cyclic environmental stressors that trigger these clinical events. Circadian rhythms also may affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cardiovascular and other medications. Knowledge of 24-h patterns in the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality plus circadian rhythm-dependencies of underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms suggests the requirement for preventive and therapeutic interventions is not the same throughout the day and night, and should be tailored accordingly to improve outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

These patterns are derived from heart rate data obtained while wearing an unobtrusive, two-lead heart rate monitor over a 24-hour period. To establish basic reliability, the second author blindly rated heart-monitored data from 50 subjects on two occasions, separated by an average of 6.6 weeks (range = 2.9-15.7 weeks). Subjects were classified as "definitely psychiatric," "probably psychiatric," "borderline," "broadly normal," and "signature normal." The exact category agreement rate was 78{\%}. If a one-category difference is permitted (e.g., "definitely psychiatric" and "probably psychiatric" counted as an agreement), the agreement rate was 92{\%}.

Three 10-second and 2 six-minute heart rate recordings were obtained during each of 2 visits, separated by 1 to 2 weeks. We partitioned the measurement error into components and computed intraclass correlation coefficients using nested, random effects models. Repeatability improved with the length of recording: intraclass correlation coefficients were greater than 0.7 for 6-minute measures and 2-minute time domain measures and greater than 0.5 for 2-minute frequency domain measures. Repeatability of measures from 10-second records was lower, but improved considerably when the mean from 2 or 3 records was used. Correlations between the same measures from different length recordings were quite high. Our findings support the use of records of at least 5 minutes in length in epidemiological studies, in accordance with previous guidelines. Researchers using 10-second records should consider taking the mean of several recordings, when possible, or using statistical methods to correct for measurement error.},

abstract = {The association of irregular sleep schedules with circadian timing and academic performance has not been systematically examined. We studied 61 undergraduates for 30 days using sleep diaries, and quantified sleep regularity using a novel metric, the sleep regularity index (SRI). In the most and least regular quintiles, circadian phase and light exposure were assessed using salivary dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) and wrist-worn photometry, respectively. DLMO occurred later (00:08 ± 1:54 vs. 21:32 ± 1:48; p {\textless} 0.003); the daily sleep propensity rhythm peaked later (06:33 ± 0:19 vs. 04:45 ± 0:11; p {\textless} 0.005); and light rhythms had lower amplitude (102 ± 19 lux vs. 179 ± 29 lux; p {\textless} 0.005) in Irregular compared to Regular sleepers. A mathematical model of the circadian pacemaker and its response to light was used to demonstrate that Irregular vs. Regular group differences in circadian timing were likely primarily due to their different patterns of light exposure. A positive correlation (r = 0.37; p {\textless} 0.004) between academic performance and SRI was observed. These findings show that irregular sleep and light exposure patterns in college students are associated with delayed circadian rhythms and lower academic performance. Moreover, the modeling results reveal that light-based interventions may be therapeutically effective in improving sleep regularity in this population.},

abstract = {Background A reduction of complexity of heart beating interval variability that is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality in cardiovascular disease states is thought to derive from the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic neural impulses to the heart. However, rhythmic clocklike behavior intrinsic to pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node (SAN) drives their beating, even in the absence of autonomic neural input. Objective To test how this rhythmic clocklike behavior intrinsic to pacemaker cells interacts with autonomic impulses to the heart beating interval variability in vivo. Methods We analyzed beating interval variability in time and frequency domains and by fractal and entropy analyses: (1) in vivo, when the brain input to the SAN is intact; (2) during autonomic denervation in vivo; (3) in isolated SAN tissue (ie, in which the autonomic neural input is completely absent); (4) in single pacemaker cells isolated from the SAN; and (5) after autonomic receptor stimulation of these cells. Results Spontaneous beating intervals of pacemaker cells residing in the isolated SAN tissue exhibit fractal-like behavior and have lower approximate entropy compared with those in the intact heart. Isolation of pacemaker cells from SAN tissue, however, leads to a loss in the beating interval order and fractal-like behavior. $\beta$-Adrenergic receptor stimulation of isolated pacemaker cells increases intrinsic clock synchronization, decreases their action potential period, and increases system complexity. Conclusions Both the average beating interval in vivo and beating interval complexity are conferred by the combined effects of clock periodicity intrinsic to pacemaker cells and their response to autonomic neural input. {\textcopyright} 2014 Heart Rhythm Society.},

abstract = {Diminished baroreflex sensitivity in the morning negatively influences morning coronary blood flow and blood pressure control in hypertensive patients. Our aim was to determine the contribution of the mechanical and neural components of the cardiac baroreflex to diurnal variation in blood pressure control. In 12 healthy participants, we used the modified Oxford method to quantify baroreflex sensitivity for rising (G(up)) and falling (G(down)) pressures in the morning (7:00 am) and afternoon (4:00 pm). Beat-to-beat blood pressure, R-R intervals, and carotid artery diameter measurements were recorded. Integrated sensitivity was determined by plotting R-R intervals against systolic blood pressure. The mechanical component was carotid artery diameter plotted against systolic blood pressure, and the neural component was R-R intervals plotted against carotid artery diameter. Linear mixed models were used to compare the integrated, mechanical, and neural sensitivities between morning and afternoon. We found significant diurnal variation in integrated sensitivity, with an attenuated response in the morning (G(up)=13.0±0.6; G(down)=6.3±0.4 ms/mm Hg) when compared with the afternoon (G(up)=15.1±0.6; G(down)=12.6±0.4 ms/mm Hg). For rising pressures, the diminished integrated sensitivity in the morning was caused by a reduction in mechanical sensitivity, whereas for falling pressures it was caused by a reduction in neural sensitivity. Our findings explicate the mechanisms underlying diurnal variation in baroreflex function. Pharmacological and lifestyle interventions targeted specifically at the diminished component of the cardiac baroreflex in the morning may lead to better management of hypertension.},

Schruers, Klaus Wiedemann, C{\"{u}}neyt Demiralay Abstract Background The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) and the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are considered to play the most crucial role in the pathophysiology of stress responsiveness and are increasingly studied together. However, only few studies have simultaneously assessed HPA axis and ANS activity to investigate their direct interaction in pathophysiology, while no study so far has assessed the dynamic interplay between the two systems in healthy subjects through endocrine challenges. Methods The present study assessed the direct effects of overnight pharmacoendocrine HPA axis challenges with dexamethasone (suppression) and metyrapone (stimulation) on ANS activity at rest as determined by linear and nonlinear measures of heart rate variability (HRV) in 39 young healthy individuals. Results Findings indicated significant effects of metyrapone, but not dexamethasone on autonomic activity at rest based on HRV measures. HRV after metyrapone was overall significantly reduced in comparison to baseline or post-dexamethasone conditions, while the combined metyrapone-related reduction of HRV measures RMSSD, NN50({\%}) and HF({\%}) with concomitant increase of the unifractal scaling coefficient $\alpha$fast value jointly indicated a specifically diminished vagal activity. Conclusions We provide first data that HPA axis stimulation (metyrapone) is associated with reduced vagal tone, while HPA axis suppression (dexamethasone) has no effect on autonomic modulation of heart function. Our results support a vital role of the parasympathetic nervous system in the interplay between ANS and HPA axis and, thus, in the modulation of stress-related cardiovascular responsiveness and the susceptibility to stress-related disorders.},

abstract = {Circadian Profile of Heart Rate Variability. INTRODUCTION: Although heart rate variability (HRV) has been established as a tool to study cardiac autonomic activity, almost no data are available on the circadian patterns of HRV in healthy subjects aged 20 to 70 years. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated 166 healthy volunteers (81 women and 85 men; age 42 +/- 15 years, range 20-70) without evidence of cardiac disease. Time-domain HRV parameters were determined from 24-hour Holter monitoring and calculated as hourly mean values and mean 24-hour values. All volunteers were fully mobile, awoke around 7 A.M., and had 6 to 8 hours of sleep. Circadian profiles of vagus-associated HRV parameters revealed a marked day-night pattern, with a peak at nighttime and a plateau at daytime. The characteristic nocturnal peak and the day-night amplitude diminished with aging by decade. Estimates of overall HRV (geometric triangular index [TI], SD of NN intervals [SDNN]) and long-term components of HRV (SD of the averages of NN intervals for all 5-min segments [SDANN]) were low at nighttime and increased in the morning hours. There was a significant decline of 24-hour values of all HRV parameters (P {\textless} 0.001) and a strong negative correlation (P {\textless} 0.001) with increasing age. Mean 24-hour RR interval (P {\textless} 0.001), SDNN, mean SD of NN intervals for all 5-minute intervals (SDNNi), and SDANN (all P {\textless} 0.01) were significantly higher in men. Younger men also exhibited significantly higher values for vagus-associated parameters (root mean square successive difference [rMSSD], P {\textless} 0.05; SDNNi, P {\textless} 0.01); however, gender differences diminished with increasing age. CONCLUSION: Normal aging is associated with a constant decline of cardiac vagal modulation due to a significant decrease of nocturnal parasympathetic activity. The significant gender-related difference of HRV decreases with aging. These findings emphasize the need to determine age-, gender-, and nycthemeral-dependent normal ranges for HRV assessment.},

abstract = {The amount of time between heartbeats is controlled by the rate of depolarization of the sinoatrial node. This rate is controlled by a combination of sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs. For this reason, analysis of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) derived from intervals between normal heart beats provides insights into changing cardiac autonomic function. Increased sympathetic control of the heart from one time point to the next tends to increase HRs, decrease the amount of vagally modulated sinus arrhythmia measured as high-frequency (HF) spectral power, and increase the ratio between low-frequency (LF) spectral power and HF (the LF/HF ratio). Conversely, a shift toward greater vagal control of the heart tends to produce decreased HRs, increases in HF power, and decreases the LF/HF ratio. Clear circadian cycles of HR and HRV are seen in most subjects and correspond to periods of sleep and activity. The magnitude of these cycles is well captured by traditional HRV indices such as deviation of all normal-to-normal (NN) intervals. Cosinor analysis also provides a rough estimate of the magnitude of circadian rhythms. We have observed that HR and HRV fluctuate over time in a cyclic manner in most subjects. Although these cycles are especially prominent during the nighttime, they are seen in the daytime as well. We have developed a number of measures that quantify ultradian properties of HR/HRV cycles and would permit comparisons between subjects. We applied these measures during overnight polysomnography and have shown that ultradian rhythms of cardiac autonomic modulation have a variable and often weak correspondence with traditional sleep stages . In the current study, we applied the methodology developed for the nighttime recordings to 24-h recordings in young healthy subjects and compared these results to those obtained during the nighttime only in the same subjects and in an older group of cardiac patients. Our purpose was to explore the presenc- e and magnitude of ultradian cycles of HRV during the entire 24-h period and during sleep.},

abstract = {Background: Diurnal variation of natriuretic peptide (NP) levels and its relationship with 24-h blood pressure (BP) rhythm has not been established. Obese individuals have a relative NP deficiency and disturbed BP rhythmicity. Objectives: This clinical trial evaluated the diurnal rhythmicity of NPs (B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP], mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide [MR-proANP], N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP]) and the relationship of NP rhythm with 24-h BP rhythm in healthy lean and obese individuals. Methods: On the background of a standardized diet, healthy, normotensive, lean (body mass index 18.5 to 25 kg/m2) and obese (body mass index 30 to 45 kg/m2) individuals, age 18 to 40 years, underwent 24-h inpatient protocol involving ambulatory BP monitoring starting 24 h prior to the visit, controlled light intensity, and repeated blood draws for assessment of analytes. Cosinor analysis of normalized NP levels (normalized to 24-h mean value) was conducted to assess the diurnal NP rhythm and its relationship with systolic BP. Results: Among 52 participants screened, 40 participants (18 lean, 22 obese; 50{\%} women; 65{\%} Black) completed the study. The median range spread (percentage difference between the minimum and maximum values) over 24 h for MR-proANP, BNP, and NT-proBNP levels was 72.0{\%} (interquartile range [IQR]: 50.9{\%} to 119.6{\%}), 75.5{\%} (IQR: 50.7{\%} to 106.8{\%}), and 135.0{\%} (IQR: 66.3{\%} to 270.4{\%}), respectively. A cosine wave-shaped 24-h oscillation of normalized NP levels (BNP, MR-proANP, and NT-proBNP) was noted both in lean and obese individuals (prhythmicity {\textless}0.05 for all). A larger phase difference between MR-proANP BP rhythm (−4.9 h vs. −0.7 h) and BNP BP rhythm (−3.3 h vs. −0.9 h) was seen in obese compared with lean individuals. Conclusions: This human physiological trial elucidates evidence of diurnal NP rhythmicity and the presence of an NP-BP rhythm axis. There exists a misalignment of the NP-BP diurnal rhythm in the obese, which may contribute to the disturbed diurnal BP pattern observed among obese individuals.

abstract = {Most variables of clinical interest show predictable changes with different frequencies, mainly, but not exclusively, along the rest-activity cycle (circadian variation). Methods of linear least-squares estimation have been designed for the detection of periodic components in sparse and noisy time series (as they are usually present in clinical situations). They include the single and population-mean cosinor methods. In cases where more than one period is statistically significant over the span of time investigated, or when the waveform is non-sinusoidal, the use of multiple components analysis to fit a model consisting of several cosine functions (harmonics or not from a given fundamental period) is recommended. We describe these methods, from the characterization of the underlying models to the process of parameter estimation. As an application example, we describe the modelling of the circadian variation of blood pressure (BP). In most individuals, BP presents a morning increase, a small postprandial valley and a deeper descent during nocturnal rest. This pattern can be easily modelled by means of a model with periods of 24 and 12 hours. Individuals that differ from this model might be considered to present increased cardiovascular risk. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and a change in the 24 h pattern of adverse cardiovascular events and mortality. Adverse cardiovascular events occur more frequently in the middle of the night in people with OSA, earlier than the morning prevalence of these events in the general population. It is unknown if these changes are associated with a change in the underlying circadian rhythms, independent of behaviors such as sleep, physical activity, and meal intake. In this exploratory analysis, we studied the endogenous circadian rhythms of blood pressure, heart rate, melatonin and cortisol in 11 participants (48 ± 4 years; seven with OSA) throughout a 5 day study that was originally designed to examine circadian characteristics of obstructive apnea events. After a baseline night, participants completed 10 recurring 5 h 20 min behavioral cycles divided evenly into standardized sleep and wake periods. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded in a relaxed semirecumbent posture 15 minutes after each scheduled wake time. Salivary melatonin and cortisol concentrations were measured at 1–1.5 h intervals during wakefulness. Mixed-model cosinor analyses were performed to determine the rhythmicity of all variables with respect to external time and separately to circadian phases (aligned to the dim light melatonin onset, DLMO). The circadian rhythm of blood pressure peaked much later in OSA compared to control participants (group × circadian phase, p {\textless} .05); there was also a trend toward a slightly delayed cortisol rhythm in the OSA group. Rhythms of heart rate and melatonin did not differ between the groups. In this exploratory analysis, OSA appears to be associated with a phase change (relative to DLMO) in the endogenous circadian rhythm of blood pressure during relaxed wakefulness, independent of common daily behaviors.},

abstract = {Blood pressure (BP) fluctuates throughout the day. The pattern it follows represents one of the most important circadian rhythms in the human body. For example, morning BP surge has been suggested as a potential risk factor for cardio-vascular events occurring in the morning, but the accurate quantification of this phenomenon remains a challenge. Here, we outline a novel method to quantify morning surge. We demonstrate how the most commonly used method to model 24-hour BP, the single cosinor approach, can be extended to a multiple-component cosinor random-effects model. We outline how this model can be used to obtain a measure of morning BP surge by obtaining derivatives of the model fit. The model is compared with a functional principal component analysis that determines the main components of variability in the data. Data from the Mitchelstown Study, a population-based study of Irish adults (n = 2047), were used where a subsample (1207) underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. We demonstrate that our 2-component model provided a significant improvement in fit compared with a single model and a similar fit to a more complex model captured by b-splines using functional principal component analysis. The estimate of the average maximum slope was 2.857 mmHg/30 min (bootstrap estimates; 95{\%} CI: 2.855-2.858 mmHg/30 min). Simulation results allowed us to quantify the between-individual SD in maximum slopes, which was 1.02 mmHg/30 min. By obtaining derivatives we have demonstrated a novel approach to quantify morning BP surge and its variation between individuals. This is the first demonstration of cosinor approach to obtain a measure of morning surge.},

abstract = {Diurnal rhythms influence cardiovascular physiology, i.e. heart rate and blood pressure, and they appear to also modulate the incidence of serious adverse cardiac events. Diurnal variations occur also at the molecular level including changes in gene expression in the heart and blood vessels. Moreover, the risk/benefit ratio of some therapeutic strategies and the concentration of circulating cardiovascular system biomarkers may also vary across the 24-hr light/dark cycle. Synchrony between external and internal diurnal rhythms and harmony among molecular rhythms within the cell are essential for normal organ biology. Diurnal variations in the responsiveness of the cardiovascular system to environmental stimuli are mediated by a complex interplay between extracellular (i.e. neurohumoral factors) and intracellular (i.e. specific genes that are differentially light/dark regulated) mechanisms. Neurohormones, which are particularly relevant to the cardiovascular system, such as melatonin, exhibit a diurnal variation and may play a role in the synchronization of molecular circadian clocks in the peripheral tissue and the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Moreover, mounting evidence reveals that the blood melatonin rhythm has a crucial role in several cardiovascular functions, including daily variations in blood pressure. Melatonin has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, chronobiotic and, possibly, epigenetic regulatory functions. This article reviews current knowledge related to the biological role of melatonin and its circadian rhythm in cardiovascular disease.},

abstract = {Most variables of interest in laboratory medicine show predictable changes with several frequencies in the span of time investigated. The wave- form of such nonsinusoidal rhythms can be well described by the use of multiple components rhythmometry, a method that allows fitting a linear model with several cosine functions. The method, originally described for analysis of longitudinal time series, is here extended to allow analysis of hybrid data (time series sampled from a group of subjects, each represented by an individual series). Given k individual series, we can fit the same linear model with m different frequencies (harmonics or not from one fundamental period) to each series. This fit will provide estimations for 2m + 1 parameters, namely, the amplitude and acrophase of each component, as well as the rhythm-adjusted mean. Assuming that the set of parameters obtained for each individual is a random sample from a multivariate normal population, the corresponding population parameter estimates can be based on the means of estimates obtained from individuals in the sample. Their confidence intervals depend on the variability among individual parameter estimates. The variance- covariance matrix can then be estimated on the basis of the sample covariances. Confidence intervals for the rhythm-adjusted mean, as well as for the amplitude-acrophase pair, of each component can then be computed using the estimated covariance matrix. The p-values for testing the zero- amplitude assumption for each component, as well as for the global model, can finally be derived using those confidence intervals and the t and F distributions. The method, validated by a simulation study and illustrated by an example of modeling the circadian variation of heart rate, represents a new step in the development of statistical procedures in chronobiology.},

abstract = {There exists a robust day/night pattern in the incidence of adverse cardiac events with a peak at approximately 10 a.m. This peak traditionally has been attributed to day/night patterns in behaviors affecting cardiac function in vulnerable individuals. However, influences from the endogenous circadian pacemaker independent from behaviors may also affect cardiac control. Heartbeat dynamics under healthy conditions exhibit robust complex fluctuations characterized by self-similar temporal structures, which break down under pathologic conditions. We hypothesize that these dynamical features of the healthy human heartbeat have an endogenous circadian rhythm that brings the features closer to those observed under pathologic conditions at the endogenous circadian phase corresponding to approximately 10 a.m. We investigate heartbeat dynamics in healthy subjects recorded throughout a 10-day protocol wherein the sleep/wake and behavior cycles are desynchronized from the endogenous circadian cycle, enabling assessment of circadian factors while controlling for behavior-related factors. We demonstrate that the scaling exponent characterizing temporal correlations in heartbeat dynamics does exhibit a significant circadian rhythm (with a sharp peak at the circadian phase corresponding to approximately 10 a.m.), which is independent from scheduled behaviors and mean heart rate. Cardiac dynamics under pathologic conditions such as congestive heart failure also are associated with a larger value of the scaling exponent of the interbeat interval. Thus, the sharp peak in the scaling exponent at the circadian phase coinciding with the period of highest cardiac vulnerability observed in epidemiological studies suggests that endogenous circadian-mediated influences on cardiac control may be involved in the day/night pattern of adverse cardiac events in vulnerable individuals.},

abstract = {Suicide is the second leading cause of death, worldwide, for those between the ages of 24 and 44 y old. In 2013, more than 41,000 suicides occurred in the United States. These statistics underscore the need to 1) understand why people die by suicide and 2) identify risk factors that are potentially modifiable. While it has been posited that sleep disturbance may represent one such factor, systematic research in this arena did not begin until the 2000s. Since that time, sleep disturbance has been reliably identified as a risk factor for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. While insomnia, nightmares, and other sleep disorders have each been found to contribute to the risk for suicidal ideation and behavior, it is also possible that these factors share some common variance. One possibility is that sleep disturbance results in being awake at night, and being awake at night also confers risk. The hypothesis proffered here is that being awake when one is not biologically prepared to be so results in "hypofrontality" and diminished executive function, and that this represents a common pathway to suicidal ideation and behavior. Such a proposition is highly testable under a variety of possible protocols. The current review summarizes the extant literature on suicide rates by time-of-day, and discusses circadian, psychosocial, and neurocognitive explanations of risk. Such a focus promises to enhance our understanding of how sleep disturbance may confer risk, allows for the identification of future lines of research, and further justifies the need for interventions that promote good sleep continuity among at-risk individuals.},

abstract = {Sleep is a crucial biological process that is regulated through complex interactions between multiple brain regions and neuromodulators. As sleep disorders can have deleterious impacts on health and quality of life, a wide variety of pharmacotherapies have been developed to treat conditions of excessive wakefulness and excessive sleepiness. The neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE), through its involvement in the ascending arousal system, impacts the efficacy of many wake- and sleep-promoting medications. Wake-promoting drugs such as amphetamine and modafinil increase extracellular levels of NE, enhancing transmission along the wake-promoting pathway. GABAergic sleep-promoting medications like benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like drugs that act more specifically on benzodiazepine receptors increase the activity of GABA, which inhibits NE transmission and the wake-promoting pathway. Melatonin and related compounds increase sleep by suppressing the activity of the neurons in the brain's circadian clock, and NE influences the synthesis of melatonin. Antihistamines block the wake-promoting effects of histamine, which shares reciprocal signaling with NE. Many antidepressants that affect the signaling of NE are also used for treatment of insomnia. Finally, adrenergic receptor antagonists that are used to treat cardiovascular disorders have considerable sedative effects. Therefore, NE, long known for its role in maintaining general arousal, is also a crucial player in sleep pharmacology. The purpose of this review is to consider the role of NE in the actions of wake- and sleep-promoting drugs within the framework of the brain arousal systems. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Introduction: About one-half of sudden cardiac deaths occur in those without known CAD suggesting the need for better risk-stratification tests. Autonomic dysfunction, measured by low heart rate variability (HRV), can occur with myocardial ischemia. Testing for low HRV may help to identify high-risk, asymptomatic individuals. The association of low HRV with ischemia may also be greatest during the morning hours, when cardiac events (MI, sudden death) are most likely to be triggered. Hypothesis: In a cohort of veteran males with no known CAD, subclinical myocardial ischemia is associated with autonomic dysfunction as measured by low HRV; this association is greatest during morning hours. Methods: We evaluated 24-hour ambulatory ECGs in middle-aged twins without known CAD from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, and calculated frequency domain and non-linear (Dyx) HRV metrics. All subjects underwent [13N]-ammonia positron emission tomography with adenosine stress, with ischemia defined as greater than 5{\%} perfusion deficit. Mixed models were used to compare HRV between ischemic and non-ischemic subjects in 1-hour intervals, and morning hours were 6 AM until 10 AM. Results: Data on 276 twin subjects were analyzed; the mean age (SD) was 53 (3) and 55 (20{\%}) had ischemia. HRV was significantly different between ischemic and non-ischemic twins during morning hours (figure 1), with the largest magnitude difference occurring with Dyx at 7 AM. Each SD decrease in Dyx associated with an OR for ischemia of 4.8 (95{\%} CI, 1.5 — 15.8). Dyx in morning hours remained significant in a subgroup of pairs discordant for ischemia and after risk factor adjustment. Significant differences by ischemia status were noted for low-frequency and very-low-frequency HRV. Conclusions: Lower HRV is strongly associated with subclinical myocardial ischemia primarily during morning hours. More research regarding this circadian autonomic vulnerability and its clinical implications are warranted.},

Patients underwent ambulatory ST segment monitoring off all routine antianginal treatment (total 6264 hours) and exercise testing (n = 146). Ninety one patients (61{\%}) had a total of 598 episodes of significant ST segment change, of which 446 (75{\%}) were asymptomatic. Twenty seven patients (18{\%}) had only painless episodes; 14 (9{\%}) patients only painful episodes; 50 patients (33{\%}) had both painless and painful episodes. The mean number of ST segment changes per day was 2.58 (1.95 silent); however, 11 patients (7{\%}) had 50{\%} of all silent episodes, and 48 patients (32{\%}) had 91{\%} of all silent episodes. Fifty nine patients (39{\%}) had no ST segment changes on ambulatory monitoring, and 73 patients (49{\%}) had no evidence of silent ischaemia. Episodes ofsilent ischaemia occurred with a similar circadian distribution to that of painful ischaemia, predominantly between 0730 and 1930. There was a similar mean rise in heart rate at the onset of both silent and painful episodes ofischaemia. Silent ischaemia was significantly more frequent in patients with three vessel disease than in those with single vessel disease, and was also significantly related to both time to 1 mm ST depression and maximal exercise duration on exercise testing. There was a highly significant relation between the mean number and duration of episodes of silent ischaemia in patients with positive exercise tests when compared with those with negative tests. No episode of ventricular tachycardia was recorded in association with silent ischaemic change.},

abstract = {Importance: Short sleep has been associated with obesity, but to date the association between exposure to artificial light at night (ALAN) while sleeping and obesity is unknown. Objective: To determine whether ALAN exposure while sleeping is associated with the prevalence and risk of obesity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This baseline and prospective analysis included women aged 35 to 74 years enrolled in the Sister Study in all 50 US states and Puerto Rico from July 2003 through March 2009. Follow-up was completed on August 14, 2015. A total of 43722 women with no history of cancer or cardiovascular disease who were not shift workers, daytime sleepers, or pregnant at baseline were included in the analysis. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2017, through December 31, 2018. Exposures: Artificial light at night while sleeping reported at enrollment, categorized as no light, small nightlight in the room, light outside the room, and light or television in the room. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalent obesity at baseline was based on measured general obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥30.0) and central obesity (waist circumference [WC] ≥88 cm, waist-to-hip ratio [WHR] ≥0.85, or waist-to-height ratio [WHtR]≥0.5). To evaluate incident overweight and obesity, self-reported BMI at enrollment was compared with self-reported BMI at follow-up (mean [SD] follow-up, 5.7 [1.0] years). Generalized log-linear models with robust error variance were used to estimate multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) and relative risks (RRs) with 95{\%} CIs for prevalent and incident obesity. Results: Among the population of 43 722 women (mean [SD] age, 55.4 [8.9] years), having any ALAN exposure while sleeping was positively associated with a higher prevalence of obesity at baseline, as measured using BMI (PR, 1.03; 95{\%} CI, 1.02-1.03), WC (PR, 1.12; 95{\%} CI, 1.09-1.16), WHR (PR, 1.04; 95{\%} CI, 1.00-1.08), and WHtR (PR, 1.07; 95{\%} CI, 1.04-1.09), after adjusting for confounding factors, with P {\textless}.001 for trend for each measure. Having any ALAN exposure while sleeping was also associated with incident obesity (RR, 1.19; 95{\%} CI, 1.06-1.34). Compared with no ALAN, sleeping with a television or a light on in the room was associated with gaining 5 kg or more (RR, 1.17; 95{\%} CI, 1.08-1.27; P {\textless}.001 for trend), a BMI increase of 10{\%} or more (RR, 1.13; 95{\%} CI, 1.02-1.26; P =.04 for trend), incident overweight (RR, 1.22; 95{\%} CI,1.06-1.40; P =.03 for trend), and incident obesity (RR, 1.33; 95{\%} CI, 1.13-1.57; P {\textless}.001 for trend). Results were supported by sensitivity analyses and additional multivariable analyses including potential mediators such as sleep duration and quality, diet, and physical activity. Conclusions and Relevance: These results suggest that exposure to ALAN while sleeping may be a risk factor for weight gain and development of overweight or obesity. Further prospective and interventional studies could help elucidate this association and clarify whether lowering exposure to ALAN while sleeping can promote obesity prevention.},

abstract = {Autonomic function during sleep and wakefulness has been extensively investigated, however information concerning autonomic changes during the wake to sleep transition is scarce. The objective of the present study was to non-invasively characterize autonomic function and additional physiologic changes during sleep onset in normal and abnormal sleep. The estimation of autonomic function was based on time-frequency analysis of the RR interval series, using the power components in the very-low-frequency range (0.005-0.04 Hz), low-frequency (0.04-0.15 Hz), and high-frequency range (0.15-0.5 Hz). The ratio of low to high frequency power represented the sympathovagal balance. Thirty-four subjects who underwent whole night polysomnography were divided into 3 groups according to their complaints and study results: normal subjects, apneic patients (OSAS), and subjects with various sleep disorders (VSD). The results indicated a significant increase in RR interval during sleep onset, although its variability decreased; respiratory rate did not change, yet respiration became more stable; EMG amplitude and its variability decreased with sleep onset. Very-low-frequency power started to decrease significantly 2 min before sleep onset in all groups; low-frequency power decreased and high-frequency power did not change significantly in all groups, accordingly their ratio decreased and reflected a shift towards parasympathetic predominance. Although autonomic function displayed similar behavior in all subjects, OSAS and VSD patients presented a higher sympathovagal balance reflecting enhanced sympathetic predominance in those groups compared to normal subjects, both before and after sleep onset. All parameters reached a nadir at a defined time point during the process of falling asleep. We conclude that the wake-sleep transition period represents a transitional process between two physiologically different states; this transition starts with a decrease in the very slow oscillations in heart rate that anticipates a step-change resetting of autonomic function, followed by a decrease in sympathovagal balance towards the end of the process. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Profound disturbances in sleep architecture occur in major depressive disorders (MDD) and in bipolar affective disorders. Reduction in slow wave sleep, decreased latency of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and abnormalities in the timing of REM/non-REM sleep cycles have all been documented in patients with MDD. It is thus evident that an understanding of the basic mechanisms of sleep regulation is essential for an analysis of the pathophysiology of depressive disorders. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which functions as the body's master circadian clock, plays a major role in the regulation of the sleep/wakefulness rhythm and interacts actively with the homeostatic processes that regulate sleep. The control of melatonin secretion by the SCN, the occurrence of high concentrations of melatonin receptors in the SCN, and the suppression of electrical activity in the SCN by melatonin all underscore the major influence which this neurohormone has in regulating the sleep/wake cycle. The transition from wakefulness to high sleep propensity is associated with the nocturnal rise of endogenous melatonin secretion. Various lines of evidence show that depressed patients exhibit disturbances in both the amplitude and shape of the melatonin secretion rhythm and that melatonin can improve the quality of sleep in these patients. The choice of a suitable antidepressant that improves sleep quality is thus important while treating a depressive disorder. The novel antidepressant agomelatine, which combines the properties of a 5-HT2C antagonist and a melatonergic MT1/MT2 receptor agonist, has been found very effective for resetting the disturbed sleep/wake cycle and in improving the clinical status of MDD. Agomelatine has also been found useful in treating sleep problems and improving the clinical status of patients suffering from seasonal affective disorder. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
