abstract = {Objectives This study was devised to describe the different cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) appearances in light chain amyloid (AL) and transthyretin-related amyloidosis (ATTR). Background CMR is increasingly used to investigate patients with suspected amyloidosis. Global subendocardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) has been reported as typical of AL amyloidosis, whereas different patterns have been noted in ATTR amyloidosis. Methods We performed de novo analyses on original DICOM magnetic resonance imaging in 46 patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis and 51 patients with ATTR type who had been referred to a specialist amyloidosis center between 2007 and 2012 after CMR. Histological examination was performed in all cases, with immunohistochemistry, to confirm systemic amyloidosis. Results Patients' median age was 68 Â± 10 years, and 74% were male. Left ventricular mass was markedly increased in ATTR amyloidosis (228 g [202 to 267 g]) compared with AL type (167 g [137 to 191 g]) (p < 0.001). LGE was detected in all but 1 cardiac amyloidosis patient (AL type) and was substantially more extensive in ATTR compared with AL amyloidosis. Ninety percent of ATTR patients demonstrated transmural LGE compared with 37% of AL patients (p < 0.001). Right ventricular LGE was apparent in all ATTR patients but in only 33 AL patients (72%) (p < 0.001). Despite these findings, survival was significantly better in cardiac ATTR amyloidosis compared with AL type. We derived an LGE scoring system (Query Amyloid Late Enhancement) that independently differentiated ATTR from AL amyloidosis and, when incorporated into a logistic regression model with age and wall thickness, detected ATTR type with 87% sensitivity and 96% specificity. Conclusions Transmural patterns of LGE distinguished ATTR from AL cardiac amyloidosis with high accuracy in this real-world analysis of CMR. Precise diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis is crucial given the role of chemotherapy in AL type and with novel therapies for ATTR type currently in development.},

abstract = {Electrical storm is an increasingly common and life-threatening syndrome that is defined by 3 or more sustained episodes of ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or appropriate shocks from an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator within 24 hours. The clinical presentation can be dramatic. Electrical storm can manifest itself during acute myocardial infarction and in patients who have structural heart disease, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or an inherited arrhythmic syndrome. The presence or absence of structural heart disease and the electrocardiographic morphology of the presenting arrhythmia can provide important diagnostic clues into the mechanism of electrical storm. Electrical storm typically has a poor outcome.The effective management of electrical storm requires an understanding of arrhythmia mechanisms, therapeutic options, device programming, and indications for radiofrequency catheter ablation. Initial management involves determining and correcting the underlying ischemia, electrolyte imbalances, or other causative factors. Amiodarone and $\beta$-blockers, especially propranolol, effectively resolve arrhythmias in most patients. Nonpharmacologic treatment, including radiofrequency ablation, can control electrical storm in drug-refractory patients. Patients who have implantable cardioverter-defibrillators can present with multiple shocks and may require drug therapy and device reprogramming. After the acute phase of electrical storm, the treatment focus should shift toward maximizing heart-failure therapy, performing revascularization, and preventing subsequent ventricular arrhythmias. Herein, we present an organized approach for effectively evaluating and managing electrical storm.},

abstract = {Importance: About 10% of patients with acute chest pain are ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Early, accurate estimation of the probability of ACS in these patients using the clinical examination could prevent many hospital admissions among low-risk patients and ensure that high-risk patients are promptly treated. Objective: To review systematically the accuracy of the initial history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and risk scores incorporating these elements with the first cardiac-specific troponin. Study Selection Medline and Emcase: were searched (January 1, 1995-July 31, 2015), along with reference lists from retrieved articles, to identify prospective studies of diagnostic test accuracy among patients admitted to the emergency department with symptoms suggesting ACS. Data Extraction and Synthesis: We identified 2992 unique articles; 58 met inclusion criteria. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio (LR) of findings for the diagnosis of ACS. The reference standard for ACS was either a final hospital diagnosis of ACS or occurrence of a cardiovascular event within 6 weeks. Results: The clinical findings and risk factors most suggestive of ACS were prior abnormal stress test (specificity, 96%; LR, 3.1 [95%CI, 2.0-4.7]), peripheral arterial disease (specificity, 97%; LR, 2.7 [95%CI, 1.5-4.8]), and pain radiation to both arms (specificity, 96%; LR, 2.6 [95%CI, 1.8-3.7]). The most useful electrocardiogram findings were ST-segment depression (specificity, 95%; LR, 5.3 [95%CI, 2.1-8.6]) and any evidence of ischemia (specificity, 91%; LR, 3.6 [95%CI,1.6-5.7]). Both the History, Electrocardiogram, Age, Risk Factors, Troponin (HEART) and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk scores performed well in diagnosing ACS: LR, 13 (95%CI, 7.0-24) for the high-risk range of the HEART score (7-10) and LR, 6.8 (95%CI, 5.2-8.9) for the high-risk range of the TIMI score (5-7). The most useful for identifying patients less likely to have ACS were the low-risk range HEART score (0-3) (LR, 0.20 [95%CI, 0.13-0.30]), low-risk range TIMI score (0-1) (LR, 0.31 [95%CI, 0.23-0.43]), or low to intermediate risk designation by the Heart Foundation of Australia and Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand risk algorithm (LR, 0.24 [95%CI, 0.19-0.31]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with suspected ACS presenting to emergency departments, the initial history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram alone did not confirm or exclude the diagnosis of ACS. Instead, the HEART or TIMI risk scores, which incorporate the first cardiac troponin, provided more diagnostic information. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

abstract = {IMPORTANCE Fluid overload occurring as a consequence of overly aggressive fluid resuscitation may adversely affect outcome in hemodynamically unstable critically ill patients. Therefore, following the initial fluid resuscitation, it is important to identify which patients will benefit from further fluid administration. OBJECTIVE To identify predictors of fluid responsiveness in hemodynamically unstable patients with signs of inadequate organ perfusion. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION Search of MEDLINE and EMBASE (1966 to June 2016) and reference lists from retrieved articles, previous reviews, and physical examination textbooks for studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of tests to predict fluid responsiveness in hemodynamically unstable adult patients who were defined as having refractory hypotension, signs of organ hypoperfusion, or both. Fluid responsiveness was defined as an increase in cardiac output following intravenous fluid administration. DATA EXTRACTION Two authors independently abstracted data (sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios [LRs]) and assessed methodological quality. A bivariate mixed-effects binary regression model was used to pool the sensitivities, specificities, and LRs across studies. RESULTS A total of 50 studies (N = 2260 patients) were analyzed. In all studies, indices were measured before assessment of fluid responsiveness. The mean prevalence of fluid responsiveness was 50% (95% CI, 42%-56%). Findings on physical examination were not predictive of fluid responsiveness with LRs and 95% CIs for each finding crossing 1.0. A low central venous pressure (CVP) (mean threshold <8 mm Hg) was associated with fluid responsiveness (positive LR, 2.6 [95% CI, 1.4-4.6]; pooled specificity, 76%), but a CVP greater than the threshold made fluid responsiveness less likely (negative LR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.39-0.65]; pooled sensitivity, 62%). Respiratory variation in vena cava diameter measured by ultrasound (distensibility index >15%) predicted fluid responsiveness in a subgroup of patients without spontaneous respiratory efforts (positive LR, 5.3 [95% CI, 1.1-27]; pooled specificity, 85%). Patients with less vena cava distensibility were not as likely to be fluid responsive (negative LR, 0.27 [95% CI, 0.08-0.87]; pooled sensitivity, 77%). Augmentation of cardiac output or related parameters following passive leg raising predicted fluid responsiveness (positive LR, 11 [95% CI, 7.6-17]; pooled specificity, 92%). Conversely, the lack of an increase in cardiac output with passive leg raising identified patients unlikely to be fluid responsive (negative LR, 0.13 [95% CI, 0.07-0.22]; pooled sensitivity, 88%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Passive leg raising followed by measurement of cardiac output or related parameters may be the most useful test for predicting fluid responsiveness in hemodynamically unstable adults. The usefulness of respiratory variation in the vena cava requires confirmatory studies.},

abstract = {Background Current electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria for the diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) have low sensitivity. Objectives The goal of this study was to test a new method to improve the diagnostic performance of the electrocardiogram. Methods The study was divided into 2 groups, a test and a validation cohort. In the test cohort, 94 patients were analyzed, including 47 with the diagnosis of hypertensive crisis and 47 with normal blood pressure at admission. Echocardiography was used to estimate the left ventricular mass index. Area under the curve (AUC) analysis was used for comparison of single and combined leads. The McNemar test was used to assess agreement among the ECG criteria against the left ventricular mass index. The proposed ECG criteria involved measuring the amplitude of the deepest SÂ wave (SD) in any single lead and adding it to the S wave amplitude of lead V4(SV4). Currently accepted LVH ECG criteria such as Cornell voltage and Sokolow-Lyon were used for comparison. The validation cohort consisted of 122 consecutive patients referred for an echocardiogram regardless of the admitting diagnosis. Results The SDwas the most accurate single lead measurement for the diagnosis of LVH (AUC: 0.80; pÂ < 0.001). When both cohorts were analyzed, the SDÂ + SV4criteria outperformed Cornell voltage with a significantly higher sensitivity (62% [95% confidence interval [CI]: 50% to 72%] vs. 35% [95% CI: 24% to 46%]). The specificities of all theÂ criteria wereÂ â¥90%, with no significant difference among them. Conclusions The proposed criteria for the ECG diagnosis of LVH improved the sensitivity and overall accuracy of the test.},

They are therefore increasingly presenting as adults for medical care to non-specialist centres. A simple classification of adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) according to complexity can help clinicians to understand the implications of the cardiac anomaly presented. Issues specific to the conduct of anaesthesia in ACHD patients include the need to maintain euvolaemia, sinus rhythm and cardiac output, and in complex situations to balance the flow between the pulmonary and systemic circulations. It should be recognized that patients with pulmonary hypertension or Eisenmenger's syndrome are at extremely high risk of death in the perioperative period, and in all but life-threatening situations they should be cared for in specialist centres. Furthermore, an understanding of the need for antibiotic and thromboprophylaxis in specific groups is essential, as are strategies to control bleeding.},

abstract = {Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a physiological state in which inadequate tissue perfusion results from cardiac dysfunction, most commonly following acute myocardial infarction. Non-ischaemic causes include myocarditis, end-stage cardiomyopathy or sustained arrhythmias.

The use of reperfusion therapy has substantially reduced 30-day mortality in acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients.w1âw3 Currently, the optimal reperfusion therapy is timely primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The improvement in clinical outcome has been mostly observed in STEMI patients without cardiogenic shock. Despite reperfusion therapy, approximately 6â10% of STEMI patients develop cardiogenic shock during initial hospitalisation.1 ,2 w4 The large multicentre Should we Emergently Revascularise Occluded Coronaries for Cardiogenic Shock? (SHOCK) trial and registry demonstrated that early revascularisation, including PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting, in cardiogenic shock patients improves clinical outcome, but the overall 6-month mortality of cardiogenic shock patients remained 50%3 in accordance with other reports.1 w4 Despite reperfusion by primary PCI, cardiogenic shock remains the leading cause of death for hospitalised STEMI patients.1 w5

Cardiogenic shock after STEMI is mostly a consequence of decreased myocardial contractility due to the infarction, resulting in a cascade of decreased cardiac output, hypotension and decreased coronary blood flow (CBF), which will further reduce contractility and cardiac output. This vicious circle may not only lead to further myocardial ischaemia, but also to diminished organ perfusion and may ultimately result in multiple organ failure and death. Additional aggravation of the downward spiral is caused by a systemic inflammatory response and excess nitric oxide synthesis induced by the myocardial infarction, which further induces vasodilatation.2

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We determined whether estimated hemodynamics from history and physical examination (H&P) reflect invasive measurements and predict outcomes in advanced heart failure (HF). The role of the H&P in medical decision making has declined in favor of diagnostic tests, perhaps due to lack of evidence for utility.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We compared H&P estimates of filling pressures and cardiac index with invasive measurements in 194 patients in the ESCAPE trial. H&P estimates were compared with 6-month outcomes in 388 patients enrolled in ESCAPE. Measured right atrial pressure (RAP) was <8 mm Hg in 82% of patients with RAP estimated from jugular veins as <8 mm Hg, and was >12 mm Hg in 70% of patients when estimated as >12 mm Hg. From the H&P, only estimated RAP > or =12 mm Hg (odds ratio [OR] 4.6; P<0.001) and orthopnea > or =2 pillows (OR 3.6; P<0.05) were associated with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) > or =30 mm Hg. Estimated cardiac index did not reliably reflect measured cardiac index (P=0.09), but "cold" versus "warm" profile was associated with lower median measured cardiac index (1.75 vs. 2.0 L/min/m(2); P=0.004). In Cox regression analysis, discharge "cold" or "wet" profile conveyed a 50% increased risk of death or rehospitalization.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In advanced HF, the presence of orthopnea and elevated jugular venous pressure are useful to detect elevated PCWP, and a global assessment of inadequate perfusion ("cold" profile) is useful to detect reduced cardiac index. Hemodynamic profiles estimated from the discharge H&P identify patients at increased risk of early events.},

abstract = {Objectives This study tested the diagnostic and prognostic utility of a rapid, visual T1 assessment method for identification of cardiac amyloidosis (CA) in a "real-life" referral population undergoing cardiac magnetic resonance for suspected CA. Background In patients with confirmed CA, delayed-enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance (DE-CMR) frequently shows a diffuse, global hyperenhancement (HE) pattern. However, imaging is often technically challenging, and the prognostic significance of diffuse HE is unclear. Methods Ninety consecutive patients referred for suspected CA and 64 hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) were prospectively enrolled and underwent a modified DE-CMR protocol. After gadolinium administration a method for rapid, visual T1 assessment was used to identify the presence of diffuse HE during the scan, allowing immediate optimization of settings for the conventional DE-CMR that followed. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Results Among patients with suspected CA, 66% (59 of 90) demonstrated HE, with 81% (48 of 59) of these meeting pre-specified visual T1 assessment criteria for diffuse HE. Among hypertensive LVH patients, 6% (4 of 64) had HE, with none having diffuse HE. During 29 months of follow-up (interquartile range: 12 to 44 months), there were 50 (56%) deaths in patients with suspected CA and 4 (6%) in patients with hypertensive LVH. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that the presence of diffuse HE was the most important predictor of death in the group with suspected CA (hazard ratio: 5.5, 95% confidence interval: 2.7 to 11.0; p < 0.0001) and in the population as a whole (hazard ratio: 6.0, 95% confidence interval 3.0 to 12.1; p < 0.0001). Among 25 patients with myocardial histology obtained during follow-up, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of diffuse HE in the diagnosis of CA were 93%, 70%, and 84%, respectively. Conclusions Among patients suspected of CA, the presence of diffuse HE by visual T1 assessment accurately identifies patients with histologically-proven CA and is a strong predictor of mortality.},

It was found that patients with completed coronary occlusions, usually with distal portions reconstituted by collateral, had favorable prognoses with prolonged longevity. Patients with multiple high grade narrowings of the coronary arteries, on the other hand, had poor prognoses with high attrition rates. The more stenotic lesions present in the coronary arteries, the higher the attrition rates. Completed coronary occlusions, therefore, have been classified as nonprecarious while local coronary stenoses greater than 50 percent of the lumen diameter have been classified as degrees of precariousness according to the number of lesions present. When compared with classification by number of diseased vessels and by arteriographic score of Friesinger, the nonprecarious cases had better prognoses than the precarious.},

abstract = {At the most severe end of the spectrum of acute coronary syndromes is ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), which usually occurs when a fibrin-rich thrombus completely occludes an epicardial coronary artery. The diagnosis of STEMI is based on clinical characteristics and persistent ST-segment elevation as demonstrated by 12-lead electrocardiography. Patients with STEMI should undergo rapid assessment for reperfusion therapy, and a reperfusion strategy should be implemented promptly after the patient's contact with the health care system. Two methods are currently available for establishing timely coronary reperfusion: primary percutaneous coronary intervention and fibrinolytic therapy. Percutaneous coronary intervention is the preferred method but is not always available. Antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants are critical adjuncts to reperfusion. This article summarizes the current evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and management of STEMI. This summary is followed by a brief discussion of the role of noninvasive stress testing in the assessment of patients with acute coronary syndrome and their selection for coronary revascularization. {\textcopyright} 2009 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.},

abstract = {Infective endocarditis (IE) is among the most severe infectious disease, the prevention of which has not decreased its incidence. The age of patients and the rate of health care-associated IE have increased as a consequence of medical progress. The prevention strategies have been subjected to an important debate and nonspecific hygiene measures are now placed above the use of antibiotic prophylaxis. Indeed, the level of evidence of antibiotic prophylaxis efficiency is low and the indications of its prescription have been restricted in the recent international guidelines. In cases carrying a high suspicion of IE, efforts should be made to rapidly identify patients with a definite or highly probable diagnosis of IE and to find the causative pathogen to ensure that appropriate treatment, including urgent valvular surgery, begins promptly. Although echocardiography remains the main accurate imaging modality to identify endocardial lesions associated with IE, it can be negative or inconclusive especially in cases of prosthetic valve or other intracardiac devices. Recent studies demonstrated the diagnostic value of other imaging strategies including cardiac computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography/CT, radiolabelled leukocyte single-photon emission CT/CT, and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging. Novel perspectives on the management of endocarditis are emerging and offer a hope for decreasing the rate of residual deaths by accelerating the processes of diagnosis, risk stratification, and instauration of antimicrobial therapy. Moreover, the rapid transfer of high-risk patients to specialized mediosurgical centres (IE team), the development of new surgical modalities, and close long-term follow-up are of crucial importance. {\textcopyright} 2014 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To review left ventricular assist device physiology, initial postoperative management, common complications, trouble shooting and management of hypotension, and other common ICU problems. DATA SOURCE Narrative review of relevant medical literature. DATA SYNTHESIS Left ventricular assist devices prolong the lives of patients with end-stage heart failure, and their use is increasing. Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices have replaced first-generation pulsatile devices. These patients present unique management concerns. In the immediate postimplant period, care must be taken to support the unassisted right ventricle. Invasive monitors for blood pressure, pulmonary artery catheterization, and echocardiography are essential to optimize left ventricular assist device settings and cardiac performance. Anticoagulation is necessary to prevent devastating thrombotic and embolic complications, but bleeding is a major source of morbidity due to inherent bleeding diatheses and prescribed anticoagulants. Infection of the device can be life threatening, and all infections must be aggressively treated to avoid seeding the device. Patients are at risk of ventricular arrhythmias because of their underlying disease, as well as the placement and position of the inflow cannula. Aortic valve stenosis and insufficiency develop over time and can lead to thrombosis or heart failure. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation with chest compressions must be performed with care or not at all due to risk of dislodging the device. CONCLUSION Intensivists are increasingly likely to encounter patients requiring mechanical circulatory support with left ventricular assist devices at various points in the trajectory of their disease, from the immediate postimplant period to subsequent admissions for complications, and at end of life. A basic understanding of left ventricular assist device physiology is essential to the safe and effective care of these patients.},

abstract = {Cardiogenic shock (CS) occurs in â5% to 8% of patients hospitalized with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Recent research has suggested that the peripheral vasculature and neurohormonal and cytokine systems play a role in the pathogenesis and persistence of CS. Early revascularization for CS improves survival substantially. New mechanical approaches to treatment are available, and clinical trials are feasible even in this high-risk population. Most importantly, hospital survivors have an excellent chance for long-term survival with good quality of life. This review will outline the causes, pathophysiology, and treatment of CS with a focus on CS complicating myocardial infarction (MI.) The case will be made for viewing CS as a serious disorder with a high early death rate, but one that is treatable and that, if approached aggressively, can result in full recovery.\n\nCS is a state of end-organ hypoperfusion due to cardiac failure. The definition of CS includes hemodynamic parameters: persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure <80 to 90 mm Hg or mean arterial pressure 30 mm Hg lower than baseline) with severe reduction in cardiac index (<1.8 L {\textperiodcentered} minâ1 {\textperiodcentered} mâ2 without support or <2.0 to 2.2 L {\textperiodcentered} minâ1 {\textperiodcentered} mâ2 with support) and adequate or elevated filling pressure (eg, left ventricular [LV] end-diastolic pressure >18 mm Hg or right ventricular [RV] end-diastolic pressure >10 to 15 mm Hg). The diagnosis is usually made with the help of pulmonary artery (PA) catheterization; however, Doppler echocardiography may also be used to confirm elevation of LV filling pressures.1 Hypoperfusion may be manifest clinically by cool extremities, decreased urine output, and/or alteration in mental status. Hemodynamic abnormalities form a spectrum that ranges from mild hypoperfusion to profound shock, and the short-term outcome is directly related to the severity of hemodynamic derangement.\n\nMI with LV failure remains {\ldots}},

abstract = {Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the heart frequently resulting from viral infections and/or post-viral immune-mediated responses. It is one of the important causes of dilated cardiomyopathy worldwide. The diagnosis is presumed on clinical presentation and noninvasive diagnostic methods such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Endomyocardial biopsy remains the gold standard for in vivo diagnosis of myocarditis. The therapeutic and prognostic benefits of endomyocardial biopsy results have recently been demonstrated in several clinical trials. Although remarkable advances in diagnosis, understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms, and treatment of acute myocarditis were gained during the last years, no standard treatment strategies could be defined as yet, apart from standard heart failure therapy and physical rest. In severe cases, mechanical support or heart transplantation may become necessary. There is some evidence that immunosuppressive and immunomodulating therapy are effective for chronic, virus-negative inflammatory cardiomyopathy. Further investigations by controlled, randomized studies are needed to definitively determine their role in the treatment of myocarditis. {\textcopyright} 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {Right ventricular (RV) ischaemia complicates up to 50% of inferior myocardial infarctions (MIs), though isolated RV myocardial infarction (RVMI) is extremely rare. Although the RV shows good long term recovery, in the short term RV involvement portends a worse prognosis to uncomplicated inferior MI, with haemodynamic and electrophysiologic complications increasing in-hospital morbidity and mortality. Acute RV shock has an equally high mortality to left ventricular (LV) shock. Identification of RV involvement, particularly in the setting of hypotension, can help anticipate and prevent complications and has important management implications which are distinct from the management of patients presenting with LV infarction. Reperfusion therapy, particularly by primary percutaneous coronary intervention, hastens and enhances RV functional recovery that occurs to near normality in most patients. The diagnostic methods for RVMI are discussed, including clinical, electrocardiographic, and various imaging modalities as well as the RV pathophysiology that underpins the specifics of RVMI management.},

abstract = {Inotropic and vasopressor agents have increasingly become a therapeutic cornerstone for the management of several important cardiovascular syndromes. In broad terms, these substances have excitatory and inhibitory actions on the heart and vascular smooth muscle, as well as important metabolic, central nervous system, and presynaptic autonomic nervous system effects. They are generally administered with the assumption that short- to medium-term clinical recovery will be facilitated by enhancement of cardiac output (CO) or vascular tone that has been severely compromised by often life-threatening clinical conditions. The clinical efficacy of these agents has been investigated largely through examination of their impact on hemodynamic end points, and clinical practice has been driven in part by expert opinion, extrapolation from animal studies, and physician preference. Our aim is to review the mechanisms of action of common inotropes and vasopressors and to examine the contemporary evidence for their use in important cardiac conditions.},

abstract = {The concept of the ventricular gradient was conceived in the mind of Frank Wilson in the early 1930s. Wilson, a mathematical genius, believed that the calculation of the ventricular gradient yielded information that was not otherwise obtainable. The method of analysis was not utilized by clinicians at large because the concept was not easy to understand and because the method used to compute the direction of the ventricular gradient was so time consuming that clinicians could not use it. Grant utilized the concept to create vector electrocardiography, but he believed that if his method of analysis was used, it was not often necessary to compute the direction of the ventricular gradient. He did, however, describe an easy way to compute the direction of the ventricular gradient. The current major clinical use of the ventricular gradient is to identify primary and secondary T-wave abnormalities in an electrocardiogram showing left or right ventricular hypertrophy or left or right ventricular conduction abnormalities. In addition, the author uses the term ventricular time gradient instead of ventricular gradient in an effort to clarify the concept. Finally, the author discusses the possible clinical significance of a normally directed, but shorter than normal, ventricular time gradient, an attribute that has not been emphasized previously.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Drug safety precautions recommend monitoring of the corrected QT interval. To determine which QT correction formula to use in an automated QT-monitoring algorithm in our electronic medical record, we studied rate correction performance of different QT correction formulae and their impact on risk assessment for mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS All electrocardiograms (ECGs) in patients >18Â years with sinus rhythm, normal QRS duration and rate <90Â beats per minute (bpm) in the University Hospitals of Leuven (Leuven, Belgium) during a 2-month period were included. QT correction was performed with Bazett, Fridericia, Framingham, Hodges, and Rautaharju formulae. In total, 6609 patients were included (age, 59.8Â±16.2Â years; 53.6% male and heart rate 68.8Â±10.6Â bpm). Optimal rate correction was observed using Fridericia and Framingham; Bazett performed worst. A healthy subset showed 99% upper limits of normal for Bazett above current clinical standards: men 472Â ms (95% CI, 464-478Â ms) and women 482Â ms (95% CI 474-490Â ms). Multivariate Cox regression, including age, heart rate, and prolonged QTc, identified Framingham (hazard ratio [HR], 7.31; 95% CI, 4.10-13.05) and Fridericia (HR, 5.95; 95% CI, 3.34-10.60) as significantly better predictors of 30-day all-cause mortality than Bazett (HR, 4.49; 95% CI, 2.31-8.74). In a point-prevalence study with haloperidol, the number of patients classified to be at risk for possibly harmful QT prolongation could be reduced by 50% using optimal QT rate correction. CONCLUSIONS Fridericia and Framingham correction formulae showed the best rate correction and significantly improved prediction of 30-day and 1-year mortality. With current clinical standards, Bazett overestimated the number of patients with potential dangerous QTc prolongation, which could lead to unnecessary safety measurements as withholding the patient of first-choice medication.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) is the traditional method of assessing the duration of repolarization. Prolonged heart rate-corrected QT interval is associated with higher risk of mortality in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and in the general population. However, the QTc is typically not evaluated when QRS duration is > or =120 ms, because increased QRS duration (QRSd) contributes to QT interval prolongation. In these circumstances, the JT interval has been proposed as a more valid way to assess ventricular repolarization. METHODS AND RESULTS: To allow for variation in heart rate, corrected JT interval (JTc) was defined as QTc-QRSd. Using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, JTc and QTc were compared for their prognostic associations with incident CHD events among 14 696 men and women who were CHD-free at baseline, having either normal conduction or wide QRS complex. Among individuals with normal QRS duration, logistic regression adjusted for age, hypertensive status, diabetes, race, systolic blood pressure, smoking, HDL and LDL cholesterol, R-R interval, and menopausal status in women showed QTc and JTc were nonpredictive of future coronary events in men but significant in women. In individuals with wide QRS complex (QRSd > or =120 ms), similar analyses showed JTc had a significant prognostic advantage compared with QTc in men but not in women, among whom only 11 events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The JTc is a simple measurement that is a significant independent predictor of incident CHD events in men with wide QRS complex.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The oscillometric method of measuring blood pressure with an automated cuff yields valid estimates of mean pressure but questionable estimates of systolic and diastolic pressures. Existing algorithms are sensitive to differences in pulse pressure and artery stiffness. Some are closely guarded trade secrets. Accurate extraction of systolic and diastolic pressures from the envelope of cuff pressure oscillations remains an open problem in biomedical engineering.\n\nMETHODS: A new analysis of relevant anatomy, physiology and physics reveals the mechanisms underlying the production of cuff pressure oscillations as well as a way to extract systolic and diastolic pressures from the envelope of oscillations in any individual subject. Stiffness characteristics of the compressed artery segment can be extracted from the envelope shape to create an individualized mathematical model. The model is tested with a matrix of possible systolic and diastolic pressure values, and the minimum least squares difference between observed and predicted envelope functions indicates the best fit choices of systolic and diastolic pressure within the test matrix.\n\nRESULTS: The model reproduces realistic cuff pressure oscillations. The regression procedure extracts systolic and diastolic pressures accurately in the face of varying pulse pressure and arterial stiffness. The root mean squared error in extracted systolic and diastolic pressures over a range of challenging test scenarios is 0.3 mmHg.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: A new algorithm based on physics and physiology allows accurate extraction of systolic and diastolic pressures from cuff pressure oscillations in a way that can be validated, criticized, and updated in the public domain.},

The rhythm of the heart is normally controlled by a natural pace- maker (the sinoatrial node) in the right upper chamber that beats about 60 times per minute at rest and can increase with exercise.

abstract = {In patients with pacemakers, hyperkalaemia causes three important abnormalities that usually become manifest when the K level exceeds 7 mEq/L: (i) widening of the paced QRS complex from delayed intraventricular conduction velocity, (ii) Increased atrial and ventricular pacing thresholds that may cause failure to capture. In this respect, the atria are more susceptible to loss of capture than the ventricles, and (iii) Increased latency (usually with ventricular pacing) manifested by a greater delay of the interval from the pacemaker stimulus to the onset of depolarization. First-degree ventricular pacemaker exit block may progress to second-degree Wenckebach (type I) exit block characterized by gradual prolongation of the interval from the pacemaker stimulus to the onset of the paced QRS complex ultimately resulting in an ineffectual stimulus. The disturbance may then progress to 2 : 1, 3 : 1 pacemaker exit block, etc., and eventually to complete exit block with total lack of capture. Ventricular undersensing is uncommonly observed because of frequent antibradycardia pacing. During managed ventricular pacing, hyperkalaemia-induced marked first-degree atrioventricular block may induce a pacemaker syndrome. With implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) oversensing of the paced or spontaneous T-wave may occur. The latter may cause inappropriate shocks. A raised impedance from the right ventricular coil to the superior vena cava coil may become an important sign of hyperkalaemia in the asymptomatic or the minimally symptomatic ICD patient.},

The primary end point was a response with respect to mean arterial pressure at hour 3 after the start of infusion, with response defined as an increase from baseline of at least 10 mm Hg or an increase to at least 75 mm Hg, without an increase in the dose of background vasopressors. ResultsA total of 344 patients were assigned to one of the two regimens; 321 received a study intervention (163 received angiotensin II, and 158 received placebo) and were included in the analysis. The primary end point was reached by more patients in the angiote...},
