abstract = {Background: Prior studies have consistently demonstrated that blacks have an approximate 2-fold higher incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) than whites; however, these analyses have lacked individual-level sociodemographic, medical comorbidity, and behavioral health data. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether racial differences in SCD incidence are attributable to differences in the prevalence of risk factors or rather to underlying susceptibility to fatal arrhythmias. Methods: The Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study is a prospective, population-based cohort of adults from across the United States. Associations between race and SCD defined per National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute criteria were assessed. Results: Among 22,507 participants (9,416 blacks and 13,091 whites) without a history of clinical cardiovascular disease, there were 174 SCD events (67 whites and 107 blacks) over a median follow-up of 6.1 years (interquartile range: 4.6 to 7.3 years). The age-adjusted SCD incidence rate (per 1,000 person-years) was higher in blacks (1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4 to 2.2) compared with whites (0.7; 95% CI: 0.6 to 0.9), with an unadjusted hazard ratio of 2.35; 95% CI: 1.74 to 3.20. The association of black race with SCD risk remained significant after adjustment for sociodemographics, comorbidities, behavioral measures of health, intervening cardiovascular events, and competing risks of non-SCD mortality (hazard ratio: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.39 to 2.77). Conclusions: In a large biracial population of adults without a history of cardiovascular disease, SCD rates were significantly higher in blacks as compared with whites. These racial differences were not fully explained by demographics, adverse socioeconomic measures, cardiovascular risk factors, and behavioral measures of health.},

Schruers, Klaus Wiedemann, C{\"{u}}neyt Demiralay Abstract Background The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) and the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are considered to play the most crucial role in the pathophysiology of stress responsiveness and are increasingly studied together. However, only few studies have simultaneously assessed HPA axis and ANS activity to investigate their direct interaction in pathophysiology, while no study so far has assessed the dynamic interplay between the two systems in healthy subjects through endocrine challenges. Methods The present study assessed the direct effects of overnight pharmacoendocrine HPA axis challenges with dexamethasone (suppression) and metyrapone (stimulation) on ANS activity at rest as determined by linear and nonlinear measures of heart rate variability (HRV) in 39 young healthy individuals. Results Findings indicated significant effects of metyrapone, but not dexamethasone on autonomic activity at rest based on HRV measures. HRV after metyrapone was overall significantly reduced in comparison to baseline or post-dexamethasone conditions, while the combined metyrapone-related reduction of HRV measures RMSSD, NN50(%) and HF(%) with concomitant increase of the unifractal scaling coefficient $\alpha$fast value jointly indicated a specifically diminished vagal activity. Conclusions We provide first data that HPA axis stimulation (metyrapone) is associated with reduced vagal tone, while HPA axis suppression (dexamethasone) has no effect on autonomic modulation of heart function. Our results support a vital role of the parasympathetic nervous system in the interplay between ANS and HPA axis and, thus, in the modulation of stress-related cardiovascular responsiveness and the susceptibility to stress-related disorders.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Abnormal QT intervals, long QT or short QT, have been epidemiologically linked with sudden cardiac death because of ventricular fibrillation (VF). Consequently, Food and Drug Administration recommends testing all pharmacological agents for QT toxicity as a risk factor for cardiac toxicity. Such tests assess QT/QTc interval, which represents ventricular depolarization and repolarization. However, the current QT toxicity analysis does not account for the well-known anisotropy in cardiac tissue conductivity. Mines demonstrated in 1913 that cardiac wavelength ($\lambda$) determines inducibility of reentrant arrhythmia, where both repolarization time or action potential duration and conduction velocity determine $\lambda$=action potential duration×conduction velocity. We aimed to determine the role of anisotropic wavelength in inducibility of VF in explanted human left ventricular preparations. We tested the hypothesis that 3-dimensional cardiac wavelength, which takes into account anisotropic cardiac tissue conductivity, can accurately predict VF sustainability. METHODS We conducted panoramic optical mapping of coronary perfused human left ventricular wedge preparations subjected to pharmacologically induced shortening and prolongation of action potential duration, by IK,ATP agonist pinacidil and antagonist glybenclamide, respectively. This measured action potential duration, conduction velocity, and thus determined pacing cycle length-dependent wavelengths in longitudinal ($\lambda$L), transverse ($\lambda$TV), and transmural ($\lambda$TM) directions using S1S1 pacing protocol, from which wavelength volume (V$\lambda$) was determined, as V$\lambda$=$\lambda$L×$\lambda$TV×$\lambda$TM, and compared with tissue volume. We tested a hypothesis that tissue volume/V$\lambda$ ratio can predict VF sustainability. RESULTS At baseline, at pacing rate of 240 beats per minute, the wavelengths were $\lambda$L=9.6±0.6 cm, $\lambda$TV=4.2±0.3 cm, and $\lambda$TM=5.8±0.2 cm, respectively (n=7), and thus V$\lambda$=246.4±42.1 cm3. Administration of pinacidil at escalating concentrations progressively decreased V$\lambda$, and VF became sustained, when tissue volume/V$\lambda$ was above safety factor $\kappa$=4.4±0.6 (n=9) during rapid pacing. Treatment with glybenclamide decreased VT/V$\lambda$ below $\kappa$ at any pacing rate and prevented VF sustainability. CONCLUSIONS Sustained VF was only sustained in ventricular volume exceeding critical V$\lambda$=$\lambda$L×$\lambda$TV×$\lambda$TM.},

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent and independently associated with atrial fibrillation among patients with HCM. Objective To determine the relationship between non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and OSA in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Methods One hundred thirty consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of HOCM in Fuwai Hospital between September 2017 and May 2018 were included. Polysomnography and Holter electrocardiography were performed in all patients. Results Of 130 patients, 72 (55.4%) were diagnosed with OSA, including 38 with mild, 21 with moderate, and 13 with severe OSA, and 27 (20.8%) patients had NSVT. The prevalence of NSVT increased with the severity of OSA (none, mild, moderate, and severe: 12.1%, 15.8%, 33.3%, and 53.8%, respectively; p for trend Conclusion The presence and severity of OSA in patients with HOCM is independently associated with NSVT, which is a risk factor for SCD and cardiovascular death in this population.},

Coppler, Cameron Dezfulian, Maria Baldwin, Bradley Molyneaux, Alexandra Urban, Jon C. Rittenberger, Clifton W. Callaway, Jonathan Elmer, on behalf of the Pittsburgh Post-Cardiac Arrest Service Abstract Background Epileptiform activity is common after cardiac arrest, although intensity of electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring may affect detection rates. Prior work has grouped these patterns together as “malignant,” without considering discrete subtypes. We describe the incidence of distinct patterns in the ictal-interictal spectrum at two centers and their association with outcomes. Methods We analyzed a retrospective cohort of comatose post-arrest patients admitted at two academic centers from January 2011 to October 2014. One center uses routine continuous EEG, the other acquires “spot” EEG at the treating physicians' discretion. We reviewed all available EEG data and classified epileptiform patterns. We abstracted antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) administrations from the electronic medical record. We compared apparent incidence of each pattern between centers, and compared outcomes (awakening from coma, survival to discharge, discharge modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-2) across EEG patterns and number of AEDs administered. Results We included 818 patients. Routine continuous EEG was associated with a higher apparent incidence of polyspike burst-suppression (25% vs 13% P Conclusion We found high rates of epileptiform EEG findings, regardless of intensity of EEG monitoring. The association of distinct ictal-interictal EEG findings with outcome was variable.},

abstract = {Publication date: Available online 23 December 2018 Source: Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry Author(s): Andrea Locci, Graziano Pinna Abstract Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by drastic alterations in mood, emotions, social abilities and cognition. Notably, one aspect of PTSD, particularly in veterans, is its comorbidity with suicide. Elevated aggressiveness predicts high-risk to suicide in humans and despite the difficulty in reproducing a complex human suicidal behavior in rodents, aggressive behavior is a well reproducible behavioral trait of suicide. PTSD animal models are based on a peculiar phenotype, including exaggerated fear memory, anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors associated with neurochemical dysregulations in emotional brain circuitry. The endocannabinoid and the neurosteroid systems regulate emotions and stress responses, and recent evidence shows these two systems are interrelated and critically compromised in neuropsychiatric disorders. For instance, levels of the neurosteroid, allopregnanolone, as well as those of the endocannabinoids, anandamide and its congener, palmitoylethanolamide are decreased in PTSD. Similarly, the endocannabinoid system and neurosteroid biosynthesis are altered in suicidal individuals. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the only FDA-approved treatments for PTSD and depression, fail to help half of the treatment-seeking patients. This highlights the need for developing biomarker-based efficient therapies. One promising hypothesis points to stimulation of allopregnanolone biosynthesis as a valid end-point to predict treatment response in PTSD patients. This review highlights running findings on the role of the endocannabinoid and neurosteroid systems in PTSD and suicidal behavior both in a preclinical and clinical perspective. A specific focus is given to predictive PTSD/suicide animal models. Ultimately, we discuss the idea that disruption of neurosteroid and endocannabinoid biosynthesis may offer novel promising biomarker candidates to develop new treatments for PTSD and, perhaps, suicidal behavior.},

abstract = {Sudden cardiac death accounted for 42% of all firefighter duty-related fatalities over the last decade. This retrospective study analyzed available medical examiner records for duty-related firefighter fatalities among male firefighters 18 to 65 years of age that occurred between 1999 and 2014 and reported the pathoanatomic substrate for cardiac-related fatalities. Odds of duty-related cardiac death during specific duties compared with fire station duties were calculated by pathoanatomic substrate. There were 285 cardiac fatalities. Of fatalities, 80% had evidence at autopsy of coronary heart disease (CHD) and increased heart size (cardiomegaly and/or left ventricular hypertrophy). CHD alone, cardiomegaly or left ventricular hypertrophy, and causes other than CHD or increased heart size were identified in 7.7%, 6.0%, and 6.7% of fatalities, respectively. The largest proportion of deaths occurred during fire suppression (33%), although only 1% of annual occupational time was estimated to be spent performing this duty. For deaths attributed to CHD and increased heart size, fire suppression, alarm response, and physical training were associated with approximately a 112-fold, eightfold, and sevenfold increased risk of cardiac death, respectively, compared with station duties. In conclusion, the majority of firefighters who suffered a duty-related cardiac death had CHD and increased heart size, which was associated with a markedly increased risk of death during fire suppression compared with station duties. Targeted occupational medical screening for CHD and increased heart size may reduce duty-related cardiac deaths among firefighters.},
