abstract = {Neural remodeling in the autonomic nervous system contributes to sudden cardiac death. The fabric of cardiac excitability and propagation is controlled by autonomic innervation. Heart disease predisposes to malignant ventricular arrhythmias by causing neural remodeling at the level of the myocardium, the intrinsic cardiac ganglia, extracardiac intrathoracic sympathetic ganglia, extrathoracic ganglia, spinal cord, and the brainstem, as well as the higher centers and the cortex. Therapeutic strategies at each of these levels aim to restore the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches. Understanding this complex neural network will provide important therapeutic insights into the treatment of sudden cardiac death.},

abstract = {responses to mental stress in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) are associated with increased risk for subsequent cardiovas-cular events. The integrated baroreflex gain and its mechanical and neural component were estimated and then related to the blood pressure and heart rate responses to simulated real-life stressors: mental arithmetic and public speaking. Eighteen healthy individuals (aged 61 8 yr) and 29 individuals with documented CAD but no other comorbidities (aged 59 8 yr) were studied. Heart rate and blood pressures were continuously assessed before, during preparation for, and during performance of a math task and a speech task. The assessment of beat-to-beat carotid diameters during baroreflex engagement was used to estimate the integrated baroreflex gain and its mechanical and neural component. The CAD subjects demonstrated significantly greater increases in heart rate and blood pressures for the performance of the speech task. However, there were no group differences in integrated cardiovagal baroreflex gain or either mechanical or neural baroreflex component. These findings indicate that the augmented pressor responses in CAD do not result from a generalized arterial baroreflex deficit.},

abstract = {Spontaneous activity of 226 neurons was recorded from in situ mediastinal ganglia in 10 dogs. Forty-two percent of these were active during specific phases of the cardiac cycle, primarily during systole. Cardiovascular-related activity occurred when systolic pressure was between approximately 70 and 185 mmHg (1 mmHg = 133.3 Pa) whether the pressure was altered by positive inotropic pharmacological agents or cross clamping of the aorta. Twenty percent of the identified neurons displayed respiratory-related activity which occurred during positive pressure inflation or deflation. Thirty-eight percent of the identified neurons displayed bursts of activity or sporadic activity. The activity of 17% of the identified neurons was altered by gentle mechanical distortion of localized regions of the neck, left elbow, ventral thoracic wall, ventral abdominal wall, superior vena cava, right ventricle, or aorta. In the majority of instances cardiovascular- or respiratory-related activity persisted following acute decentralization, indicating that neurons in mediastinal ganglia can function in the absence of influences of central nervous system neurons. Five percent of the identified neurons were activated by single 1-4 ms, 10-20 V stimuli delivered at 0.5 Hz to the nerves connected with either the cranial or the caudal poles of the mediastinal ganglion or the ansae. These neurons were activated after a fixed latency when 0.5 Hz was used and in most instances when 10 Hz was used. These data indicate that 5% or less of the neurons identified projected axons out of the mediastinal ganglia investigated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Efferent sympathetic activities were simultaneously recorded from two thoracic cardiac nerves in 33 chloralose-anesthetized dogs. Efferent innervation patterns were determined by electrical stimulation prior to recording in each animal. One of the nerves selected for recording was shown to innervate the proposed ischemic region, whereas the other nerve was selected because it was shown to innervate nonischemic regions. Left ventricular ischemia was produced by occlusion of a branch of either the left anterior descending (LAD) or left circumflex (LCX) coronary arteries. Heart rate was paced. Cardiac postganglionic sympathetic efferent activities were recorded during a 30-min coronary occlusion in 22 animals. Thirty minutes after LAD occlusion (n = 10), postganglionic sympathetic activity to ischemic myocardium was decreased (84 +/- 5% of control; P less than 0.05) while activity to nonischemic myocardium was unchanged. Thirty minutes after LCX occlusion (n = 12), postganglionic sympathetic activity to ischemic myocardium was also decreased (87 +/- 3% of control; P less than 0.01); however, sympathetic activity to nonischemic myocardium was increased (159 +/- 10% of control; P less than 0.001). Thus, in the anesthetized canine, regional left ventricular ischemia elicits differential sympathetic neural responses that are dependent on the location of the ischemic myocardium as well as the efferent destinations of the nerves. Changes in cardiac postganglionic sympathetic efferent activities are characterized by decreased activity to ischemic regions, with either no change or increased activity to nonischemic regions.},

abstract = {Patients with recurrent unexplained syncope may have cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor responses provokable with head-up tilt with or without exogenous beta-adrenergic stimulation. Although these responses are believed to be neurally mediated, the neural mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Numerous studies have documented peripheral vasodilation, hypotension, and bradycardia at the time of syncope and several case reports have shown sudden withdrawal of vasoconstrictor sympathetic neural outflow to skeletal muscle in human subjects. In cats and rats, a similar response can be provoked with hemorrhage and is prevented by interruption of cardiac vagal C-fiber afferents. In dogs, however, section of these fibers does not prevent the development of a vasodepressor response. The provocation of vasodepressor syncope during nitroprusside infusion in a heart transplant recipient with presumed ventricular denervation also suggests that cardiac afferent nerves may not be required for the development of vasodepressor responses in humans. Other potential mechanisms include release of endogenous opioids or nitric oxide that may inhibit sympathetic nerve firing, and primary central nervous system activation (as in partial seizures) that triggers cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor responses. This article reviews our current understanding of the mechanisms involved in the development of neurally mediated syncope.},

abstract = {91284342 Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia/Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond BACKGROUND. Left ventricular sympathetic afferent nerves are located mainly in superficial epicardial layers. Reflex excitatory responses mediated by sympathetic afferent nerves have been observed during myocardial ischemia in cats and humans but not in dogs. Previous canine studies have induced ischemia by occlusion of a coronary artery. Extensive collateral circulation in the canine heart may limit ischemia of epicardial layers during simple coronary occlusion, resulting in little stimulation of sympathetic afferent nerves and minimal reflex excitatory responses. METHODS AND RESULTS. In anesthetized dogs with sinoaortic and vagal deafferentation, we determined whether reflex sympathoexcitatory responses mediated by sympathetic afferents occurred during transmural myocardial ischemia. Reflex sympathoexcitation was quantitated by direct recording from either efferent renal (n = 20) or cardiac (n = 5) sympathetic nerves. Responses of arterial pressure and efferent sympathetic nerve activity were measured during simple occlusion of the anterior descending artery (LAD alone) and during LAD occlusion with a circumflex stenosis (LAD + CIRC). This circumflex stenosis was adjusted to abolish coronary vasodilator reserve without reducing basal flow. We observed significantly greater reflex increases in renal (32 +/- 5%) and cardiac (58 +/- 15%) nerve activity during LAD + CIRC than during LAD alone (14 +/- 6% and 8 +/- 7%, respectively). Reflex changes in renal nerve activity during LAD + CIRC were abolished by interruption of cardiac sympathetic afferent pathways (n = 5). In eight experiments, myocardial blood flow was measured during the two coronary occlusions. These experiments confirmed that LAD + CIRC elicited more transmural ischemia in the LAD distribution than did LAD alone. However, these experiments also revealed that LAD + CIRC elicited endocardial ischemia in the circumflex distribution. In five additional experiments, regional sympathetic deafferentation of the posterior left ventricle by epicardial application of 88% phenol along the atrioventricular groove had no significant effect on renal nerve responses to LAD + CIRC (36 +/- 5% increase before phenol versus 31 +/- 3% increase after phenol). These results indicate that endocardial ischemia in the circumflex distribution did not contribute to the reflex increases in nerve activity that were noted during LAD + CIRC. CONCLUSIONS. Reflex sympathoexcitation mediated by cardiac sympathetic afferents can be elicited in dogs. However, these responses are significant only during ischemia that is transmural and involves the superficial epicardial layers of the left ventricle},

These hearts (n = 10) had baseline heart rates of 146 +/- 2 beats x min(-1) which could be increased to 240 +/- 11 beats x min(-1) by sympathetic stimulation (15 Hz) and decreased to 74 +/- 11 beats x min(-1) by stimulation of the vagus nerve (right vagus, 7 Hz). This model has the advantage of isolated preparations, with the absence of influence from circulating hormones and haemodynamic reflexes, and also that of in vivo preparations where direct nerve stimulation is possible without the need to use pharmacological agents. Data are presented characterising the preparation with respect to the effects of autonomic nerve stimulation on intrinsic heart rate and atrioventricular conduction at different stimulation frequencies. We show that stimulation of the right and left vagus nerve have differential effects on heart rate and atrioventricular conduction.},

abstract = {Cardiovascular autonomic diabetic neuropathy (CADN) may carry an increased risk of mortality. However, in previous studies the prognosis of patients with CADN seemed to be influenced by life-threatening macro- and microvascular complications which had already been present at the start of the study period. Between 1981 and 1983, 1015 diabetic patients have been examined for CADN (abnormal heart rate variation at rest and during deep respiration) at the Diabetes Research Institute, Dusseldorf. Thirty-five patients (28 with Type 1 diabetes, 7 with Type 2 diabetes) with CADN have been retrospectively recruited and reviewed 8 years later and compared with 35 patients without CADN who were matched for sex, age, and duration of diabetes. Exclusion criteria for entry into the study included severe micro- or macrovascular complications, such as proliferative retinopathy, proteinuria or symptomatic coronary artery disease. During the 8-year observation period, 8 patients with CADN and 1 patient without CADN died. The survival rate estimates steadily declined in patients with CADN over the whole period studied. The 8-year survival rate estimate in patients with CADN was 77% compared with 97% in those with normal autonomic function (p < 0.05). Deaths were mainly due to macrovascular diseases (n = 3) and sudden unexpected deaths (n = 3). One patient with CADN died after an episode of severe hypoglycaemia. Among the deceased patients, coefficient of variation of R-R intervals during deep breathing was significantly reduced when compared with those who survived (1.04 (plus or minus) 0.5% vs 1.87 (plus or minus) 1.0%; p < 0.05), and symptoms of autonomic neuropathy (orthostatic hypotension, gastroparesis, gustatory sweating) were more frequent (7/8 vs 10/27 patients). The mean QTc interval was not different between the groups. These results suggest a relatively poor prognosis of patients with CADN in the absence of clinically detectable micro- and macrovascular complications.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to develop a technique to selectively increase the sympathetic tone to the heart by cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation (SNS). BACKGROUND: Access to the cardiac sympathetic neurons may allow modulating the adrenergic tone of the heart while avoiding systemic side effects. METHODS: Cardiac sympathetic nerves course within neural sleeves along the subclavian artery. Because of this proximity, transvascular SNS was attempted with electrode catheters inside the subclavian artery in 16 pigs. RESULTS: Right/left (R-/L-) SNS (20 Hz) during ventricular pacing at 200/min evoked a >100% increase of left ventricular systolic pressure (baseline: 51 ± 1 mm Hg; L-SNS: 118 ± 26 mm Hg; R-SNS: 116 ± 33 mm Hg; p < 0.001) while systemic vascular resistance remained unchanged. There was a sigmoid dose-response curve with rapid on- and offset of the effect during SNS initiation/cessation. Positive inotropic effects persisted for 12 h of continued SNS (n = 4). Besides positive dromotropic effects, L-SNS/R-SNS yielded a 41% and 77% sinus rate increase, respectively.

abstract = {Recent investigations indicate a site of cardiac representation within the left insular cortex of the rat. Moreover, the results of lesion studies suggest left-sided insular dominance for sympathetic cardiovascular effects. It is unclear whether similar representation exists within the human insular cortex. Five epileptic patients underwent intraoperative insular stimulation prior to temporal lobectomy for seizure control. On stimulation of the left insular cortex, bradycardia and depressor responses were more frequently produced than tachycardia and pressor effects (p less than 0.005). The converse applied for the right insular cortex. We believe this to be the first demonstration of cardiovascular changes elicitable during insular stimulation in humans, and of lateralization of such responses for a cortical site. In humans, unlike the rat, there appears to be right-sided dominance for sympathetic effects. These findings may be of relevance in predicting the autonomic effects of stroke in humans and in the explanation of sudden unexpected epileptic death.},

@article{Fukuda2015,
abstract = {Afferent and efferent cardiac neurotransmission via the cardiac nerves intricately modulates nearly all physiological functions of the heart (chronotropy, dromotropy, lusitropy, and inotropy). Afferent information from the heart is transmitted to higher levels of the nervous system for processing (intrinsic cardiac nervous system, extracardiac-intrathoracic ganglia, spinal cord, brain stem, and higher centers), which ultimately results in efferent cardiomotor neural impulses (via the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves). This system forms interacting feedback loops that provide physiological stability for maintaining normal rhythm and life-sustaining circulation. This system also ensures that there is fine-tuned regulation of sympathetic–parasympathetic balance in the heart under normal and stressed states in the short (beat to beat), intermediate (minutes to hours), and long term (days to years). This important neurovisceral/autonomic nervous system also plays a major role in the pathophysiology and progression of heart disease, including heart failure and arrhythmias leading to sudden cardiac death. Transdifferentiation of neurons in heart failure, functional denervation, cardiac and extracardiac neural remodeling has also been identified and characterized during the progression of disease. Recent advances in understanding the cellular and molecular processes governing innervation and the functional control of the myocardium in health and disease provide a rational mechanistic basis for the development of neuraxial therapies for preventing sudden cardiac death and other arrhythmias. Advances in cellular, molecular, and bioengineering realms have underscored the emergence of this area as an important avenue of scientific inquiry and therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {Antiarrhythmic drugs may aggravate or even induce ventricular arrhythmias. This type of adverse reaction is becoming more prevalent as the use of antiarrhythmic agents becomes more widespread. In a retrospective analysis of antiarrhythmic drug action, a worsening of arrhythmia was observed in 80 of 722 (11.1%) antiarrhythmic drug tests in 53 of 155 patients being treated for ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Aggravation of arrhythmias was defined by occurrence of a fourfold increase in the frequency of ventricular premature complexes, a 10-fold increase in repetitive forms, or the first emergence of sustained ventricular tachycardia coincident with time course of action of the particular drug under study. Such aggravation was noted with each of nine drugs tested: quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, propranolol, metoprolol, aprindine, mexiletine, tocainide and pindolol. The frequency of this complication for a specific drug ranged from 5.9-15.8%. Blood drug concentrations were consistently in the therapeutic range. A study of the variability of ventricular arrhythmia during 48-hour Holter monitoring and exercise stress testing in no instance showed arrhythmia enhancement commensurate with that defining aggravation. Our data suggest that this potentially serious complication is not readily predictable and requires a systematic approach to antiarrhythmic drug testing before a patient is prescribed a long-range maintenance program.},

abstract = {Stimulation of the left ansa subclavia before and after occlusion of the anterior descending artery of the dog's heart has produced significantly greater ventricular arrhythmia responses in the post-occlusion trials than in trials before occlusion. Data are presented from two series of acute experiments, Series 1 an[@Harrisd Series 2 which include findings from 11 and 16 dogs, respectively. The experiments of the two series differed in types of electrical stimuli used and in elapsed time between occlusion of the artery and the first post-occlusion stimulation. All stimulations were applied when sinus rhythm was complete and no premature beats had occurred within a specified preceding duration. The arrhythmia responses in Series 1 were more intense (except that ventricular fibrillations were equal) and more prolonged than in Series 2. Reasons are discussed but not yet clear. The increased ventricular arrhythmia response persists strongly 5 days after occlusion. Propranolol, 0.5 mg/kg, blocked the arrhythmia response to sympathetic nerve stimulation completely during a period of 45-60 min after injection, but no blockade was apparent after 80 min. Possible mechanisms of origin of the induced arrhythmias were considered and evidence presented to indicate that individually generated discharges in ectopic pacemakers produced the arrhythmia in parts of the records and that reentry was the mechanism in other parts, particularly during approach to onset of ventricular fibrillation. The demonstration that brief periods of stimulation of sympathetic nerve strands to dog's hearts after coronary occlusion can produce ventricular arrhythmias of all degrees of severity including ventricular fibrillation suggests that emotional excitation of a myocardial infarction patient may induce similar ventricular arrhythmias and thereby place life in jeopardy. {\textcopyright} 1971.},

Various cardiovascular receptors were stimulated during reflex inhibition of the central inspiratory neurones produced by electrical stimulation of both superior laryngeal nerves simultaneously, while the afferent input from the lungs was held constant by temporarily interrupting artificial respiration, the lungs being held static in their expiratory position. 3. Reflex cardioinhibitory responses were elicited by stimulation of (a) the carotid body chemoreceptors by intracarotid injections of cyanide; (b) the arterial baroreflex by controlled elevations of the blood pressure; (c) the carotid sinus baroreceptors by raising the pressure in isolated perfused carotid sinus preparations; (d) cardiac receptors by left atrial injections of veratridine, and (e) pulmonary C fibres (including J receptors) by right atrial injections of phenyl biguanide. 4. The effects of single inflations of the lungs on these reflex cardioinhibitory responses were studied and compared with the effects of the various inputs alone. 5. Stepwise increases in lung volume, while having no consistent effect on arterial blood pressure, progressively diminished the arterial chemoreceptor-induced bradycardia to a value of about 7% of the control response without lung inflation. The pulmonary afferents were less effective on reflex responses from other inputs, the corresponding values being: arterial baroreflex, 66%; carotid baroreceptors, 66%, and cardiac receptors, 70%. These effects of lung inflation were abolished by selective denervation of the lungs. 6. In contrast, the size of the bradycardia evoked by pulmonary C fibre stimulation was, on average, unaffected by inflation of the lungs. In some tests the response was actually increased. 7. The differential modulation by lung inflation of these reflex cardioinhibitory responses were the same after upper thoracic sympathectomy indicating that pulmonary afferents and cardiac efferents involved fibres in the vagus nerves. 8. The possible central mechanisms responsible for the differential modulation by lung inflation of cardioinhibitory reflexes are discussed.},

abstract = {The influence of tonic sympathetic and parasym-pathetic nervous system activity on ventricular refractory period duration was studied in 13 mongrel dogs. Strength-interval curves were obtained from the apex of the right ventricular endocardium with a transvenous bipolar catheter. The effects of sympathetic activity were assessed by unilateral and bilateral steUectomies and tonic vagal effects were studied by inducing cholinergic blockade with atropine (0.2 mg/kg) and by sectioning the cervical vagi bilaterally. Right stellectomy shifted the strength-interval curve 3-5 msec earlier (P < 0.005). In contrast, left stellectomy shifted the strength-interval curve 4-7 msec later (P < 0.001). Thus, right and left unilateral stellectomy produced opposite effects. However, when the contralateral ganglion was removed, right and left stellectomy produced qualitatively similar effects, increasing refractoriness. The net effect of bilateral stellectomy was to shift the strength-interval curve 8-10 msec later (P < 0.001) and this was primarily dependent on left stellectomy. Blockade of vagal efferent activity with atropine shifted the strength-interval curve 3-6 msec earlier (P = 0.001). Removal of vagal afferent activity by vagotomy during atropine blockade shifted the strength-interval curve 2-3 msec earlier (P = 0.03). It is concluded that both stellate ganglia exert qualitatively similar effects on cardiac refractoriness; however, the left ganglion dominates and unilateral right stellectomy produces a paradoxical decrease in refractoriness. The sympathetic effects are tonically antagonized by vagal activity. IT HAS BEEN hypothesized that electrical asymmetry of the cardiac conducting system predisposes to reentrant arrhythmias leading to ventricular fibrillation.'• 2 It is well established that stimulation of the midbrain reticular formation and of areas in the diencephalon and rhinence-phalon produces electrocardiographic changes and a diversity of arrhythmias. 3 "* The rhythm disorders that result from central neural system stimulation may be related to inhomogeneities induced in cardiac excitability. Indeed right-and left-sided sympathetic efferent outflow is distributed to different areas of the ventricular myocardium. 7 Opposite sides of the brain, furthermore, exert different effects on the heart. Thus in the cat. right hypothalamic stimulation decreases T wave amplitude, whereas a rise in amplitude attends stimulation of the contralateral side. 8 In dogs, left stellate ganglion stimulation or right stellectomy prolongs the Q-T interval and increases T wave amplitude. whereas right-sided stimulation or left stellectomy results in Twave inversion without affecting the Q-T duration. 9 It also has been demonstrated that the stellate ganglia differ in their effects on ventricular vulnerability. Ablation of the left stellate ganglion reduces the prevalence of arrhyth-mias following coronary artery occlusion and raises the ventricular fibrillation threshold, whereas an opposite effect results when the right ganglion is removed. sympathetic vagal system profoundly affects ventricular excitability. l2> ' 3 The effects of the vagus, however, are influenced substantially by the prevailing level of adrener-gic tone. 14 ' l5 These considerations have guided the modeling of the present investigation, the aim of which was to define the distinctive effects of the right and left stellate ganglia on ventricular excitability. The specific objectives were the following: (1) to determine the effect of tonic cardiac sympathetic outflow on ventricular excitability; (2) to evaluate the relative roles of right and left stellate ganglia; and (3) to assess the contribution of tonic vagal activity. Methods Thirteen mongrel dogs weighing 16-21 kg were anes-thetized with intravenous a-chloralose. 100 mg/kg. A stabilization period of at least 20 minutes was allowed between anesthetic administration and experimental interventions. Artificial ventilation was instituted using a Har-vard respirator that supplied room air via a cuffed endo-tracheal tube. A polyethylene catheter was inserted into a femoral artery for sampling arterial blood and for monitoring blood pressure. The respirator was adjusted to maintain arterial pH between 7.35 and 7.50 and PO 2 at greater than 90 mm Hg. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37 ± 1°C with a thermal blanket. Systemic arterial pressure was monitored continuously with a Sta-tham P23Db transducer. Mean pressures were obtained by electrically integrating the output of the transducer. Cervical vagosympathetic trunks were exposed bilaterally 2 cm below the level of the carotid bifurcation. Bilateral thoracotomies were performed in the 2nd intercostal space to expose the stellate ganglia. Drugs were administered via a femoral venous catheter.

@misc{Coote2013,
abstract = {There is continuing belief that cardiac parasympathetic postganglionic fibres are sparse or absent from the ventricles. This review of the literature shows that the supposition is a myth. Early studies considered that fine silver-stained fibres coursing amongst ventricle myocardial cells were most likely cardiac parasympathetic postganglionic fibres. The conclusions were later supported by acetyl cholinesterase staining using a method that appeared not to be associated with noradrenaline nerve fibres. The conclusion is critically examined in the light of several recent histological studies using the acetyl cholinesterase method and also a more definitive technique (CHAT), that suggest a widespread location of parasympathetic ganglia and a relatively dense parasympathetic innervation of ventricular muscle in a range of mammals including man. The many studies demonstrating acetylcholine release in the ventricle on vagal nerve stimulation and a high density of acetylcholine M2 receptors is in accord with this as are tests of ventricular performance from many physiological studies. Selective control of cardiac functions by anatomically segregated parasympathetic ganglia is discussed. It is argued that the influence of vagal stimulation on ventricular myocardial action potential refractory period, duration, force and rhythm is evidence that vagal fibres have close apposition to myocardial fibres. This is supported by clear evidence of accentuated antagonism between sympathetic activity and vagal activity in the ventricle and also by direct effects of vagal activity independent of sympathetic activity. The idea of differential control of atrial and ventricular physiology by vagal C and vagal B preganglionic fibres is examined as well as differences in chemical phenotypes and their function. The latter is reflected in medullary and supramedullary control. Reference is made to the importance of this knowledge to understanding the normal physiology of cardiac autonomic control and significance to pathology.},

abstract = {The autonomic nervous system plays an important role in the modulation of cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmogenesis. Decades of research has contributed to a better understanding of the anatomy and physiology of cardiac autonomic nervous system and provided evidence supporting the relationship of autonomic tone to clinically significant arrhythmias. The mechanisms by which autonomic activation is arrhythmogenic or antiarrhythmic are complex and different for specific arrhythmias. In atrial fibrillation, simultaneous sympathetic and parasympathetic activations are the most common trigger. In contrast, in ventricular fibrillation in the setting of cardiac ischemia, sympathetic activation is proarrhythmic, whereas parasympathetic activation is antiarrhythmic. In inherited arrhythmia syndromes, sympathetic stimulation precipitates ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death except in Brugada and J-wave syndromes where it can prevent them. The identification of specific autonomic triggers in different arrhythmias has brought the idea of modulating autonomic activities for both preventing and treating these arrhythmias. This has been achieved by either neural ablation or stimulation. Neural modulation as a treatment for arrhythmias has been well established in certain diseases, such as long QT syndrome. However, in most other arrhythmia diseases, it is still an emerging modality and under investigation. Recent preliminary trials have yielded encouraging results. Further larger-scale clinical studies are necessary before widespread application can be recommended.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Physiological Society.Cardiac control is mediated via a series of reflex control networks involving somata in the (i) intrinsic cardiac ganglia (heart), (ii) intrathoracic extracardiac ganglia (stellate, middle cervical), (iii) superior cervical ganglia, (iv) spinal cord, (v) brainstem, and (vi) higher centers. Each of these processing centers contains afferent, efferent, and local circuit neurons, which interact locally and in an interdependent fashion with the other levels to coordinate regional cardiac electrical and mechanical indices on a beat-to-beat basis. This control system is optimized to respond to normal physiological stressors (standing, exercise, and temperature); however, it can be catastrophically disrupted by pathological events such as myocardial ischemia. In fact, it is now recognized that autonomic dysregulation is central to the evolution of heart failure and arrhythmias. Autonomic regulation therapy is an emerging modality in the management of acute and chronic cardiac pathologies. Neuromodulation-based approaches that target select nexus points of this hierarchy for cardiac control offer unique opportunities to positively affect therapeutic outcomes via improved efficacy of cardiovascular reflex control. As such, understanding the anatomical and physiological basis for such control is necessary to implement effectively novel neuromodulation therapies},

The effect of sympathetic stimulation on responses to programmed ventricular stimulation was studied in dogs without myocardial infarction (Group I: n = 5), with transmural anterior wall myocardial infarction (Group II: n = 6) and with nontransmural anterior wall myocardial infarction (Group III: n = 9). Ventricular effective refractory period during sympathetic stimulation decreased by 16 ± 18, 1 ± 2 and 12 ± 8 ms (mean ± SD) in viable muscle of the inferoapical left ventricle in Groups I, II and III, respectively, suggesting efferent sympathetic denervation by transmural myocardial infarction only. Sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation was induced more easily during sympathetic stimulation in six of the six dogs with transmural infarction, but in only two of the nine dogs with nontransmural infarction (p < 0.01). It is concluded that the partial sympathetic denervation produced by transmural myocardial Infarction enhances the ease of induction of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation during sympathetic stimulation. A similar mechanism may lead to increased risk for lethal arrhythmias during periods of high sympathetic tone in patients with transmural myocardial infarction. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {We have previously shown that direct vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) reduces the slope of action potential duration (APD) restitution while simultaneously protecting the heart against induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF) in the absence of any sympathetic activity or tone. In the current study we have examined the role of nitric oxide (NO) in the effect of VNS. Monophasic action potentials were recorded from a left ventricular epicardial site on innervated, isolated rabbit hearts (n = 7). Standard restitution, effective refractory period (ERP) and VF threshold (VFT) were measured at baseline and during VNS in the presence of the NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NA, 200 microm) and during reversing NO blockade with L-arginine (L-Arg, 1 mm). Data represent the mean +/- S.E.M. The restitution curve was shifted upwards and became less steep with VNS when compared to baseline. L-NA blocked the effect of VNS whereas L-Arg restored the effect of VNS. The maximum slope of restitution was reduced from 1.17 +/- 0.14 to 0.60 +/- 0.09 (50 +/- 5%, P < 0.0001) during control, from 0.98 +/- 0.14 to 0.93 +/- 0.12 (2 +/- 10%, P = NS) in the presence of L-NA and from 1.16 +/- 0.17 to 0.50 +/- 0.10 (41 +/- 9%, P = 0.003) with L-Arg plus L-NA. ERP was increased by VNS in control from 119 +/- 6 ms to 130 +/- 6 ms (10 +/- 5%, P = 0.045) and this increase was not affected by L-NA (120 +/- 4 to 133 +/- 4 ms, 11 +/- 3%, P = 0.0019) or L-Arg with L-NA (114 +/- 4 to 123 +/- 4 ms, 8 +/- 2%, P = 0.006). VFT was increased from 3.0 +/- 0.3 to 5.8 +/- 0.5 mA (98 +/- 12%, P = 0.0017) in control, 3.4 +/- 0.4 to 3.8 +/- 0.5 mA (13 +/- 12%, P = 0.6) during perfusion with L-NA and 2.5 +/- 0.4 to 6.0 +/- 0.7 mA (175 +/- 50%, P = 0.0017) during perfusion with L-Arg plus L-NA. Direct VNS increased VFT and flattened the slope of APD restitution curve in this isolated rabbit heart preparation with intact autonomic nerves. These effects were blocked using L-NA and reversed by replenishing the substrate for NO production with L-Arg. This is the first study to demonstrate that NO plays an important role in the anti-fibrillatory effect of VNS on the rabbit ventricle, possibly via effects on APD restitution.},

Vagal stimulation (3 ms; 2.1 +/- 0.7 mA; 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 Hz) was performed while dogs stood on the treadmill (heart rate 120 +/- 25 beats/min) and while they exercised (201 +/- 17 beats/min). Gradual increases of the frequency of vagal stimulation gradually enhanced the inhibitory effect on heart rate both before and during exercise. During exercise, heart rate reduction was significantly greater than that produced at rest at any frequency of stimulation (P less than 0.001). This difference widened as the frequency of stimulation increased and the interaction with or without the presence of exercise was significant (P less than 0.02). Vagal stimulation produced similar effects in the seven dogs without myocardial infarction.

Heart rate was kept constant by pacing the right atrium at cycle lengths of 500 msec. Ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured by delivering 350 msec trains of constant current stimuli with a frequency of 100 hertz and 2 msec duration. The minimal current of the train that induced fibrillation was taken as the ventricular fibrillation threshold. In seven animals, the effects of stellate stimulation were studied. Ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured during control periods, after 2 minutes of coronary occlusion, after 2 minutes of stellate stimulation and after 2 minutes of stellate stimulation and coronary occlusion. Coronary occlusion alone decreased ventricular fibrillation threshold an average of 35 percent of control values and stellate stimulation alone decreased the threshold an average of 42 percent of control values. The combination of both these Interventions decreased ventricular fibrillation threshold an average of 63 percent of control values. The effects of stellate ablation were studied in seven animals. Ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured during control periods, and during coronary occlusion before and after stellate ganglionectomy. Stellectomy increased the threshold an average of 31 percent above control values. After stellectomy, coronary occlusion decreased ventricular fibrillation threshold by only 11 percent of control values, a value 26 percent higher than the threshold during coronary occlusion before stellectomy. These findings may have therapeutic implications for the management of arrhythmias in patients with acute myocardial infarction or some forms of central nervous system disease. {\textcopyright} 1975.},

abstract = {I HAVE already described on various occasions [1] [2] the effect of small doses of adrenalin upon the mammalian heart under chloroform. When the heart is affected by low concentrations of chloroform it is thrown by the action of adrenalin into a condition known as ventricular fibrillation, but when affected by full concentrations, such, for instance, as a 2 per cent. proportion of vapour to the inhaled 'air, ventricular fibrillation does not occur. What I have to say tonight is but the logical sequence of this principle. EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE HEART AFFECTED BY CHLOROFORM. What is ventricular fibrillation? Let me say at once that we have not at present a distinct conception of its intimate nature, but we are aware that ineffectual ventricular contractions succeed one another at a very rapid rate, and the function of the ventricles is entirely abolished; its clinical manifestation is therefore a sudden vascular collapse, and consequent instantaneous death. In the lower mammals fibrillation is generally a permanent condition, but in exceptional cases spontaneous recovery of the heart takes place. In the human subject (judging by the accounts of syncope resulting from-the injections of adrenalin under chloroform) recovery from fibrillation is of not infrequent occurrence. Despite the opinion, expressed some years ago by Professor McWilliam, that it might be found to explain sudden death in some JU-1},

abstract = {The effect of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) upon ventricular vulnerability was studied in 30 mongrel dogs subjected to varying levels of adrenergic stimulation. Vulnerability was assessed both by determining the minimum current required to produce ventricular fibrillation (VF threshold) and by plotting VF threshold throughout the vulnerable period (VF zone). Chloralose-anesthetized animals were studied by means of sequential pulses applied to the apex of the right ventricular endocardium. Testing was carried out in closed-chest dogs, in open-chest dogs with and without left stellate ganglion stimulation (LSGS), and in open-and closed-chest dogs pretreated with propranolol. In the absence of adrenergic stimulation, VNS was without significant effect on either the VF threshold or the VF zone under closed-or open-chest conditions. During LSGS, however, VNS was associated with a 93 ± 22% (mean SE) increase in VF threshold (P < 0.01) and constriction of the VF zone. Vagus nerve stimulation combined with LSGS raised VF threshold to the control value, but not beyond. After beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol, VNS was without effect on VF threshold in either open-or closed-chest animals. It is concluded that augmented sympathetic tone is a precondition for a VNS-induced elevation in VF threshold. The vagal effect is indirect and is expressed by opposing the effects of heightened adrenergic tone on ventricular vulnerability. IN THEIR CLASSIC STUDIES on cardiac ex-citability, Hoffman, Brooks, and co-workers1-4 found that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) was without significant effect on the electrical properties of the ventricle. Evidence to the contrary has recently been provided by Kent and Harrison et al.5' 6 When the ventricular fibrillation (VF) threshold was determined by means of a train of electrical pulses closely coupled to an antecedent paced beat, it was found that both VNS5 and edrophonium chloride" consistently raised VF threshold in the normal as well as the ischemic canine ventricle. The protection against fibrillation was independent of vagally-mediated bradycardia. Preliminary experiments by our group7 appeared to support the traditional view: we found that VNS had no effect on ventricular vulnerability in the non-ischemic heart. Furthermore, in animals subjected to beta-adrenergic blockade, hypothalamic stimulation,8 and reflex vagal activation by means of blood pressure elevation9 were without effect on VF threshold. In intact animals, parasympathetic discharge does not occur in isolation, but rather concomitantly with activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Vagal effects on such inotropic and chronotropic parameters as sinus rate of the intact heart'0 or contractile force of the isovolumic canine ventricle" are considerably influenced by the level of prevailing adrenergic tone. It may be that differing degrees of interaction between the two components of the autonomic nervous system account for the disparate findings as tothe role of vagal stimulation on ventricular vulnerability. To test whether this is indeed the case, the present studies were conducted under conditions which corresponded to varying levels of adrenergic input: in closed-chest dogs, in open-chest dogs, in open-chest dogs during continuous supramaximal left stellate ganglion stimulation (LSGS), and finally in both closed-and open-chest dogs subjected to acute beta-adrenergic blockade. In these experiments, both quantitative and qualitative appraisal of susceptibility to induce VF was made possible by determining the overall temporal configuration of vulnerability, as well as the VF threshold. Material and Methods Thirty healthy mongrel dogs, weighing 7-25 kg, were studied. The animals were anesthetized with i.v. administration of brevital (5 mg/kg), followed by 100 mg/kg alpha-chloralose. Additional booster doses of 50 mg/kg alpha-chloralose were given as required; a minimum of 30 min},

abstract = {We evaluated a method of baroreflex testing involving sequential intravenous bolus injections of nitroprusside followed by phenylephrine and phenylephrine followed by nitroprusside in 18 healthy men and women, and we drew inferences regarding human sympathetic and vagal baroreflex mechanisms. We recorded the electrocardiogram, photoplethysmographic finger arterial pressure, and peroneal nerve muscle sympathetic activity. We then contrasted least squares linear regression slopes derived from the depressor (nitroprusside) and pressor (phenylephrine) phases with 1) slopes derived from spontaneous fluctuations of systolic arterial pressures and R-R intervals, and 2) baroreflex gain derived from cross-spectral analyses of systolic pressures and R-R intervals. We calculated sympathetic baroreflex gain from integrated muscle sympathetic nerve activity and diastolic pressures. We found that vagal baroreflex slopes are less when arterial pressures are falling than when they are rising and that this hysteresis exists over pressure ranges both below and above baseline levels. Although pharmacological and spontaneous vagal baroreflex responses correlate closely, pharmacological baroreflex slopes tend to be lower than those derived from spontaneous fluctuations. Sympathetic baroreflex slopes are similar when arterial pressure is falling and rising; however, small pressure elevations above baseline silence sympathetic motoneurons. Vagal, but not sympathetic baroreflex gains vary inversely with subjects' ages and their baseline arterial pressures. There is no correlation between sympathetic and vagal baroreflex gains. We recommend repeated sequential nitroprusside followed by phenylephrine doses as a simple, efficientmeans to provoke and characterize human vagal and sympathetic baroreflex responses.},

abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The understanding of the risk factors for CVD may yield important insights into the prevention, etiology, course, and treatment of this major public health concern. Autonomic imbalance, characterized by a hyperactive sympathetic system and a hypoactive parasympathetic system, is associated with various pathological conditions. Over time, excessive energy demands on the system can lead to premature aging and diseases. Therefore, autonomic imbalance may be a final common pathway to increased morbidity and mortality from a host of conditions and diseases, including cardiovascular disease. Heart rate variability (HRV) may be used to assess autonomic imbalances, diseases and mortality. Parasympathetic activity and HRV have been associated with a wide range of conditions including CVD. Here we review the evidence linking HRV to established and emerging modifiable and non-modifiable CVD risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, family history and work stress. Substantial evidence exists to support the notion that decreased HRV precedes the development of a number of risk factors and that lowering risk profiles is associated with increased HRV. We close with a suggestion that a model of autonomic imbalance may provide a unifying framework within which to investigate the impact of risk factors, including psychosocial factors and work stress, on cardiovascular disease. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {1. The electrophysiological properties of intracardiac neurones cultured from ganglia within the atria and interatrial septum of the new-born guinea-pig heart were studied using intracellular micro-electrodes. 2. Three types of neurones with resting membrane potentials in the range -45 to -76 mV were detected. The first type, AHs cells, had high (15-28 mV) firing thresholds, pronounced slow post-spike after-hyperpolarizations and fired only once to prolonged intrasomal current injection. The second type, AHm cells, were similar to AHs cells, except that they could fire short bursts of spikes (100-400 ms) at the onset of current injection. The third type, M cells, had low firing thresholds (10-15 mV), no slow after-hyperpolarizations and produced non-adapting trains of action potentials in response to depolarizing current injection. 3. The generation of action potentials in M cells was prevented by tetrodotoxin (TTX; 0.3 microM), whereas in AHs and AHm cells action potentials displayed a channel blockade using solutions containing the divalent cations cadmium, cobalt or manganese (0.02-1 mM). 4. The post-spike after-hyperpolarization in AHs and AHm cells was abolished by the removal of extracellular calcium, shortened in solutions containing the calcium entry blockers CdCl2, MnSO4 and CoCl2 (0.02-1 mM) and prolonged by the addition of calcium (5.0 mM), tetraethylammonium (1-3 mM), 4-aminopyridine (1-3 mM), cyanide (10 microM) or caffeine (100 microM) to the perfusate. 5. The reversal potential of the post-spike after-hyperpolarization was -89.1 mV. This value changed by 62.9 mV for a 10-fold increase in extracellular potassium concentration. 6. The peak conductance change during the post-spike after-hyperpolarization (gK,Ca), was largely independent of membrane potential between -50 and -110 mV. The peak increase in gK,Ca and the duration of the after-hyperpolarization increased with the number of spikes preceding it. 7. It is concluded that calcium entry during the action potential is responsible for the activation of an outward potassium current in the two types of AH cells; the roles played by intracellular calcium extrusion as well as sequestration mechanisms in the generation of the response are discussed.},

VF threshold was determined by inducing a sequence of early extrasystoles (R/T pulsing). Hypothalamic stimulation was associated with sinus tachycardia, systemic hypertension, and a 40% reduction in VF threshold. The effects of hypothalamic stimulation on the VF threshold persisted when heart rate acceleration and the pressor response were prevented. Cervical vagotomy and bilateral adrenalectomy were likewise without effect on fibrillation threshold changes. However, the decrease in threshold was abolished by beta adrenergic blockade.

abstract = {Background. Experimental evidence suggests that autonomic markers such as heart-rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) may contribute to post-infarction risk stratification. There are clinical data to support this concept for heart-rate variability. The main objective of the ATRAMI study was to provide prospective data on the additional and independent prognostic value for cardiac mortality of heart-rate variability and BRS in patients after myocardial infarction in whom left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and ventricular arrhythmias were known. Methods. This multicentre international prospective study enrolled 1284 patients with a recent (< 28 days) myocardial infarction, 24 h Holter recording was done to quantify heart-rate variability (measured as standard deviation of normal to normal RR intervals [SDNN]) and ventricular arrhythmias. BRS was calculated from measurement of the rate-pressure response to intravenous phenylephrine. Findings. During 21 (SD 8) months of follow-up, the primary endpoint, cardiac mortality, included 44 cardiac deaths and five non-fatal cardiac arrests. Low values of either heart-rate variability (SDNN < 70 ms) or BRS (< 3.0 ms per mmHg) carried a significant multivariate risk of cardiac mortality (3.2 [95% CI 1.42-7.36] and 2.8 [1.24-6.16], respectively). The association of low SDNN and BRS further increased risk; the 2-year mortality was 17% when both were below the cut-offs and 2% (p < 0.0001) when both were well preserved (SDNN > 105 ms, BRS > 6.1 ms per mmHg). The association of low SDNN or BRS with LVEF below 35% carried a relative risk of 6.7 (3.1-14.6) or 8.7 (4.3-17.6), respectively, compared with patients with LVEF above 35% and less compromised SDNN ≤ 70 ms) and BRS (≤ 3 ms per mmHg). Interpretation. ATRAMI provides clinical evidence that after myocardial infarction the analysis of vagal reflexes has significant prognostic value independently of LVEF and of ventricular arrhythmias acid that it significantly adds to the prognostic value of heart-rate variability.},

abstract = {Major untoward events, such as life-threatening arrhythmias and acute coronary events, have been suggested to be triggered by the activation of the autonomic nervous system in patients with coronary artery disease. Analysis of heart rate variability by conventional time and frequency domain methods, as well as by newer methods derived from nonlinear system theory, has offered a novel approach for studying the abnormalities in cardiovascular neural regulation in ischemic heart disease. Heart rate variability has been shown to be altered among patients with ischemic heart disease as compared to their age-matched controls without the evidence of ischemic heart disease. There are also obvious differences in various measures of heart rate variability between patients with uncomplicated coronary artery disease and those with coronary artery disease with complicated myocardial infarction. Impaired high-frequency oscillations of heart rate is the most prominent feature in patients with uncomplicated coronary artery disease, suggesting mainly an impairment in vagal autonomic regulation. Patients with prior myocardial infarction have a reduced overall heart rate variability, and a specific spectral pattern with a reduced low-frequency spectral component has been observed in patients with prior myocardial infarction and impaired left ventricular function. Recent studies have shown that the new nonlinear measures, particularly fractal analysis methods of heart rate dynamics, can detect subtle changes in heart rate behavior that are not easily detected by traditional analysis methods from ambulatory recordings. Patients with prior myocardial infarction have steeper power-law slope analyzed from the ultra and very low-frequency spectral bands, and they also have more random short-term heart rate dynamics analyzed by the detrended fluctuation method. A large body of data indicate that reduced overall heart rate variability is associated with an increased risk of mortality and nonfatal cardiac events in patient with ischemic heart disease. Of particular note, recent studies indicate that fractal analysis methods perform even better than the traditional analysis methods of heart rate variability as predictors of death and the onset of life-threatening arrhythmic events in post-infarction populations. These findings support the notion that heart rate variability analysis methods, such as fractal and complexity measures as well as conventional techniques, give valuable clinical information among patients with ischemic heart disease.

abstract = {Heart failure is a syndrome characterized initially by left ventricular dysfunction that triggers countermeasures aimed to restore cardiac output. These responses are compensatory at first but eventually become part of the disease process itself leading to further worsening cardiac function. Among these responses is the activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) that provides inotropic support to the failing heart increasing stroke volume, and peripheral vasoconstriction to maintain mean arterial perfusion pressure, but eventually accelerates disease progression affecting survival. Activation of SNS has been attributed to withdrawal of normal restraining influences and enhancement of excitatory inputs including changes in: 1) peripheral baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflexes; 2) chemical mediators that control sympathetic outflow; and 3) central integratory sites. The interface between the sympathetic fibers and the cardiovascular system is formed by the adrenergic receptors (ARs). Dysregulation of cardiac beta1-AR signaling and transduction are key features of heart failure progression. In contrast, cardiac beta2-ARs and alpha1-ARs may function in a compensatory fashion to maintain cardiac inotropy. Adrenergic receptor polymorphisms may have an impact on the adaptive mechanisms, susceptibilities, and pharmacological responses of SNS. The beta-AR blockers and the inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis form the mainstay of current medical management of chronic heart failure. Conversely, central sympatholytics have proved harmful, whereas sympathomimetic inotropes are still used in selected patients with hemodynamic instability. This review summarizes the changes in SNS in heart failure and examines how modulation of SNS activity may affect morbidity and mortality from this syndrome. {\textcopyright} 2009 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED We studied the relationship between myocardial [123I]metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) uptake and autonomic nerve activity in normal subjects. METHODS MIBG scintigraphy and power spectral analysis (PSA) of heart rate variability were performed simultaneously in 15 normal subjects. Anterior planar images and SPECT images were taken at five and two points after the injection of [123I]MIBG, respectively. In 10 of 15 subjects, 201TI myocardial SPECT was performed immediately after MIBG scintigraphy. RESULTS The heart/upper mediastinum MIBG uptake ratio in the planar image obtained at 240 min (r = 0.64, p < 0.01) and the washout rate of MIBG in the heart between 15 min and 240 min (r = 0.51, p < 0.05) showed significant correlation with the percentage of low frequency component of PSA (percent LF), an index of sympathetic nerve activity. Regional MIBG uptake in the inferior wall normalized by individual maximal uptake among all pixels was significantly correlated with the high frequency component of PSA, an index of parasympathetic nerve activity (r = -0.58, p < 0.05) and with mean R-R interval in a resting ECG (r = -0.82, p < 0.001) but did not correlate with percent LF, percent uptake of 201TI in the inferior wall or the liver/heart uptake ratio. CONCLUSION These results indicate that myocardial MIBG uptake correlates with sympathetic nerve activity in normal subjects. Our data indicate that heterogeneous MIBG distribution in the left ventricle is a physiologic rather than artifactual phenomenon and may be related to vagal tone rather than sympathetic nerve activity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Measures of baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate variability (HRV), and the classical Ewing test parameters are currently used for the diagnosis of diabetic autonomic neuropathy and for mortality risk stratification after myocardial infarction. However, the strengths of the associations of these measures of autonomic function with risk of mortality have never been compared in one study population. Furthermore, no evidence is available on the possible effect of glucose tolerance on these associations. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study population (n = 605) consisted of a glucose tolerance-stratified sample from a general population (50-75 years of age). Cardiac cycle duration and continuous finger arterial pressure were measured under two conditions: at rest and on metronome breathing. From these readings, seven parameters of autonomic function were assessed (one Ewing, five HRV, and one baroreflex sensitivity). RESULTS: During 9 years of follow-up, 101 individuals died, 43 from cardiovascular causes. Subjects with diabetes and low levels of the autonomic function parameters, indicating impaired autonomic function, had an approximately doubled risk of mortality. This association was consistent, though not statistically significant, for all parameters. The elevated risk was not observed in subjects without diabetes, hypertension, or prevalent cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired autonomic function is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Moreover, the results of the present study suggest that cardiac autonomic dysfunction in patients already at risk (diabetes, hypertension, or history of cardiovascular disease) may be especially hazardous.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute inferior myocardial infarction (MI) often induces transient sinus bradycardia through vagal enhancement, known as Bezold-Jarisch reflex, which is explained by preferential distribution of vagal nerve in the inferior wall. We examined vagal activity in relation to the occurrence of residual ischemia in patients with old inferior MI and assessed its diagnostic usefulness. METHODS: Exercise myocardial scintigraphy was performed in 15 patients with old inferior MI, 19 angina pectoris (AP) patients with inferior ischemia but no MI, and 32 control subjects who had no evidence of cardiac disease. We analyzed the connection of residual ischemia in old MI with ST-segment response to exercise and with vagal activity as determined by coefficient of component variance of high frequency (CCV(HF)). RESULTS: Exercise-induced percentage change in CCV(HF) was higher in patients with old MI and residual ischemia (18.8 +/- 13.5%) and AP (5.5 +/- 9.7%) than old MI but no residual ischemia (-24.1 +/- 4.9%) or control (-22.8 +/- 4.5%, P = 0.006). Percentage change in CCV(HF) > -5% had a good diagnostic value for the detection of residual ischemia in patients with old inferior MI with sensitivity of 83%, specificity of 89%, accuracy of 87%, and positive likelihood ratio of 7.50, which was higher than that of ST-segment depression (67%, 50%, 56%, and 1.33). CONCLUSIONS: Vagal enhancement was associated with residual ischemia in old inferior MI as well as inferior AP. Measurement of CCV(HF) is useful in improving the diagnostic reliability of exercise electrocardiography in patients with old inferior MI.},

It describes recent human brain imaging studies that relate activity in these brain circuits to emotional processes, peripheral physiology, preclinical pathophysiology, as well as clinical outcomes. Recent Findings Negative emotions and the regulation of negative emotions reliably engage several brain regions that cross-sectional and longitudinal brain imaging studies have associated with CVD risk markers and outcomes. These brain regions include the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and insula. Other studies have applied advanced statistical techniques to characterize multivariate patterns of brain activity and brain connectivity that associate with negative emotion and CVD-relevant peripheral physiology. Summary Brain imaging studies on emotion and cardiovascular disease risk are expanding our understanding of the brain-body bases of psychosocial and behavioral risk for cardiovascular disease.},

The disease is characterised by autonomic imbalance with increased sympathetic activity and withdrawal of parasympathetic activity. Despite the use of medical therapies that target, in part, the neurohormonal axis, rates of HF progression, morbidity and mortality remain high. Emerging therapies centred on neuromodulation of autonomic control of the heart provide an alternative device-based approach to restoring sympathovagal balance.

This article highlights the importance of understanding structural/functional organisation of the cardiac nervous system as mechanistic-based neuromodulation therapies evolve.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the relative magnitudes of the reflex effects mediated by sensory endings in the left ventricle activated by intracoronary injection of nicotine or veratridine into left anterior descending (LAD) or circumflex (Cx) coronary arteries in the dog. Injection of nicotine or veratridine into the Cx consistently resulted in larger decreases in heart rate, arterial pressure, and in gracilis perfusion pressure than were observed following injection of the same dose into the LAD. Vagotomy abolished the cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor responses to intracoronary nicotine or veratridine. The weight of left ventricle perfused by LAD or Cx was not different (43.5 +/- 1.65 and 44.5 +/- 2.2 g, respectively. These data indicate that chemical activation of sensory endings with vagal afferents in the inferoposterior left ventricle of the dog results in larger cardionhibitor and vasodepressor responses than result from activation of respects in the anterior left ventricle. Further, these data provide strong evidence that these sensory endings which are chemically activated are preferentially distributed to the inferoposterior left ventricle.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Intensive therapy targeting normal blood glucose increased mortality compared with standard treatment in a randomized clinical trial of 10,251 participants with type 2 diabetes at high-risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. We evaluated whether the presence of cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) at baseline modified the effect of intensive compared with standard glycemia treatment on mortality outcomes in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial participants.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: CAN was assessed by measures of heart rate variability (HRV) and QT index (QTI) computed from 10-s resting electrocardiograms in 8,135 ACCORD trial participants with valid measurements (mean age 63.0 years, 40% women). Prespecified CAN definitions included a composite of the lowest quartile of HRV and highest QTI quartile in the presence or absence of peripheral neuropathy. Outcomes were all-cause and CVD mortality. Associations between CAN and mortality were evaluated by proportional hazards analysis, adjusting for treatment group allocation, CVD history, and multiple prespecified baseline covariates.\nRESULTS: During a mean 3.5 years follow-up, there were 329 deaths from all causes. In fully adjusted analyses, participants with baseline CAN were 1.55-2.14 times as likely to die as participants without CAN, depending on the CAN definition used (P < 0.02 for all). The effect of allocation to the intensive group on all-cause and CVD mortality was similar in participants with or without CAN at baseline (P(interaction) > 0.7).\nCONCLUSIONS: Whereas CAN was associated with increased mortality in this high-risk type 2 diabetes cohort, these analyses indicate that participants with CAN at baseline had similar mortality outcomes from intensive compared with standard glycemia treatment in the ACCORD cohort.},

abstract = {Objectives The purpose of this study was to investigate the independent association between global cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in addition to regional associations of LV dysinnervation and function, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Background CAN represents a potential mechanism in the etiology of nonischemic diabetic cardiomyopathy. Methods Clinical measures of CAN based on total spectral power of heart rate variability and cardiac reflex testing and echocardiographic assessment of LV function were performed in 118 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Systolic and diastolic function were defined at rest and peak exercise using peak systolic and peak early diastolic (Em) tissue velocities, calculated in 6 basal- and mid-segments using color tissue Doppler. Iodine 123-metaiodobenzylguanidine imaging was performed in 33 patients to directly quantify global (heart/mediastinum ratio) and regional LV sympathetic integrity. Results Patients with CAN demonstrated higher resting heart rate, systolic and mean blood pressures, aortic stiffness, hemoglobin A1c, and urine albumin/creatinine ratio, in addition to lower peak heart rate, chronotropic index, and exercise capacity. Diastolic function (Em) was associated with CAN, evidenced by total spectral power (r = 0.42, p < 0.001) and heart/mediastinum ratio (r = 0.41, p = 0.017). Diastolic function (Em) at rest and systolic function (peak systolic tissue velocity) at rest and exercise were significantly reduced in patients with CAN. Furthermore, total spectral power was associated with Em independent of age, hypertension, metabolic factors, and other relevant contributors to LV dysfunction ($\beta$ = 0.20, p = 0.035). Relative regional tracer deficits indicative of local denervation were predominant in the anterior and lateral walls (p < 0.001). Associations with regional Em, independent of global iodine 123-metaiodobenzylguanidine uptake, were identified exclusively in mid-anterior ($\beta$ = 0.45, p = 0.01) and mid-lateral walls ($\beta$ = 0.34, p = 0.03). However, no association was found between regional denervation and systolic or diastolic dyssynchrony. Conclusions The diastolic dysfunction of type 2 diabetes mellitus shows associations with both regional markers of sympathetic integrity and clinical markers of autonomic neuropathy. {\textcopyright} 2010 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine the capacity of nodose ganglion afferent neurones with epicardial sensory endings to respond to mechanical and chemical stimuli, in particular to purinergic compounds.\n\nMETHODS: Alterations in spontaneous activity generated by epicardial afferent neurones in nodose ganglia in situ of 17 anaesthetised dogs were identified using extracellular recording techniques when mechanical and chemical stimuli were applied to their receptor fields, as well as during brief periods of coronary artery occlusion.\n\nRESULTS: 92 cardiac afferent neurones were identified. Localised epicardial distortion modified the activity generated by 34 neurones [0.19(SEM 0.02) to 1.2(0.4) impulses.s-1]. Application of bradykinin, substance P, N6-cyclopentyladenosine or beta, gamma-methylene adenosine 5'-triphosphate to localised epicardial fields altered the activity of 69 neurones. Thus the majority of identified epicardial neurones responded to chemical stimuli alone (63%) as opposed to mechanical stimuli alone (25%), 12% responding to both types of stimuli. Activity was enhanced overall by chemical stimuli from a mean range of 0.1-0.4 to 11.6-13.2 impulses.s-1. Following termination of short lasting chemical as opposed to mechanical stimuli, activity remained increased for up to 45 min. Activity generated by 16 chemosensitive neurones was modified by brief periods of coronary artery occlusion [0.26(0.12)-1.66(0.61) impulses.s-1]; activity increasing further [2.51(0.47) impulses.s-1] during reperfusion periods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: (1) Chemical stimuli induce an order magnitude greater enhancement of activity generated by nodose ganglion cardiac afferent neurones than do mechanical stimuli, such enhancement persisting long after removal of chemical as opposed to mechanical stimuli. Thus qualitative and quantitative differences exists between central neuronal inputs derived from nodose ganglion epicardial afferent neurones sensitive to chemical as opposed to mechanical stimuli. (2) Adenosine and ATP can activate nodose ganglion cardiac afferent neurones.},

abstract = {AIMS: The role of the vagus in the ventricle is controversial, although the vagus can protect against ventricular fibrillation (VF) via nitric oxide (NO). This study aims to determine whether the mechanisms involved are dependent on post-ganglionic release and muscarinic receptor activation. For this purpose, NO release and electrophysiological effects of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) were evaluated in relation to acetylcholine and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). In addition, the role of the coronary endothelium and afferent nerves was tested.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Using the isolated innervated rabbit heart, we measured ventricular NO release using 4,5-diaminofluorescein (DAF-2) fluorescence and ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) during VNS after muscarinic, ganglionic, and VIP inhibition [atropine, hexamethonium, and VIP (6-28), respectively] and after Triton-X endothelial functional dysfunction. The vagal-mediated increases in NO and VFT were not significantly affected (P> 0.05) during (i) atropine perfusion [increase in NO: 196.8 ± 35.2 mV (control) vs. 156.1 ± 20.3 mV (atropine) and VFT 3.1 ± 0.5 mA (control) vs. 2.7 ± 0.4 mA (atropine)], (ii) VIP inhibition-increase in NO: 243.0 ± 42.4 mV (control) vs. 203.9 ± 28.5 mV [VIP(6-28)] and VFT 3.3 ± 0.3 mA (control) vs. 3.9 ± 0.6 mA [VIP(6-28)], or (iii) after endothelial functional dysfunction [increase in NO: 127.7 ± 31.7 mV (control) vs. 172.1 ± 31.5 mV (Triton-X) and VFT 2.6 ± 0.4 mA (control) vs. 2.5 ± 0.5 mA (Triton-X)]. However, the vagal effects were inhibited during ganglionic blockade [increase in NO: 175.1 ± 38.1 mV (control) vs. 0.6 ± 25.3 mV (hexamethonium) and VFT 3.3 ± 0.5 mA (control) vs. -0.3 ± 0.3 mA (hexamethonium)].\n\nCONCLUSIONS: We show that the vagal anti-fibrillatory action in the rabbit ventricle occurs via post-ganglionic efferent nerve fibres, independent of muscarinic receptor activation, VIP, and the endothelium. Together with our previous publications, our data support the possibility of a novel ventricular nitrergic parasympathetic innervation and highlight potential for new therapeutic targets to treat ventricular dysrhythmias.},

abstract = {In the present paper we present the outlines of a model that integrates autonomic, attentional, and affective systems into a functional and structural network that may help to guide us in our understanding of emotion regulation and dysregulation. We will emphasize the relationship between attentional regulation and affective processes and propose a group of underlying physiological systems that serve to integrate these functions in the service of self-regulation and adaptability of the organism. We will attempt to place this network in the context of dynamical systems models which involve feedback and feedforward circuits with special attention to negative feedback mechanisms, inhibitory processes, and their role in response selection. From a systems perspective, inhibitory processes can be viewed as negative feedback circuits that allow for the interruption of ongoing behavior and the re-deployment of resources to other tasks. When these negative feedback mechanisms are compromised, positive feedback loops may develop as a result (of dis-inhibition). From this perspective, the relative sympathetic activation seen in anxiety disorders may represent dis-inhibition due to faulty inhibitory mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {It is hypothesized that the heart possesses a nervous system intrinsic to it that represents the final relay station for the co-ordination of regional cardiac indices. This 'little brain' on the heart is comprised of spatially distributed sensory (afferent), interconnecting (local circuit) and motor (adrenergic and cholinergic efferent) neurones that communicate with others in intrathoracic extracardiac ganglia, all under the tonic influence of central neuronal command and circulating catecholamines. Neurones residing from the level of the heart to the insular cortex form temporally dependent reflexes that control overlapping, spatially determined cardiac indices. The emergent properties that most of its components display depend primarily on sensory transduction of the cardiovascular milieu. It is further hypothesized that the stochastic nature of such neuronal interactions represents a stabilizing feature that matches cardiac output to normal corporal blood flow demands. Thus, with regard to cardiac disease states, one must consider not only cardiac myocyte dysfunction but also the fact that components within this neuroaxis may interact abnormally to alter myocyte function. This review emphasizes the stochastic behaviour displayed by most peripheral cardiac neurones, which appears to be a consequence of their predominant cardiac chemosensory inputs, as well as their complex functional interconnectivity. Despite our limited understanding of the whole, current data indicate that the emergent properties displayed by most neurones comprising the cardiac neuroaxis will have to be taken into consideration when contemplating the targeting of its individual components if predictable, long-term therapeutic benefits are to accrue.},

abstract = {The precise mechanism of the vagus in opposing adrenergic influences on cardiac vulnerability has not been defined. In the present investigation, cholinergic stimulation was produced by administering the selective muscarinic agent methacholine (MCh) and ventricular vulnerability was assessed by measuring the repetitive extrasystole (RE) threshold. MCh produced a sustained 98 +/- 12% (P less than 0.0001) increase in the RE threshold; the increase was abolished by concurrent infusion of atropine (0.2 mg/kg). When MCh was administered during beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol, however, no further increase in RE threshold occurred beyond that resulting from propranolol alone. Infusion of norepinephrine (NE), in a dose insufficient to provoke systemic hypertension, significantly lowered the vulnerable period threshold. This decrease was completely abolished by concurrent vagosympathetic stimulation (VS). It is concluded that VS affects ventricular vulnerability through its muscarinic action and that the protection against VF is in part due to modulation of neural and humoral beta-adrenergic inputs.},

abstract = {A hallmark of cardiovascular disease is cardiac autonomic dysregulation. The phenotype of impaired parasympathetic responsiveness and sympathetic hyperactivity in experimental animal models is also well documented in large scale human studies in the setting of heart failure and myocardial infarction, and is predictive of morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in emergency revascularisation strategies for myocardial infarction, device therapy for heart failure and secondary prevention pharmacotherapies, mortality from malignant ventricular arrhythmia remains high. Patients at highest risk or those with haemodynamically significant ventricular arrhythmia can be treated with catheter ablation and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, but the morbidity and reduction in quality of life due to the burden of ventricular arrhythmia and shock therapy persists. Therefore, future therapies must aim to target the underlying pathophysiology that contributes to the generation of ventricular arrhythmia. This review explores recent advances in mechanistic research in both limbs of the autonomic nervous system and potential avenues for translation into clinical therapy. In addition, we also discuss the relationship of these findings in the context of the reported efficacy of current neuromodulatory strategies in the management of ventricular arrhythmia.},

Although it is clear that central command, the exercise pressor reflex and the arterial baroreflex are all requisite for eliciting appropriate cardiovascular adjustments to exercise, this review will be limited primarily to discussion of central command. Central modulation of the cardiovascular system via descending signals from higher brain centres has been well recognized for over a century, yet the specific regions of the human brain involved in this exercise-related response have remained speculative. Brain mapping studies during exercise as well as non-exercise conditions have provided information towards establishing the cerebral cortical structures in the human brain specifically involved in cardiovascular control. The purpose of this review is to provide an update of current concepts on central command in humans, with a particular emphasis on the regions of the brain identified to alter autonomic outflow and result in cardiovascular adjustments.},

abstract = {The intrinsic cardiac nervous system has been classically considered to contain only parasympathetic efferent postganglionic neurones which receive inputs from medullary parasympathetic efferent preganglionic neurones. In such a view, intrinsic cardiac ganglia act as simple relay stations of parasympathetic efferent neuronal input to the heart, the major autonomic control of the heart purported to reside solely in the brainstem and spinal cord. Data collected over the past two decades indicate that processing occurs within the mammalian intrinsic cardiac nervous system which involves afferent neurones, local circuit neurones (interconnecting neurones) as well as both sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent postganglionic neurones. As such, intrinsic cardiac ganglionic interactions represent the organ component of the hierarchy of intrathoracic nested feedback control loops which provide rapid and appropriate reflex coordination of efferent autonomic neuronal outflow to the heart. In such a concept, the intrinsic cardiac nervous system acts as a distributive processor, integrating parasympathetic and sympathetic efferent centrifugal information to the heart in addition to centripetal information arising from cardiac sensory neurites. A number of neurochemicals have been shown to influence the interneuronal interactions which occur within the intrathoracic cardiac nervous system. For instance, pharmacological interventions that modify b-adrenergic or angiotensin II receptors affect cardiomyocyte function not only directly, but indirectly by influencing the capacity of intrathoracic neurones to regulate cardiomyocytes. Thus, current pharmacological management of heart disease may influence cardiomyocyte function directly as well as indirectly secondary to modifying the cardiac nervous system. This review presents a brief summary of developing concepts about the role of the cardiac nervous system in regulating the normal heart. In addition, it provides some tentative ideas concerning the importance of this nervous system in cardiac disease states with a view to stimulating further interest in neural control of the heart so that appropriate neurocardiological strategies can be devised for the management of heart disease.},

Spectral density plots in intact animals showed three well-defined peaks: P1 (1.5-2.5 cycles/min), P2 (6-10 cycles/min), and P2 (respiratory frequency). In the presence of sympathetic input only the amplitudes of all peaks were decreased; when only vagal input was present the amplitudes of P1 and P2 were increased and there was no change in P3; when neither sympathetic nor vagal input was present the amplitudes of all peaks were decreased. In addition, the amplitudes of P1 and P2 were increased and there was no change in P3; when neither sympathetic nor vagal input was present the amplitudes of all peaks were decreased. In addition, the amplitudes of P1 and P2 were found to be significantly correlated with the mean heart period under the condition of vagal control only. It is concluded that P3 is related to sinus arrhythmia and that P1 and P2 may be related to spontaneous rhythms that are an intrinsic feature of the dynamic regulation of heart period by the vagus system. Sympathetic activity plays no role in the genesis of these rhythms.},

abstract = {The renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the regulation of arterial blood pressure and in the development of some forms of clinical and experimental hypertension. It is an important blood pressure control system in its own right but also interacts extensively with other blood pressure control systems, including the sympathetic nervous system and the baroreceptor reflexes. Angiotensin (ANG) II exerts several actions on the sympathetic nervous system. These include a central action to increase sympathetic outflow, stimulatory effects on sympathetic ganglia and the adrenal medulla, and actions at sympathetic nerve endings that serve to facilitate sympathetic neurotransmission. ANG II also interacts with baroreceptor reflexes. For example, it acts centrally to modulate the baroreflex control of heart rate, and this accounts for its ability to increase blood pressure without causing a reflex bradycardia. The physiological significance of these actions of ANG II is not fully understood. Most evidence indicates that the actions of ANG to enhance sympathetic activity do not contribute significantly to the pressor response to exogenous ANG II. On the other hand, there is considerable evidence that the actions of endogenous ANG II on the sympathetic nervous system enhance the cardiovascular responses elicited by activation of the sympathetic nervous system.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute mental stress evokes responses in the cardiovascular and the immune systems. In particular, the subset of natural killer (NK) cells is found to be responsive to mental stress. The role of beta-adrenergic mechanisms in these processes in the subject of this investigation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Healthy male volunteers (n = 31) were subjected to two consecutive mental tasks. Subjects were randomly assigned to a beta-blocker (propranolol 40 mg) or a placebo group. The capsules were ingested 1 hour before the tasks. The tasks evoked sympathetic responses, as indicated by an increase in heart rate and a decrease in the preejection period. These effects were abolished under beta-blockade, indicating that effective beta-blockade was achieved. In the immune system, significant increases were found for the number of NK cells and NK cell activity in the placebo group; these increases were absent in the propranolol group. In addition, an increase in all lymphocyte subsets was observed in subjects who had ingested propranolol. This increase, however, was also observed in subjects who had received propranolol but had not performed the tasks, indicating that these non-subset-specific increases in lymphocytes were a side effect of the beta-blocker. CONCLUSIONS: Mental stress induces activation of the sympathetic nervous system, with concomitant increases in the number of NK cells in the circulation. These changes were inhibited by propranolol, indicating that stress-induced increases in the number and activity of NK cells in the circulation are controlled by a beta-adrenergic mechanism.},

abstract = {91284342 Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia/Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond BACKGROUND. Left ventricular sympathetic afferent nerves are located mainly in superficial epicardial layers. Reflex excitatory responses mediated by sympathetic afferent nerves have been observed during myocardial ischemia in cats and humans but not in dogs. Previous canine studies have induced ischemia by occlusion of a coronary artery. Extensive collateral circulation in the canine heart may limit ischemia of epicardial layers during simple coronary occlusion, resulting in little stimulation of sympathetic afferent nerves and minimal reflex excitatory responses. METHODS AND RESULTS. In anesthetized dogs with sinoaortic and vagal deafferentation, we determined whether reflex sympathoexcitatory responses mediated by sympathetic afferents occurred during transmural myocardial ischemia. Reflex sympathoexcitation was quantitated by direct recording from either efferent renal (n = 20) or cardiac (n = 5) sympathetic nerves. Responses of arterial pressure and efferent sympathetic nerve activity were measured during simple occlusion of the anterior descending artery (LAD alone) and during LAD occlusion with a circumflex stenosis (LAD + CIRC). This circumflex stenosis was adjusted to abolish coronary vasodilator reserve without reducing basal flow. We observed significantly greater reflex increases in renal (32 +/- 5%) and cardiac (58 +/- 15%) nerve activity during LAD + CIRC than during LAD alone (14 +/- 6% and 8 +/- 7%, respectively). Reflex changes in renal nerve activity during LAD + CIRC were abolished by interruption of cardiac sympathetic afferent pathways (n = 5). In eight experiments, myocardial blood flow was measured during the two coronary occlusions. These experiments confirmed that LAD + CIRC elicited more transmural ischemia in the LAD distribution than did LAD alone. However, these experiments also revealed that LAD + CIRC elicited endocardial ischemia in the circumflex distribution. In five additional experiments, regional sympathetic deafferentation of the posterior left ventricle by epicardial application of 88% phenol along the atrioventricular groove had no significant effect on renal nerve responses to LAD + CIRC (36 +/- 5% increase before phenol versus 31 +/- 3% increase after phenol). These results indicate that endocardial ischemia in the circumflex distribution did not contribute to the reflex increases in nerve activity that were noted during LAD + CIRC. CONCLUSIONS. Reflex sympathoexcitation mediated by cardiac sympathetic afferents can be elicited in dogs. However, these responses are significant only during ischemia that is transmural and involves the superficial epicardial layers of the left ventricle},

abstract = {Microneurography is a method using metal microelectrodes to investigate directly identified neural traffic in myelinated as well as unmyelinated efferent and afferent nerves leading to and coming from muscle and skin in human peripheral nerves in situ. The present paper reviews how this technique has been used in clinical neurophysiology to elucidate the neural mechanisms of autonomic regulation, motor control and sensory functions in humans under physiological and pathological conditions. Microneurography is particularly important to investigate efferent and afferent neural traffic in unmyelinated C fibers. The recording of efferent discharges in postganglionic sympathetic C efferent fibers innervating muscle and skin (muscle sympathetic nerve activity; MSNA and skin sympathetic nerve activity; SSNA) provides direct information about neural control of autonomic effector organs including blood vessels and sweat glands. Sympathetic microneurography has become a potent tool to reveal neural functions and dysfunctions concerning blood pressure control and thermoregulation. This recording has been used not only in wake conditions but also in sleep to investigate changes in sympathetic neural traffic during sleep and sleep-related events such as sleep apnea. The same recording was also successfully carried out by astronauts during spaceflight. Recordings of afferent discharges from muscle mechanoreceptors have been used to understand the mechanisms of motor control. Muscle spindle afferent information is particularly important for the control of fine precise movements. It may also play important roles to predict behavior outcomes during learning of a motor task. Recordings of discharges in myelinated afferent fibers from skin mechanoreceptors have provided not only objective information about mechanoreceptive cutaneous sensation but also the roles of these signals in fine motor control. Unmyelinated mechanoreceptive afferent discharges from hairy skin seem to be important to convey cutaneous sensation to the central structures related to emotion. Recordings of afferent discharges in thin myelinated and unmyelinated fibers from nociceptors in muscle and skin have been used to provide information concerning pain. Recordings of afferent discharges of different types of cutaneous C-nociceptors identified by marking method have become an important tool to reveal the neural mechanisms of cutaneous sensations such as an itch. No direct microneurographic evidence has been so far proved regarding the effects of sympathoexcitation on sensitization of muscle and skin sensory receptors at least in healthy humans. {\textcopyright} 2006 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

abstract = {The autonomic nervous system (cANS) is essential for proper heart function, and complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias and even sudden cardiac death are associated with an altered cANS function. A changed innervation state may underlie (part of) the atrial and ventricular arrhythmias observed after myocardial infarction. In other cardiac diseases, such as congenital heart disease, autonomic dysfunction may be related to disease outcome. This is also the case after heart transplantation, when the heart is denervated. Interest in the origin of the autonomic nerve system has renewed since the role of autonomic function in disease progression was recognized, and some plasticity in autonomic regeneration is evident. As with many pathological processes, autonomic dysfunction based on pathological innervation may be a partial recapitulation of the early development of innervation. As such, insight into the development of cardiac innervation and an understanding of the cellular background contributing to cardiac innervation during different phases of development is required. This review describes the development of the cANS and focuses on the cellular contributions, either directly by delivering cells or indirectly by secretion of necessary factors or cell-derivatives.},

Here, we review the recent literature on the adrenergic and vagal abnormalities that have been reported in essential hypertension, with emphasis on their role as promoters and as amplifiers of the high blood pressure state. We also discuss the possible mechanisms underlying these abnormalities and their importance in the development and progression of the structural and functional cardiovascular damage that characterizes hypertension.
