abstract = {Hashimoto encephalopathy (HE) presents as an encephalopathy without central nervous system infection or tumor. HE is associated with autoimmune thyroiditis and is thus considered to be an autoimmune disorder. The prevalence of HE is low, but death and status epilepticus have been reported. HE manifests with a wide range of symptoms that include behavioral changes and confusion. Elevated thyroid antibodies are present in the majority of cases and are required for the diagnosis of HE. Normal brain MRI findings are found in the majority of patients diagnosed with HE. The most consistent CSF abnormality noted in HE patients is the presence of elevated protein. Most HE patients respond well to steroid therapy. Clinical improvements are also observed with IV immunoglobulin and plasmapheresis. In conclusion, it is now generally accepted that the diagnosis of HE must include encephalopathy characterized by cognitive impairment associated with psychiatric features, such as hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. Autoimmune encephalitis and prion disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis due to the similarity of the clinical features of these conditions to those of HE.},

abstract = {Hashimoto's encephalopathy (HE) has been described as an encephalopathy, with acute or subacute onset, accompanied by seizures, tremor, myoclonus, ataxia, psychosis, and stroke-like episodes, with a relapsing/remitting or progressive course. HE patients have positive antithyroid antibodies, are usually in a subclinical hypothyroid state, have elevated cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) protein, and have nonspecific electroencephalogram (EEG) and imaging abnormalities in the absence of CNS infection, tumor, or stroke. The authors present two cases of HE, demonstrating an excellent response to high dose steroids acutely followed by long-term treatment with steroids and other immunomodulatory agents. A review of the literature is also provided.},

abstract = {We describe a 59-year-old female with Hashimoto's encephalopathy whose presentation was characterized by a subacute onset of confusion, depressed level of consciousness, tremor and pyramidal signs. She was euthyroid on presentation but antithyroid antibodies were elevated. Hashimoto's thyroiditis was confirmed by thyroid biopsy. There was a spontaneous remission of the neurological disorder. Subacute encephalopathy is often investigated with thyroid function tests only. In cases of unexplained encephalopathy, thyroid antibodies and/or thyroid biopsy should be performed to exclude this condition. {\textcopyright} Pearson Professional Ltd 1997.},
