abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinically relevant arrhythmia in horses, with a reported prevalence up to 2.5{\%}. The pathophysiology has mainly been investigated in experimental animal models and human medicine, with limited studies in horses. Atrial fibrillation results from the interplay between electrical triggers and a susceptible substrate. Triggers consist of atrial premature depolarizations due to altered automaticity or triggered activity, or local (micro)reentry. The arrhythmia is promoted by atrial myocardial ion channel alterations, Ca2+ handling alterations, structural abnormalities, and autonomic nervous system imbalance. Predisposing factors include structural heart disease such as valvular regurgitation resulting in chronic atrial stretch, although many horses show so-called ‘lone AF' or idiopathic AF in which no underlying cardiac abnormalities can be detected using routine diagnostic techniques. These horses may have underlying ion channel dysfunction or undiagnosed myocardial (micro)structural alterations. Atrial fibrillation itself results in electrical, contractile and structural remodelling, fostering AF maintenance. Electrical remodelling leads to shortening of the atrial effective refractory period, promoting reentry. Contractile remodelling consists of decreased myocardial contractility, while structural remodelling includes the development of interstitial fibrosis and atrial enlargement. Reverse remodelling occurs after cardioversion to sinus rhythm, but full recovery may take weeks to months depending on duration of AF. The clinical signs of AF depend on the aerobic demands during exercise, ventricular rhythm response and presence of underlying cardiac disease. In horses with so-called ‘lone AF', clinical signs are usually absent at rest but during exercise poor performance, exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, respiratory distress, weakness or rarely collapse may develop.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Dog ownership has been associated with decreased cardiovascular risk. Recent reports have suggested an association of dog companionship with lower blood pressure levels, improved lipid profile, and diminished sympathetic responses to stress. However, it is unclear if dog ownership is associated with improved survival as previous studies have yielded inconsistent results. Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association of dog ownership with all-cause mortality, with and without prior cardiovascular disease, and cardiovascular mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS Studies published between 1950 and May 24, 2019 were identified by searching Embase and PubMed. Observational studies that evaluated baseline dog ownership and subsequent all-cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality. Two independent reviewers extracted the data. We assessed pooled data using random-effects model. A possible limitation was that the analyses were not adjusted for confounders. Ten studies were included yielding data from 3 837 005 participants (530 515 events; mean follow-up 10.1 years). Dog ownership was associated with a 24{\%} risk reduction for all-cause mortality as compared to nonownership (relative risk, 0.76; 95{\%} CI, 0.67-0.86) with 6 studies demonstrating significant reduction in the risk of death. Notably, in individuals with prior coronary events, living in a home with a dog was associated with an even more pronounced risk reduction for all-cause mortality (relative risk, 0.35; 95{\%} CI, 0.17-0.69; I2, 0{\%}). Moreover, when we restricted the analyses to studies evaluating cardiovascular mortality, dog ownership conferred a 31{\%} risk reduction for cardiovascular death (relative risk, 0.69; 95{\%} CI, 0.67-0.71; I2, 5.1{\%}). CONCLUSIONS Dog ownership is associated with lower risk of death over the long term, which is possibly driven by a reduction in cardiovascular mortality.

abstract = {The mouse is a common and cost-effective animal model for basic research, and the number of genetically engineered mouse models with cardiac phenotype is increasing. In vivo electrophysiological study in mice is similar to that performed in humans. It is indispensable for acquiring intracardiac electrocardiogram recordings and determining baseline cardiac cycle intervals. Furthermore, the use of programmed electrical stimulation enables determination of parameters such as sinoatrial conduction time, sinus node recovery time, atrioventricular-nodal conduction properties, Wenckebach periodicity, refractory periods and arrhythmia vulnerability. This protocol describes specific procedures for determining these parameters that were adapted from analogous human protocols for use in mice. We include details of ex vivo electrophysiological study, which provides detailed insights into intrinsic cardiac electrophysiology without external influences from humoral and neural factors. In addition, we describe a heart preparation with intact innervation by the vagus nerve that can be used as an ex vivo model for vagal control of the cardiac conduction system. Data acquisition for in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiological study takes {\~{}}1 h per mouse, depending on the number of stimulation protocols applied during the procedure. The technique yields highly reliable results and can be used for phenotyping of cardiac disease models, elucidating disease mechanisms and confirming functional improvements in gene therapy approaches as well as for drug and toxicity testing.},

abstract = {The mouse is a useful preclinical species for evaluating disease etiology due to the availability of a wide variety of genetically modified strains and the ability to perform disease-modifying manipulations. In order to establish an atrial filtration (AF) model in our laboratory, we profiled several commonly used murine AF models. We initially evaluated a pharmacological model of acute carbachol (CCh) treatment plus atrial burst pacing in C57BL/6 mice. In an effort to observe micro-reentrant circuits indicative of authentic AF, we employed optical mapping imaging in isolated mouse hearts. While CCh reduced atrial refractoriness and increased atrial tachyarrhythmia vulnerability, the left atrial (LA) excitation patterns were rather regular without reentrant circuits or wavelets. Therefore, the atrial tachyarrhythmia resembled high frequency atrial flutter, not typical AF per se. We next examined both a chronic angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion model and the surgical model of transverse aortic constriction (TAC), which have both been reported to induce atrial and ventricular structural changes that serve as a substrates for micro-reentrant AF. Although we observed some extent of atrial remodeling such as fibrosis or enlarged LA diameter, burst pacing-induced atrial tachyarrhythmia vulnerability did not differ from control mice in either model. This again suggested that an AF-like pathophysiology is difficult to demonstrate in the mouse. To continue searching for a valid murine AF model, we studied mice with a cardiac-specific deficiency (KO) in liver kinase B1 (Cardiac-LKB1), which has been reported to exhibit spontaneous AF. Indeed, the electrocardiograms (ECG) of conscious Cardiac-LKB1 KO mice exhibited no P waves and had irregular RR intervals, which are characteristics of AF. Histological evaluation of Cardiac-LKB1 KO mice revealed dilated and fibrotic atria, again consistent with AF. However, atrial electrograms and optical mapping revealed that electrical activity was limited to the sino-atrial node area with no electrical conduction into the atrial myocardium beyond. Thus, Cardiac-LKB1 KO mice have severe atrial myopathy or atrial standstill, but not AF. In summary, the atrial tachyarrhythmias we observed in the four murine models were distinct from typical human AF, which often exhibits micro- or macro-reentrant atrial circuits. Our results suggest that the four murine AF models we examined may not reflect human AF well, and raise a cautionary note for use of those murine models to study AF.},

abstract = {Cardiac arrhythmias are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, accounting for 10{\%} to 15{\%} of all deaths. Although most arrhythmias are due to acquired heart disease, inherited channelopathies and cardiomyopathies disproportionately affect children and young adults. Arrhythmogenesis is complex, involving anatomic structure, ion channels and regulatory proteins, and the interplay between cells in the conduction system, cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and the immune system. Animal models of arrhythmia are powerful tools for studying not only molecular and cellular mechanism of arrhythmogenesis but also more complex mechanisms at the whole heart level, and for testing therapeutic interventions. This review summarizes basic and clinical arrhythmia mechanisms followed by an in-depth review of published animal models of genetic and acquired arrhythmia disorders.},

abstract = {The mouse is a useful preclinical species for evaluating disease etiology due to the availability of a wide variety of genetically modified strains and the ability to perform disease-modifying manipulations. In order to establish an atrial filtration (AF) model in our laboratory, we profiled several commonly used murine AF models. We initially evaluated a pharmacological model of acute carbachol (CCh) treatment plus atrial burst pacing in C57BL/6 mice. In an effort to observe micro-reentrant circuits indicative of authentic AF, we employed optical mapping imaging in isolated mouse hearts. While CCh reduced atrial refractoriness and increased atrial tachyarrhythmia vulnerability, the left atrial (LA) excitation patterns were rather regular without reentrant circuits or wavelets. Therefore, the atrial tachyarrhythmia resembled high frequency atrial flutter, not typical AF per se. We next examined both a chronic angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion model and the surgical model of transverse aortic constriction (TAC), which have both been reported to induce atrial and ventricular structural changes that serve as a substrates for micro-reentrant AF. Although we observed some extent of atrial remodeling such as fibrosis or enlarged LA diameter, burst pacing-induced atrial tachyarrhythmia vulnerability did not differ from control mice in either model. This again suggested that an AF-like pathophysiology is difficult to demonstrate in the mouse. To continue searching for a valid murine AF model, we studied mice with a cardiac-specific deficiency (KO) in liver kinase B1 (Cardiac-LKB1), which has been reported to exhibit spontaneous AF. Indeed, the electrocardiograms (ECG) of conscious Cardiac-LKB1 KO mice exhibited no P waves and had irregular RR intervals, which are characteristics of AF. Histological evaluation of Cardiac-LKB1 KO mice revealed dilated and fibrotic atria, again consistent with AF. However, atrial electrograms and optical mapping revealed that electrical activity was limited to the sino-atrial node area with no electrical conduction into the atrial myocardium beyond. Thus, Cardiac-LKB1 KO mice have severe atrial myopathy or atrial standstill, but not AF. In summary, the atrial tachyarrhythmias we observed in the four murine models were distinct from typical human AF, which often exhibits micro- or macro-reentrant atrial circuits. Our results suggest that the four murine AF models we examined may not reflect human AF well, and raise a cautionary note for use of those murine models to study AF.},
