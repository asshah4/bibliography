abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the stability of short recordings of heart rate variability (HRV) with time, and the association of HRV with age and sex. DESIGN: Five minute Holter recordings were made twice over a two month interval (tracking study). In addition, HRV was measured in a cross sectional study. SETTING: Residents of 11 Israeli kibbutzim were examined in their settlements. SUBJECTS: 32 men and 38 women (aged 31-67) participated in the tracking study and 294 (aged 35-65) were involved in the cross sectional study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time and frequency domain analyses on Holter recordings were undertaken in two breathing conditions: spontaneous and controlled breathing (15 respirations per minute). Regression was used to assess the relations of sex, age, heart rate, and logarithmically transformed HRV indices. RESULTS: HRV measures were highly consistent with time with correlations of 0.76-0.80 for high frequency and total power. Geometric mean total power declined with age by 45% in men and 32% in women, and was lower by 24% among women than among men (all p < or = 0.005). Men had a 34% higher very low and low frequency power and a higher ratio of low to high frequency power (p < 0.001). Conversely, high frequency power in women represents a greater proportion of total power than in men. CONCLUSION: Short recordings of HRV in a non-laboratory setting are stable over months and therefore characteristic of an individual. Strong age and sex effects were evident. HRV derived from short recordings can be informative in population based studies.},

abstract = {Metrics of heart period variability are widely used in the behavioral and biomedical sciences, although somewhat confusingly labeled as heart rate variability (HRV). Despite their wide use, HRV metrics are usually analyzed and interpreted without reference to prevailing levels of cardiac chronotropic state (i.e., mean heart rate or mean heart period). This isolated treatment of HRV metrics is nontrivial. All HRV metrics routinely used in the literature exhibit a known and positive relationship with the mean duration of the interval between two beats (heart period): as the heart period increases, so does its variability. This raises the question of whether HRV metrics should be “corrected” for the mean heart period (or its inverse, the heart rate). Here, we outline biological, quantitative, and interpretive issues engendered by this question. We provide arguments that HRV is neither uniformly nor simply a surrogate for heart period. We also identify knowledge gaps that remain to be satisfactorily addressed with respect to assumptions underlying existing HRV correction approaches. In doing so, we aim to stimulate further progress toward the rigorous use and disciplined interpretation of HRV. We close with provisional guidance on HRV reporting that acknowledges the complex interplay between the mean and variability of the heart period.},

abstract = {This study was performed to assess the effects of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on the ultra-low (ULF) and very low (VLF) frequency components of heart rate variability (HRV). Forty-nine CABG patients (aged from 38 to 77 years) were examined by 24-h ambulatory electrocardiographic (AECG) monitoring, both preoperatively and 4 weeks after CABG. HRV spectral components were obtained by maximum entropy method analysis. Then the ULF, VLF, low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF) and total frequency (TF) components were compared before and after CABG. The average 24-h heart rate increased significantly after CABG (69+/-11.5 vs 82.9+/-10.9 beats per minute [bpm], P < 0.0001). The power of the ULF, VLF, and LF spectral components showed a decrease after surgery (2,859.9 vs 1,601.2 ms2, P<0.0001, 1,215.0 vs 572.3 ms2, P<0.0001, and 260.3 vs 125.9 ms2, P< 0.002, respectively), but the HF power did not show any significant change (98.7 vs 125.9 ms2, NS). Analysis of the normalized ratio of the ULF component (ULF/TF ratio) revealed a significant increase postoperatively (0.6496+/-0.0931 vs 0.7003+/-0.1338, P < 0.0001), but the VLF/TF and LF/TF ratios decreased after CABG (from 0.2671+/-0.0689 to 0.2040+/-0.0832, P< 0.0001 and from 0.0568+/-0.0290 to 0.0429+/-0.0232, P< 0.0088, respectively). In contrast, there was no significant alteration in the HF/TF ratio. These results suggest that recovery of cardiac autonomic activity is delayed after surgery. However, improvement of the ULF/TF ratio, one of the prognostic indicators for patients with cardiac disease, should be related to the relief of myocardial ischemia by CABG.},

abstract = {A method of determining baroreceptor reflex sensitivity is proposed that is based on spectral analysis of systolic pressure values and RR interval times, namely, the modulus (or gain) in the mid frequency band (0.07-0.14 Hz) between these two signals. Results using this method were highly correlated (0.94; n = 8) with results of the phenylephrine method.

abstract = {AIMS: Dyx is a new heart rate variability (HRV) density analysis specifically designed to identify patients at high risk for malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The aim of this study was to test if Dyx can improve risk stratification for malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias and to test if the previously identified cut-off can be reproduced. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 248 patients from the CARISMA study with ejection fraction ≤40% after an acute myocardial infarction and an analysable 24 h Holter recording. All patients received an implantable cardiac monitor, which was used to diagnose the primary endpoint of near-fatal or fatal ventricular tachyarrhythmias likely preventable by an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), during a period of 2 years. A Dyx ≤ 1.96 was considered abnormal. The secondary endpoint was cardiovascular death. At enrolment 59 patients (24%) had a Dyx ≤ 1.96 and 20 experienced a primary endpoint. A Dyx ≤ 1.96 was associated with a significantly increased risk for malignant arrhythmias [hazards ratio (HR) = 4.36 (1.81–10.52), P = 0.001] and cardiovascular death [HR = 3.47 (1.38–8.74), P = 0.008]. Compared with important clinical risk parameters (age >70 years and QRS > 120 ms), Dyx ≤ 1.96 significantly added predictive value (P = 0.0066). CONCLUSIONS: Dyx was a better predictor of ventricular tachyarrhythmias than the traditional measures of HRV and heart rate turbulence, particularly in the elderly. Dyx might be a useful tool for better selection of ICD candidates in the elderly population, since a normal Dyx in this group was associated with a very low risk for malignant ventricular arrhythmias.

abstract = {Background A reduction of complexity of heart beating interval variability that is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality in cardiovascular disease states is thought to derive from the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic neural impulses to the heart. However, rhythmic clocklike behavior intrinsic to pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node (SAN) drives their beating, even in the absence of autonomic neural input. Objective To test how this rhythmic clocklike behavior intrinsic to pacemaker cells interacts with autonomic impulses to the heart beating interval variability in vivo. Methods We analyzed beating interval variability in time and frequency domains and by fractal and entropy analyses: (1) in vivo, when the brain input to the SAN is intact; (2) during autonomic denervation in vivo; (3) in isolated SAN tissue (ie, in which the autonomic neural input is completely absent); (4) in single pacemaker cells isolated from the SAN; and (5) after autonomic receptor stimulation of these cells. Results Spontaneous beating intervals of pacemaker cells residing in the isolated SAN tissue exhibit fractal-like behavior and have lower approximate entropy compared with those in the intact heart. Isolation of pacemaker cells from SAN tissue, however, leads to a loss in the beating interval order and fractal-like behavior. $\beta$-Adrenergic receptor stimulation of isolated pacemaker cells increases intrinsic clock synchronization, decreases their action potential period, and increases system complexity. Conclusions Both the average beating interval in vivo and beating interval complexity are conferred by the combined effects of clock periodicity intrinsic to pacemaker cells and their response to autonomic neural input. {\textcopyright} 2014 Heart Rhythm Society.},

abstract = {A high degree of heart rate (HR) variability is found in compensated hearts with good function, whereas HR variability can be decreased with severe coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, aging and diabetic neuropathy. To test the hypothesis that HR variability is a predictor of long-term survival after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the Holter tapes of 808 patients who survived AMI were analyzed. Heart rate variability was defined as the standard deviation of all normal RR intervals in a 24-hour continuous electrocardiogram recording made 11 ± 3 days after AMI. In all patients demographic, clinical and laboratory variables were measured at baseline. Mean follow-up time was 31 months. Of all Holter variables measured, HR variability had the strongest univariate correlation with mortality. The relative risk of mortality was 5.3 times higher in the group with HR variability of less than 50 ms than the group with HR variability of more than 100 ms. HR variability remained a significant predictor of mortality after adjusting for clinical, demographic, other Holter features and ejection fraction. A hypothesis to explain this finding is that decreased HR variability correlates with increased sympathetic or decreased vagal tone, which may predispose to ventricular fibrillation. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) is the consequence of various influences of the autonomic nervous system on heart rate. The influence of the respiration rate on HRV is well accepted (respiratory sinus arrhythmia: RSA). The extent of different respira- tion rates on HRV however, is not greatly appreciated. In our study, we stored a modified chest wall electrocardiogram on magnetic tape (Tracker, Reynolds) for later analysis (Pathfinder IV, RR-tools, Reynolds). 15 volunteers performed controlled respiration at six different 6 min-intervals: below the low-frequency range (LF) of the power spectrum (0.03 Hz), within LF (0.08, 0.10 and 0.13 Hz), within the high-frequency range (HF; 0.25 Hz), and above HF (0.50 Hz). HRV was expressed in the time domain in terms of standard deviation (SDNN), root mean square successive difference (RMSSD) and the percentage of differences between adjacent normal RR intervals that are > 50 ms (pNN50). After fast Fourier transformation, HRV was expressed in the frequency domain in terms of LF power (0.05–0.15 Hz), HF power (0.15–0.45 Hz), and the ratio (R) of LF to HF. Heart rate (72 ± 11 min-1) remained unchanged throughout the protocol, indicating a steady haemodynamic state. HRV differed up to 33 % in SDNN, 37 % in RMSSD and 75 % in pNN50 between the different respiration rates. LF power differed up to 72 % (p < 0.10), HF power up to 36 % and R up to 48 % (p < 0.10). Reproducibility seems satisfactory for the short-term analysis. Respiration rate-induced changes in the time domain meas- urements were not significant. Because of the large scatter of RMSSD and pNN50, we suggest SDNN as a reliable, easily accessible, and illustrative measurement for assessment of HRV. Respiration clearly affected the frequency domain measure- ments of HRV via shifts in the respiratory sinus arrhythmia. If major changes in respiration rate are to be expected, these should be interpreted with caution. On the other hand, the characteristic RSA-induced shifts in the frequency range could possibly be useful to determine respiration rate in freely moving individuals.

Interval and vector data that are commonly available on modern ECGs may offer independent prognostic information that improves risk classification.</p><h3>Objectives</h3><p>To derive and validate a CVD risk equation based on ECG metrics and to determine its incremental benefit in addition to the Framingham risk score (FRS).</p><h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3><p>This study included 3640 randomly selected community-based adults aged 40 to 74 years without known CVD from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) cohort (1971-1975) and 6329 from the NHANES III cohort (1988-1994). Participants were sampled from across the United States. A risk score to assess incident nonfatal and fatal CVD events was derived based on computer-generated ECG data, including frontal P, R, and T axes; heart rate; and PR, QRS, and QT intervals from NHANES I. The most prognostic variables, along with age and sex, were incorporated into the NHANES ECG risk equation. The equation was evaluated in the NHANES III cohort for an independent validation. Follow-up in the NHANES III cohort was completed on December 31, 2006. Data for this study were analyzed from August 11, 2015, to May 20, 2016.</p><h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3><p>The primary end point was CVD death. Secondary outcomes included 10-year ischemic heart disease and all-cause death.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>The final study sample included 9969 participants (4714 men [47.3%]; 5255 women [52.7%]; mean [SD] age, 55.3 [10.1] years) from both cohorts. Frontal T axis, heart rate, and heart rate–corrected QT interval were the most significant ECG factors in the NHANES I cohort. In the validation cohort (NHANES III), the equation provided for prognostic information for fatal CVD with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.23 (95% CI, 2.82-3.72); the C statistic was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.76-0.81). When added to the FRS in Cox proportional hazards regression models, the categorical (1%, 5%, and 10% cutoffs) net reclassification improvement was 24%. When the FRS and ECG scores were combined in a single model, the C statistic improved by 0.04 (95% CI, 0.02-0.06) to 0.80 (95% CI, 0.77-0.82). Similar improvements were noted when the ECG score was added to the pooled cohort equation. When the equation for prognostic information about ischemic heart disease and all-cause death was evaluated, the results were similar.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>An ECG risk score based on age, sex, heart rate, frontal T axis, and QT interval assesses the risk for CVD and compares favorably with the FRS alone in an independent cohort of asymptomatic individuals. Although the ECG risk equation is low cost, further research is needed to ascertain whether this additional step in risk stratification may improve prevention efforts and reduce CVD events.</p>},

abstract = {Power spectral analysis of the beat-to-beat variations of heart rate or the heart period (R–R interval) has become widely used to quantify cardiac autonomic regulation (Appel et al., 1989; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Denver et al., 2007; Thayler et al., 2010; Billman, 2011). This technique partitions the total variance (the “power”) of a continuous series of beats into its frequency components, typically identifying two or three main peaks: Very Low Frequency (VLF) <0.04 Hz, Low Frequency (LF), 0.04–0.15 Hz, and High Frequency (HF) 0.15–0.4 Hz. It should be noted that the HF peak is shifted to a higher range (typically 0.24–1.04 Hz) in infants and during exercise (Berntson et al., 1997). The HF peak is widely believed to reflect cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity while the LF, although more complex, is often assumed to have a dominant sympathetic component (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Billman, 2011). Based upon these assumptions, Pagani and co-workers proposed that the ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF) could be used to quantify the changing relationship between sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activities (i.e., the sympatho-vagal balance) (Pagani et al., 1984, 1986; Malliani et al., 1991) in both health and disease. However, this concept has been challenged (Kingwell et al., 1994; Koh et al., 1994; Hopf et al., 1995; Eckberg, 1997; Houle and Billman, 1999; Billman, 2011). Despite serious and largely under-appreciated limitations, the LF/HF ratio has gained wide acceptance as a tool to assess cardiovascular autonomic regulation where increases in LF/HF are assumed to reflect a shift to “sympathetic dominance” and decreases in this index correspond to a “parasympathetic dominance.” Therefore, it is vital to provide a critical assessment of the assumptions upon which this concept is based.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Contemporary implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICD) enable storage of multiple, preepisode R-R recordings in patients who suffered from ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VTA). Timely prediction of VTA, using heart rate variability (HRV) analysis techniques, may facilitate the implementation of preventive and therapeutic strategies.\n\nAIM: To evaluate the novel multipole method of the HRV analysis in prediction of imminent VTAs in ICD patients.\n\nMETHODS: We screened patients from the Biotronik HAWAI Registry (Heart Rate Analysis with Automated ICDs). A total of 28 patients from the HAWAI registries (phase I and II), having medical records, who had experienced documented, verified VTA during the 2-year follow-up, were included in our analysis. HRV during preepisode recordings of 4,500 R-R intervals were analyzed using the Dyx parameter and compared to HRV of similar length recordings from the same patients that were not followed by arrhythmia.\n\nRESULTS: Our study population consisted mainly of men 25 of 28 (89%), average age of 64.8 ± 9.4 years, 92% with coronary artery disease. HRV during 64 preevent recordings (2.3 events per patient on average) was analyzed and compared with 60 control recordings. The multipole method of HRV analysis showed 50% sensitivity and 91.6% specificity for prediction of ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation in the study population, with 84.5% positive predictive value. No statistically significant correlation was found between various clinical parameters and the sensitivity of imminent VTA predetection in our patients.\n\nCONCLUSION: The multipole method of HRV analysis emerges as a highly specific, possible predictor of imminent VTA, providing an early warning allowing to prepare for an arrhythmic episode.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV), the changes in the beat-to-beat heart rate calculated from the electrocar- diogram (ECG), is a key indicator of an individual's cardiovascular condition. Assessment of HRV has been shown to aid clinical diagnosis and intervention strategies. However, the variety of HRV estima- tion methods and contradictory reports in this field indicate that there is a need for a more rigorous investigation of these methods as aids to clinical evaluation. This thesis investigates the development of appropriate HRV signal processing techniques in the context of pilot studies in two fields of potential application, sleep and head-up tilting (HUT). A novel method for characterising normality in the ECG using both timing information and morpho- logical characteristics is presented. A neural network, used to learn the beat-to-beat variations in ECG waveform morphology, is shown to provide a highly sensitive technique for identifying normal beats. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based frequency-domain HRV techniques, which require re-sampling of the inherently unevenly sampled heart beat time-series (RR tachogram) to produce an evenly sampled time series, are then explored using a newmethod for producing an artificial RRtachogram. Re-sampling is shown to produce a significant error in the estimation of an (entirely specified) artificial RR tachogram. The Lomb periodogram, a method which requires no re-sampling and is applicable to the unevenly sampled nature of the signal is investigated. Experiments demonstrate that the Lomb periodogram is superior to the FFT for evaluating HRV measured by the ?? -ratio, a ratio of the low to high frequency ?? power in the RR tachogram within a specified band (0.04–0.4Hz). The effect of adding artificial ectopic beats in the RR tachogram is then considered and it is shown that ectopic beats significantly alter the spectrum and therefore must be removed or replaced. Replacing ectopic beats by phantom beats is compared to the case of ectopic-realted RR interval removal for the FFT and Lomb methods for varying levels of ectopy. The Lomb periodogram is shown to provide a significantly better estimate of the ?? - ?? ratio under these conditions and is a robust method for measuring the ?? -ratio in the presence of (a ?? possibly unknown number of) ectopic beats or artefacts. The Lomb periodogram and FFT-based techniques are applied to a database of sleep apn ? ic and normal subjects. A new method of assessing HRVduring sleep is proposed to minimise the confounding effects on HRV of changes due to changing mental activity. Estimation of ?? -ratio using the Lomb ?? technique is shown to separate these two patient groups more effectively than with FFT-based techniques. Results are also presented for the application of these methods to controlled (HUT) studies on subjects with syncope, an autonomic nervous system problem, which indicate that the techniques developed in this thesis may provide a method for differentiating between sub-classes of syncope},

abstract = {Abstract Variability metrics hold promise as potential indicators for autonomic function, prediction of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, psychophysiological status, and general wellness. Although the investigation of heart rate variability (HRV) has been prevalent for several decades, the methods used for preprocessing, windowing, and choosing appropriate parameters lacks consensus among academic and clinical investigators. Moreover, many of the important steps are omitted from publications, preventing reproducibility. To address this, we have compiled a comprehensive and open-source modular toolbox for calculating HRV metrics and other related variability indices, on both raw cardiovascular time series, and RR intervals. The software, known as the PhysioNet Cardiovascular Signal Toolbox, is implemented in the MATLAB programming language, with standard (open) input and output formats, and requires no external libraries. The functioning of our software is compared with other widely used and referenced HRV toolboxes to identify important differences. Our findings demonstrate how modest differences in the approach to HRV analysis can lead to divergent results, a factor that might have contributed to the lack of repeatability of studies and clinical applicability of HRV metrics. Existing HRV toolboxes do not include standardized preprocessing, signal quality indices (for noisy segment removal), and abnormal rhythm detection and are therefore likely to lead to significant errors in the presence of moderate to high noise or arrhythmias. We therefore describe the inclusion of validated tools to address these issues. We also make recommendations for default values and testing/reporting.},

abstract = {Background: Various disciplines use quantification of heart rate variability (HRV) as an indicator of autonomic function without recognizing the importance of using standardized methodologies. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of tachogram length and period of recording on HRV indicator values. Methods: To test the influence of the length of the recording time, HRV indicator values calculated from 180, 300, 420, and 600 seconds recording periods (supine and standing) were compared. Also individual 3- minute periods (0-180 seconds, 180-360 seconds, 360-540 seconds) from 10-minute (supine and standing) tachograms were compared. Results: In the supine position, vagal-efferent HRV indicators were not influenced by tachogram length varying between 3 and 10 minutes (P > 0.05). Supine HRV indicator values representing combined sympathetic and parasympathetic influences were tachogram length-dependent (P < 0.05). During orthostatic stress all HRV indicators were tachogram length-dependent (P < 0.05). Upon standing up marked vagal withdrawal and sympathetic activation occurred. Vagal withdrawal tapered off during the 3-6-minute period after rising while indicators representing combined vagal and sympathetic activation were totally reversed. Conclusions: During application of orthostatic stress the exact starting point of recording, as well as the length of recording, is critical due to the activation and normalization of homeostatic mechanisms. Starting the tachogram recording too late will miss out on part of the initial response to change in body position. Longer recording times will give a combination of values recorded during the stress response and values obtained after stabilization in the standing position.

abstract = {Following the publication of the Task Force document on heart rate variability (HRV) in 1996, a number of articles have been published to describe new HRV methodologies and their application in different physiological and clinical studies. This document presents a critical review of the new methods. A particular attention has been paid to methodologies that have not been reported in the 1996 standardization document but have been more recently tested in sufficiently sized populations. The following methods were considered: Long-range correlation and fractal analysis; Short-term complexity; Entropy and regularity; and Nonlinear dynamical systems and chaotic behaviour. For each of these methods, technical aspects, clinical achievements, and suggestions for clinical application were reviewed. While the novel approaches have contributed in the technical understanding of the signal character of HRV, their success in developing new clinical tools, such as those for the identification of high-risk patients, has been rather limited. Available results obtained in selected populations of patients by specialized laboratories are nevertheless of interest but new prospective studies are needed. The investigation of new parameters, descriptive of the complex regulation mechanisms of heart rate, has to be encouraged because not all information in the HRV signal is captured by traditional methods. The new technologies thus could provide after proper validation, additional physiological, and clinical meaning. Multidisciplinary dialogue and specialized courses in the combination of clinical cardiology and complex signal processing methods seem warranted for further advances in studies of cardiac oscillations and in the understanding normal and abnormal cardiac control processes.},

abstract = {Diminished baroreflex sensitivity in the morning negatively influences morning coronary blood flow and blood pressure control in hypertensive patients. Our aim was to determine the contribution of the mechanical and neural components of the cardiac baroreflex to diurnal variation in blood pressure control. In 12 healthy participants, we used the modified Oxford method to quantify baroreflex sensitivity for rising (G(up)) and falling (G(down)) pressures in the morning (7:00 am) and afternoon (4:00 pm). Beat-to-beat blood pressure, R-R intervals, and carotid artery diameter measurements were recorded. Integrated sensitivity was determined by plotting R-R intervals against systolic blood pressure. The mechanical component was carotid artery diameter plotted against systolic blood pressure, and the neural component was R-R intervals plotted against carotid artery diameter. Linear mixed models were used to compare the integrated, mechanical, and neural sensitivities between morning and afternoon. We found significant diurnal variation in integrated sensitivity, with an attenuated response in the morning (G(up)=13.0±0.6; G(down)=6.3±0.4 ms/mm Hg) when compared with the afternoon (G(up)=15.1±0.6; G(down)=12.6±0.4 ms/mm Hg). For rising pressures, the diminished integrated sensitivity in the morning was caused by a reduction in mechanical sensitivity, whereas for falling pressures it was caused by a reduction in neural sensitivity. Our findings explicate the mechanisms underlying diurnal variation in baroreflex function. Pharmacological and lifestyle interventions targeted specifically at the diminished component of the cardiac baroreflex in the morning may lead to better management of hypertension.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND We studied 715 patients 2 weeks after myocardial infarction to establish the associations between six frequency domain measures of heart period variability (HPV) and mortality during 4 years of follow-up. METHODS AND RESULTS Each measure of HPV had a significant and at least moderately strong univariate association with all-cause mortality, cardiac death, and arrhythmic death. Power in the lower-frequency bands--ultra low frequency (ULF) and very low frequency (VLF) power--had stronger associations with all three mortality end points than power in the higher-frequency bands--low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) power. The 24-hour total power also had a significant and strong association with all three mortality end points. VLF power was the only variable that was more strongly associated with arrhythmic death than with cardiac death or all-cause mortality. In multivariate Cox regression models using a step-up approach to evaluate the independent associations between frequency domain measures of heart period variability and death of all causes, ULF power was selected first (i.e., was the single component with the strongest association). Adding VLF or LF power to the Cox regression model significantly improved the prediction of outcome. With both ULF and VLF power in the Cox regression model, the addition of the other two components, LF and HF power, singly or together, did not significantly improve the prediction of all-cause mortality. We explored the relation between the heart period variability measures and all-cause mortality, cardiac death, and arrhythmic death before and after adjusting for five previously established postinfarction risk predictors: age, New York Heart Association functional class, rales in the coronary care unit, left ventricular ejection fraction, and ventricular arrhythmias detected in a 24-hour Holter ECG recording. CONCLUSIONS After adjustment for the five risk predictors, the association between mortality and total, ULF, and VLF power remained significant and strong, whereas LF and HF power were only moderately strongly associated with mortality. The tendency for VLF power to be more strongly associated with arrhythmic death than with all-cause or cardiac death was still evident after adjusting for the five covariates. Adding measures of HPV to previously known predictors of risk after myocardial infarction identifies small subgroups with a 2.5-year mortality risk of approximately 50%.},

abstract = {Background: A major objective of precision medicine is the elucidation of non-invasive biomarkers of cardiovascular (CV) risk. Recently, we introduced a new dynamical marker of sino-atrial instability, termed heart rate fragmentation (HRF), which outperformed traditional and nonlinear heart rate variability metrics in separating ostensibly healthy subjects from patients with coronary artery disease. Accordingly, we hypothesized that HRF may be a dynamical biomarker of adverse cardiovascular events (CVEs). Methods: This study employed data from a cohort of participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a prospective study of sub-clinical heart disease. Interbeat interval time series (n = 1963), derived from the electrocardiographic channel of the polysomnogram study, were analyzed using the newly introduced metrics of fragmentation, as well as traditional heart rate variability (HRV) indices and the short-term detrended fluctuation analysis exponent. Cox regression analysis was used to assess the association between HR dynamic indices and CV outcomes in unadjusted and adjusted models. Results: The mean (± SD) follow-up time was 2.97 ± 0.63 years. In adjusted models, higher fragmentation was significantly associated with incident CVEs (number of events; hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: n = 72, 1.43 [1.16-1.76]) and CV death (n = 21; 1.65 [1.15-2.36]). The traditional HRV and the fractal indices were not associated with CVEs or CV death. The most discriminatory fragmentation indices added significant value to Framingham and MESA CV risk indices in all analyses. Costa et al. Heart Rate Fragmentation and Cardiac Risk Conclusion: Our findings show that HRF has promise as a non-invasive, automatable biomarker of CV risk. The basic mechanisms underlying fragmentation remain to be delineated. Its association with incident outcomes raises the possibility of connections to degenerative changes in the multisystem network controlling SAN function.},

abstract = {Attenuated cardiac parasympathetic activity appear to be an important risk factor contributing to sudden cardiac death in subjects with overt coronary disease but its predictive value in otherwise healthy normal subjects is not known. We have for 8 years followed 260 apparently healthy adult subjects who underwent Holter monitoring. Twelve died, 14 developed ischaemic heart disease and four suffered sudden cardiac death. A healthy control subject was matched, along with other risk factors, for each case. In each subject 24-h heart rate variability was calculated as the deviation of all normal R-R intervals from mean R-R (SD) and the percentage of successive R-R interval differences exceeding 6% (%DIF6%)--this was used as an index of cardiac parasympathetic activity. There were no significant differences in heart rate variability between the cases developing problems and controls. In the sudden cardiac death victims, however, there was a clear trend towards lower heart rate variability. In them waketime mean SD was 73 ms versus 85 ms for cases and controls respectively (p = 0.08), and for sleeptime 61 ms versus 76 ms (p = 0.07). Compared to normal limits for heart rate variability obtained in 140 subjects that remained healthy for 8 years, figures for both SD and %DIF6% in sudden cardiac death subjects were at or below 95% confidence limits. The results indicate that altered autonomic balance may contribute to sudden cardiac death even in apparently healthy subjects. Subjects with a low 24-h heart rate variability on Holter monitoring may be predicted at an early stage of being at greater risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Reliable and effective noninvasive measures of sympathetic and parasympathetic peripheral outflow are of crucial importance in cardiovascular physiology. Although many techniques have been proposed to take up this long-lasting challenge, none has proposed a satisfying discrimination of the dynamics of the two separate branches. Spectral analysis of heart rate variability is the most currently used technique for such assessment. Despite its widespread use, it has been demonstrated that the subdivision in the low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) bands does not fully reflect separate influences of the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches, respectively, mainly due to their simultaneous action in the LF. Two novel heartbeat-derived autonomic measures, the sympathetic activity index (SAI) and parasympathetic activity index (PAI), are proposed to separately assess the time-varying autonomic nervous system synergic functions. Their efficacy is validated in landmark autonomic maneuvers generally employed in clinical settings. The novel measures move beyond the classical frequency domain paradigm through identification of a set of coefficients associated with a proper combination of Laguerre base functions. The resulting measures were compared with the traditional LF and HF power. A total of 236 ECG recordings were analyzed for validation, including autonomic outflow changes elicited by procedures of different nature and temporal variation, such as postural changes, lower body negative pressure, and handgrip tests. The proposed SAI-PAI measures consistently outperform traditional frequency-domain indexes in tracking expected instantaneous autonomic variations, both vagal and sympathetic, and may aid clinical decision making, showing reduced intersubject variability and physiologically plausible dynamics.NEW & NOTEWORTHY While it is possible to obtain reliable estimates of parasympathetic activity from the ECG, a satisfying method to disentangle the sympathetic component from HRV has not been proposed yet.

abstract = {By analysis of spectral components of heart rate variability, sympathovagal interaction was assessed in patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). At 2 weeks after AMI (n = 70), the low-frequency component was significantly greater (69 ± 2 vs 53 ± 3 normalized units [NU], p < 0.05) and the high-frequency component was significantly smaller (17 ± 1 vs 35 ± 3 NU) than in 26 age-matched control subjects. This difference was likely to reflect an alteration of sympathovagal regulatory outflows with a predominance of sympathetic activity. At 6 (n = 33) and 12 (n = 29) months after AMI, a progressive decrease in the low- (62 ± 2 and 54 ± 3 NU) and an increase in the high-frequency (23 ± 2 and 30 ± 2 NU) spectral components was observed, which suggested a normalization of sympathovagal interaction. An increase in sympathetic efferent activity induced by tilt did not further modify the low-frequency spectral component (78 ± 3 vs 74 ± 3 NU) in a subgroup of 24 patients at 2 weeks after AMI. Instead, 1 year after AMI, this maneuver was accompanied by an increase in the low-frequency component (77 ± 3 vs 53 ± 3 NU, p < 0.05) of a magnitude similar to the one observed in control subjects (78 ± 3 vs 53 ± 3 NU). These data indicate that the sympathetic predominance that is detectable 2 weeks after AMI is followed by recovery of vagal tone and a normalization of sympathovagal interaction, not only during resting conditions, but also in response to a sympathetic stimulus. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

Three 10-second and 2 six-minute heart rate recordings were obtained during each of 2 visits, separated by 1 to 2 weeks. We partitioned the measurement error into components and computed intraclass correlation coefficients using nested, random effects models. Repeatability improved with the length of recording: intraclass correlation coefficients were greater than 0.7 for 6-minute measures and 2-minute time domain measures and greater than 0.5 for 2-minute frequency domain measures. Repeatability of measures from 10-second records was lower, but improved considerably when the mean from 2 or 3 records was used. Correlations between the same measures from different length recordings were quite high. Our findings support the use of records of at least 5 minutes in length in epidemiological studies, in accordance with previous guidelines. Researchers using 10-second records should consider taking the mean of several recordings, when possible, or using statistical methods to correct for measurement error.},

abstract = {Dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system has been implicated in the development of hypertension. Heart rate variability is a noninvasive tool to quantitatively estimate cardiac autonomic activity and has been used to document decreased cardiac autonomic activity in hypertension. The ability of decreased heart rate variability to predict incident hypertension has not been well studied, and there are no studies of whether hypertension leads to changes in heart rate variability. We investigated the temporal sequence linking hypertension, blood pressure, and heart rate variability in a population-based cohort of 11 061 individuals aged 45 to 54 years at baseline. Individuals with hypertension had decreased heart rate variability at baseline, and this association was present across the full blood pressure range. Among 7099 individuals without hypertension at baseline, low heart rate variability predicted greater risk of incident hypertension over 9 years of follow-up. The hazard ratio (95% confidence interval {[CI])} for the lowest compared with the highest quartile of the standard deviation of normal-to-normal {R-R} intervals was 1.24 (95% {CI,} 1.10–1.40), for the root mean square of successive differences in normal-to-normal {R-R} intervals was 1.36 (95% {CI,} 1.21–1.54), and for {R-R} interval was 1.44 (95% {CI,} 1.27–1.63). Over 9 years, there was no measurable difference in the rate of change in heart rate variability among those with and without hypertension, although the differences in heart rate variability at follow-up were smaller than those at baseline. These findings thus support the thesis that the autonomic nervous system is involved in the development of hypertension, yet suggest that differences in the autonomic profile of hypertensives and normotensives do not increase with time.},

abstract = {The Poincare plot emerges as an effective tool for assessing cardiovascular autonomic regulation. It displays nonlinear characteristics of heart rate variability (HRV) from electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings and gives a global view of the long range of ECG signals. In the telemedicine or computer-aided diagnosis system, it would offer significant auxiliary information for diagnosis if the patterns of the Poincare plots can be automatically classified. Therefore, we developed an automatic classification system to distinguish five geometric patterns of the Poincare plots from four types of cardiac arrhythmias. The statistics features are designed on measurements and an ensemble classifier of three types of neural networks is proposed. Aiming at the difficulty to set a proper threshold for classifying the multiple categories, the threshold selection strategy is analyzed. 24 h ECG monitoring recordings from 674 patients, which have four types of cardiac arrhythmias, are adopted for recognition. For comparison, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers with linear and Gaussian kernels are also applied. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the extracted features and the better performance of the designed classifier. Our study can be applied to diagnose the corresponding sinus rhythm and arrhythmia substrates disease automatically in the telemedicine and computer-aided diagnosis system.},

To directly investigate the viability of such neurotransmission, the effects of acute transmural myocardial infarction on conduction in the intrinsic cardiac nerves overlying and distal to an experimentally induced acute transmural myocardial infarction were studied. In eight dogs, during control states electrical stimulation of the epicardium adjacent to a coronary artery produced compound action potentials in the more cranially located cardiopulmonary nerves. Thereafter, in four dogs an acute transmural myocardial infarction was produced by injecting rapidly hardening latex into a major diagonal branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Epicardial stimulation over the infarct, as well as proximal or distal to it, produced compound action potentials that conducted at normal velocities for at least 12 h postinfarction. The transmural extent of the infarct was verified with tetrazolium blue staining at the end of the experiment. In the other four dogs, compound action potentials were generated in cardiopulmonary nerves as described above and then ventricular fibrillation was produced to assess the effects of global anoxia on the function of axons coursing in cardiac nerves. Following the onset of ventricular fibrillation, compound action potentials were generated in these nerves in C fibers for up to 2 h, in B fibers for up to 4 h, and in A fibers for at least 12 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Major untoward events, such as life-threatening arrhythmias and acute coronary events, have been suggested to be triggered by the activation of the autonomic nervous system in patients with coronary artery disease. Analysis of heart rate variability by conventional time and frequency domain methods, as well as by newer methods derived from nonlinear system theory, has offered a novel approach for studying the abnormalities in cardiovascular neural regulation in ischemic heart disease. Heart rate variability has been shown to be altered among patients with ischemic heart disease as compared to their age-matched controls without the evidence of ischemic heart disease. There are also obvious differences in various measures of heart rate variability between patients with uncomplicated coronary artery disease and those with coronary artery disease with complicated myocardial infarction. Impaired high-frequency oscillations of heart rate is the most prominent feature in patients with uncomplicated coronary artery disease, suggesting mainly an impairment in vagal autonomic regulation. Patients with prior myocardial infarction have a reduced overall heart rate variability, and a specific spectral pattern with a reduced low-frequency spectral component has been observed in patients with prior myocardial infarction and impaired left ventricular function. Recent studies have shown that the new nonlinear measures, particularly fractal analysis methods of heart rate dynamics, can detect subtle changes in heart rate behavior that are not easily detected by traditional analysis methods from ambulatory recordings. Patients with prior myocardial infarction have steeper power-law slope analyzed from the ultra and very low-frequency spectral bands, and they also have more random short-term heart rate dynamics analyzed by the detrended fluctuation method. A large body of data indicate that reduced overall heart rate variability is associated with an increased risk of mortality and nonfatal cardiac events in patient with ischemic heart disease. Of particular note, recent studies indicate that fractal analysis methods perform even better than the traditional analysis methods of heart rate variability as predictors of death and the onset of life-threatening arrhythmic events in post-infarction populations. These findings support the notion that heart rate variability analysis methods, such as fractal and complexity measures as well as conventional techniques, give valuable clinical information among patients with ischemic heart disease.

abstract = {The shorter term beat-to-beat heart rate data collected from the general population are often interrupted by artifacts, and an arbitrary exclusion of such individuals from analysis may significantly reduce the sample size and/or introduce selection bias. A computer algorithm was developed to label as artifacts any data points outside the upper and lower limits generated by a 5-beat moving average ±25% (or set manually by an operator using a mouse) and to impute beat-to-beat heart rate throughout an artifact period to preserve the timing relationships of the adjacent, uncorrupted heart rate data. The algorithm applies Fast Fourier Transformation to the smoothed data to estimate low-frequency (LF; 0.025-0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (HF; 0.16-0.35 Hz) spectral powers and the HF/LF ratio as conventional indices of sympathetic, vagal, and vagal-sympathetic balance components, respectively. We applied this algorithm to resting, supine, 2-min beat-to-beat heart rate data collected in the population-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study to assess the performance (success rate) of the algorithm (N = 526) and the inter- and intra-data-operator repeatability of using this computer algorithm (N = 108). Eighty-eight percent (88%) of the records could be smoothed by the computer-generated limits, an additional 4.8% by manually set limits, and 7.4% of the data could not be processed due to a large number of artifacts in the beginning or the end of the records. For the repeatability study, 108 records were selected at random, and two trained data operators applied this algorithm to the same records twice within a 6-month interval of each process (blinded to each other's results and their own prior results). The inter-data-operator reliability coefficients were 0.86, 0.92, and 0.90 for the HF, LF, and HF/LF components, respectively. The average intra-data-operator reliability coefficients were 0.99, 0.99, and 0.98 for the HF, LF, and HF/LF components, respectively. These results indicate that this computer algorithm is efficient and highly repeatable in processing short-term beat-to-beat heart rate data collected from the general population, given that the data operators are trained according to standardized protocol.},

abstract = {Previous studies have suggested benefits of applying fractal analysis to intervals between R waves in electrocardiography as an additional prognostic marker. The aim of this study was to investigate whether fractal analysis can provide an independent predictor of cardiac mortality or all-cause mortality. Prognostic cohort studies reporting fractal heart rate variability results from 24-h Holter monitor recordings were selected for comparison. Populations were subdivided into four groups—post-myocardial infarction, left ventricular dysfunction, other cardiac, and non-cardiac patients—and analysed using ANOVA, Forest plots (using pooled mean difference), and Funnel plots. The most significant mean differences were recorded in short-term fractal self-similarity ($\alpha$1) (−0.17, 95% CI [−0.21, −0.13], p<0.00001) and the traditional measure called standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN) (−13.31, 95% CI [−18.89, −7.73], p<0.00001) between the deceased and survivor groups. Fractal measures of long-term fractal self-similarity ($\alpha$2), 1/f scaling ($\beta$), and tradi- tional heart rate variability measures of high frequency to low frequency ratio show promise. This review indicated that fractal measure $\alpha$1 and traditional measure SDNN could be potential predictors of mortality, but require further assessment to determine appropriate thresholds for clinical signifi- cance and additional targeted prognostic studies to properly define their applicability as prognostic markers. Therefore, clinicians should interpret fractal and traditional measures with caution since such measures have yet to be fully described as biomarkers for clinical application.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND\nCentral venous catheters are devices used for therapeutic, diagnostic, and monitoring purposes. Complications associated with central venous catheter use include those related to their insertion, rupture and displacement of the catheter, occlusion, thrombosis, and infection. Of these the latter is important due to the high morbidity and mortality it causes in the patients, and total parenteral nutrition increases the risk. The aim of this study is determine the incidence and risk factors associated with catheter-related infection in patients on parenteral nutrition. \n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nA retrospective, observational, and cross-sectional study was conducted, by analysing patients on total parenteral nutrition who developed a catheter-related infection in a 6-month period. Multiple variables were studied, looking for significance. A statistically significant relationship was considered with a p<0.05. \n\nRESULTS\nThe study consisted of 85 patients, of whom 52% were women and 48% men. The median age was 54 years. The most frequent diagnosis was enterocutaneous fistula. Catheter associated infection was present in 19% of patients. The most frequent microorganisms found were Staphyloccocus sp. (44%) and Candida sp. (25%). Median time between central venous catheter insertion and infection was 78±64 days. There was a significance between days with a central venous catheters and infection development (p=0.014). Infection developed in 81% of patients on whom surgery was performed (p<0.05). \n\nCONCLUSION\nIt was found that patients with a longer use of a central venous catheter (p=0.014) and those who were operated on in conjunction with total parenteral nutrition (p<0.05) were more prone to develop a catheter-associated infection. \n\nANTECEDENTES\nLos cat{\'{e}}teres vasculares centrales son dispositivos que permiten el acceso al torrente sangu{\'{i}}neo con fines diagn{\'{o}}sticos, terap{\'{e}}uticos y de monitorizaci{\'{o}}n.

Indeed, the term “heart rate variability” yields nearly 18,000 “hits” when placed in the pubmed search engine. These temporal fluctuations in heart rate exhibit a marked synchrony with respiration (increasing during inspiration and decreasing during expiration—the so called respiratory sinus arrhythmia) and are widely believed to reflect changes in cardiac autonomic regulation (Billman, 2011). Although the exact contributions of the parasympathetic and the sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system to this variability are controversial and remain the subject of active investigation and debate, a number of time and frequency domain techniques have been developed to provide insight into cardiac autonomic regulation in both health and disease (Billman, 2011). It is the purpose of this book to provide a comprehensive assessment of the strengths and limitations of HRV techniques. Particular emphasis will be placed on the application of HRV techniques in the clinic and on the interaction between prevailing heart rate and HRV. This book contains both state-of-the art review and original research articles that have been grouped into two main sections: Methodological Considerations and Clinical Application.

An extensive search of the literature yielded 2020 titles and abstracts, of which 172 provided sufficient reporting of sex difference in HRV. Data from 63,612 participants (31,970 females) were available for analysis. Meta-analysis yielded a total of 1154 effect size estimates (k) across 50 different measures of HRV in a cumulated total of 296,247 participants. Females showed a significantly lower mean RR interval and standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN). The power spectral density of HRV in females is characterized by significantly less total power that contains significantly greater high- (HF) and less low-frequency (LF) power. This is further reflected by a lower LF/HF ratio. Meta-regression revealed significant effects of age, respiration control and the length of recording available for analysis. Although women showed greater mean heart rate, they showed greater vagal activity indexed by HF power of HRV. Underlying mechanisms of these findings are discussed.},

abstract = {The population's aging underscores the need to understand the process and define the physiologic markers predictive of healthy longevity. The findings that aging is associated with a progressive decrease in heart rate variability (HRV), an index of autonomic function, suggests that longevity might depend on preservation of autonomic function. However, little is known about late life changes. We assessed the relation between autonomic function and longevity by a cross-sectional study of HRV of 344 healthy subjects, 10 to 99 years old. The HRV was determined from 24-hour Holter records, using 4 time domain measures of HRV (the root mean square of the successive normal sinus RR interval difference [rMSSD], percentage of successive normal sinus RR intervals >50 ms [pNN50], standard deviation of all normal sinus RR intervals during a 24-hour period [SDNN], and standard deviation of the averaged normal sinus RR intervals for all 5-minute segments [SDANN]). Autonomic modulation of the 4 measures differs, permitting distinctions between changes in HRV-parasympathetic function, using rMSSD and pNN50, and HRV-sympathetic function using SDNN and SDANN. Decade values were compared using analysis of variance and t-multiple comparison testing. The HRV of all measures decreases rapidly from the second to fifth decades. It then slows. The HRV-sympathetic function continues to decrease throughout life. In contrast, the decrease in HRV-parasympathetic function reaches its nadir in the eighth decade, followed by reversal and a progressive increase to higher levels (p <0.05), more characteristic of a younger population. In conclusion, healthy longevity depends on preservation of autonomic function, in particular, HRV-parasympathetic function, despite the early age-related decrease. The eighth decade reversal of the decrease in HRV-parasympathetic function and its subsequent increase are key determinants of longevity. Persistently high HRV in the elderly represents a marker predictive of longevity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

However, it was not until the invention of the "Physician's Pulse Watch" (a watch with a second hand that could be stopped) in 1707 that changes in pulse rate could be accurately assessed. The Rev. Stephen Hales (1733) was the first to note that pulse varied with respiration and in 1847 Carl Ludwig was the first to record RSA. With the measurement of the ECG (1895) and advent of digital signal processing techniques in the 1960s, investigation of HRV and its relationship to health and disease has exploded. This essay will conclude with a brief description of time domain, frequency domain, and non-linear dynamic analysis techniques (and their limitations) that are commonly used to measure HRV.},

abstract = {Power spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) has been used to indicate cardiac autonomic function. High-frequency power relates to respiratory sinus arrhythmia and therefore to parasympathetic cardiovagal tone; however, the relationship of low-frequency (LF) power to cardiac sympathetic innervation and function has been controversial. Alternatively, LF power might reflect baro reflexive modulation of autonomic outflows. We studied normal volunteers and chronic autonomic failure syndrome patients with and without loss of cardiac noradrenergic nerves to examine the relationships of LF power with cardiac sympathetic innervation and baroreflex function. We compared LF power of HRV in patients with cardiac sympathetic denervation, as indicated by low myocardial concentrations of 6-[F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity or low rates of norepinephrine entry into coronary sinus plasma (cardiac norepinephrine spillover) to values in patients with intact innervation, at baseline, during infusion of yohimbine, which increases exocytotic norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves, or during infusion of tyramine, which increases non-exocytotic release. Baroreflex-cardiovagal slope (BRS) was calculated from the cardiac interbeat interval and systolic pressure during the Valsalva maneuver. LF power was unrelated to myocardial 6-[F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity or cardiac norepinephrine spillover. In contrast, the log of LF power correlated positively with the log of BRS (r = 0.72, < 0.0001). Patients with a low BRS (‚{\^{a}}{\S}3 msec/mm Hg) had low LF power, regardless of cardiac innervation. Tyramine and yohimbine increased LF power in subjects with normal BRS but not in those with low BRS. BRS at baseline predicted LF responses to tyramine and yohimbine. LF power reflects baroreflex function, not cardiac sympathetic innervation.},

abstract = {Alterations of the baroreceptor-heart rate reflex (baroreflex sensitivity, BRS) contribute to the reciprocal reduction of parasympathetic activity and increase of sympathetic activity that accompany the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the measurement of the baroreflex is a source of valuable information in the clinical management of cardiac disease patients, particularly in risk stratification. This article briefly recalls the pathophysiological background of baroreflex control, and reviews the most relevant methods that have been developed so far for the measurement of BRS. They include three "classic" methods: (i) the use of vasoactive drugs, particularly the alpha-adrenoreceptor agonist phenylephrine, (ii) the Valsalva maneuver, which produces a natural challenge for the baroreceptors by voluntarily increasing intrathoracic and abdominal pressure through straining, and (iii) the neck chamber technique, which allows a selective activation/deactivation of carotid baroreceptors by application of a negative/positive pressure to the neck region. Two more recent methods based on the analysis of spontaneous oscillations of systolic arterial pressure and RR interval are also reviewed: (i) the sequence method, which analyzes the relationship between increasing/decreasing ramps of blood pressure and related increasing/decreasing changes in RR interval through linear regression, and (ii) spectral methods, which assess the relationship (in terms of gain) between specific oscillatory components of the two signals. The limitations of the coherence criterion for the computation of spectral BRS are discussed, and recent proposals for overcoming them are presented. Most relevant clinical applications of BRS measurement are finally reviewed with particular reference to patients with myocardial infarction and heart failure.},

abstract = {The low-frequency component of the heart rate variability spectrum (0.06-0.10 Hz) is often used as an accurate reflection of sympathetic activity. Therefore, interventions that enhance cardiac sympathetic drive, e.g., exercise and myocardial ischemia, should elicit increases in the low-frequency power. Furthermore, because an enhanced sympathetic activation has been linked to an increased propensity for malignant arrhythmias, one might also predict a greater low-frequency power in animals that are susceptible to ventricular fibrillation than in resistant animals. To test these hypotheses, a 2-min coronary occlusion was made during the last minute of exercise in 71 dogs with healed myocardial infarctions: 43 had ventricular fibrillation (susceptible) and 28 did not experience arrhythmias (resistant). Exercise or ischemia alone provoked significant heart rate increases in both groups of animals, with the largest increase in the susceptible animals. These heart rate increases were attenuated by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Despite the sympathetically mediated increases in heart rate, the low-frequency power decreased, rather than increased, in both groups, with the largest decrease again in the susceptible animals: 4.0 +/- 0.2 (susceptible) vs. 4.1 +/- 0.2 ln ms2 (resistant) in preexercise control and 2.2 +/- 0.2 (susceptible) vs. 2.9 +/- 0.2 ln ms2 (resistant) at highest exercise level. In a similar manner the parasympathetic antagonist atropine sulfate elicited significant reductions in the low-frequency power. Although sympathetic nerve activity was not directly recorded, these data suggest that the low-frequency component of the heart rate power spectrum probably results from an interaction of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems and, as such, does not accurately reflect changes in the sympathetic activity.},

abstract = {We studied the neural determinants of the second (i.e., high frequency, HF)- and third-order (i.e., low frequency, LF) spontaneous oscillations of heart period (R-R interval) and arterial pressure (AP) in conscious dogs, with the hypothesis that they might furnish quantitative markers of autonomic controlling activities. Spectral analysis of simultaneous R-R and AP variabilities quantified these oscillations that were also evaluated in units normalized by total power to focus on the balance of these two major components. At rest we observed a prevalent HF component (approximately 0.25 Hz) in R-R and AP variabilities that was synchronous with respiration. This HF component of R-R variability disappeared after atropine infusion and can be considered a marker mostly of vagal activity. When baroreceptor unloading, obtained by moderate hypotension, increased sympathetic activity the LF component increased in R-R, systolic, and diastolic AP variabilities. This increase in LF was not present after ganglionic blockade or after chronic arterial baroreceptor denervation. After chronic bilateral stellectomy, hypotension was not accompanied by an increase in LF component of R-R variability, while LF component remained in AP variability. An increase in LF component of R-R and AP variabilities was observed during transient coronary artery occlusion.},

abstract = {This study analyzed, with spectral techniques, the effects of atenolol or metroprolol on RR interval variability in 20 patients 4 weeks after the first uncomplicated myocardial infarction. Beta blocker-induced bradycardia was associated with a significant increase in the average 24 hour values of RR variance (from 13,886 ± 1,479 to 16,728 ± 1,891 ms2) and of the normalized power of the high-frequency component (from 22 ± 1 to 28 ± 2 normalized units), whereas the low-frequency component was greatly reduced (from 60 ± 3 to 50 ± 3 normalized units). When considering day and nighttime separately, the effects of both drugs were more pronounced in the daytime. In addition, a marked attenuation was observed in the circadian variation of the low-frequency component after $\beta$ blockade. As a result, the early morning increase of the spectral index of sympathetic modulation was no longer detectable. These results indicate that $\beta$-blocker administration has important effects on RR interval variability and on its spectral components. The observed reduction in signs of sympathetic activation and the increase in vagal tone after $\beta$ blockade help to explain the beneficial effects of these drugs after myocardial infarction. However, the potential clinical relevance of the increase in RR variance remains to be established. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Healthy biological systems exhibit complex patterns of variability that can be described by mathematical chaos. Heart rate variability (HRV) consists of changes in the time intervals between consecutive heartbeats called interbeat intervals (IBIs). A healthy heart is not a metronome. The oscillations of a healthy heart are complex and constantly changing, which allow the cardiovascular system to rapidly adjust to sudden physical and psychological challenges to homeostasis. This article briefly reviews current perspectives on the mechanisms that generate 24 h, short-term ($\sim$5 min), and ultra-short-term (<5 min) HRV, the importance of HRV, and its implications for health and performance. The authors provide an overview of widely-used HRV time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear metrics. Time-domain indices quantify the amount of HRV observed during monitoring periods that may range from $\sim$2 min to 24 h. Frequency-domain values calculate the absolute or relative amount of signal energy within component bands. Non-linear measurements quantify the unpredictability and complexity of a series of IBIs. The authors survey published normative values for clinical, healthy, and optimal performance populations. They stress the importance of measurement context, including recording period length, subject age, and sex, on baseline HRV values. They caution that 24 h, short-term, and ultra-short-term normative values are not interchangeable. They encourage professionals to supplement published norms with findings from their own specialized populations. Finally, the authors provide an overview of HRV assessment strategies for clinical and optimal performance interventions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Power spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) has been used to indicate cardiac autonomic function. High-frequency power relates to respiratory sinus arrhythmia and therefore to parasympathetic cardiovagal tone; however, the relationship of low-frequency (LF) power to cardiac sympathetic innervation and function has been controversial. Alternatively, LF power might reflect baroreflexive modulation of autonomic outflows.\n\nOBJECTIVE: We studied normal volunteers and chronic autonomic failure syndrome patients with and without loss of cardiac noradrenergic nerves to examine the relationships of LF power with cardiac sympathetic innervation and baroreflex function.\n\nMETHODS: We compared LF power of HRV in patients with cardiac sympathetic denervation, as indicated by low myocardial concentrations of 6-[(18)F] fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity or low rates of norepinephrine entry into coronary sinus plasma (cardiac norepinephrine spillover) to values in patients with intact innervation, at baseline, during infusion of yohimbine, which increases exocytotic norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves, or during infusion of tyramine, which increases non-exocytotic release. Baroreflex-cardiovagal slope (BRS) was calculated from the cardiac interbeat interval and systolic pressure during the Valsalva maneuver.\n\nRESULTS: LF power was unrelated to myocardial 6-[(18)F] fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity or cardiac norepinephrine spillover. In contrast, the log of LF power correlated positively with the log of BRS (r=0.72, P <0.0001). Patients with a low BRS (<or=3 msec/mm Hg) had low LF power, regardless of cardiac innervation. Tyramine and yohimbine increased LF power in subjects with normal BRS but not in those with low BRS. BRS at baseline predicted LF responses to tyramine and yohimbine.\n\nCONCLUSION: LF power reflects baroreflex function, not cardiac sympathetic innervation.},

abstract = {The circadian variations of spectral indices of heart rate variability were analyzed in 20 patients 4 weeks after a first and uncomplicated myocardial infarction (MI) and in 20 control subjects. R-R interval and variance showed a characteristic day-night pattern with a significant reduction of the latter parameter in patients after MI (10967 ± 1109 msec2vs 16860 ± 2132 msec2). Control subjects were characterized by a predominance of low-frequency (∼0.1 Hz) component during the day and of high-frequency (∼0.25 Hz) component during the night, which reflected the expected 24-hour pattern of variation of sympathovagal balance. A 24-hour elevation (64 ± 3 normalized units [nu] vs 56 ± 2 nu; p < 0.05) of the low-frequency component and a smaller (23 ± 2 nu vs 32 ± 2 nu; p < 0.05) high-frequency component during the night differentiated patients after MI from subjects. The difference between the two groups was even more evident when the 24-hour sympathovagal balance was assessed with the low frequency/high frequency ratio. Thus spectral analysis of heart rate variability indicates that in patients after MI there is an alteration of neural control mechanisms as indicated by the presence of signs of sympathetic activation and by the attenuation of the nocturnal increase in vagal tone. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Spectral estimates of heart rate variability (HRV) often involve the use of techniques such as the fast Fourier transform (FFT), which require an evenly sampled time series. HRV is calculated from the variations in the beat-to-beat (RR) interval timing of the cardiac cycle which are inherently irregularly spaced in time. In order to produce an evenly sampled time series prior to FFT-based spectral estimation, linear or cubic spline resampling is usually employed. In this paper, by using a realistic artificial RR interval generator, interpolation and resampling is shown to result in consistent over-estimations of the power spectral density (PSD) compared with the theoretical solution. The Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram, a more appropriate spectral estimation technique for unevenly sampled time series that uses only the original data, is shown to provide a superior PSD estimate. Ectopy removal or replacement is shown to be essential regardless of the spectral estimation technique. Resampling and phantom beat replacement is shown to decrease the accuracy of PSD estimation, even at low levels of ectopy or artefact. A linear relationship between the frequency of ectopy/artefact and the error (mean and variance) of the PSD estimate is demonstrated. Comparisons of PSD estimation techniques performed on real RR interval data during minimally active segments (sleep) demonstrate that the LS periodogram provides a less noisy spectral estimate of HRV.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although heart rate variability (HRV) at 0.1 Hz has been proposed as a noninvasive clinical measure of cardiac sympathetic nerve firing, this premise has not been sufficiently validated by comparison with techniques such as microneurography and the measurement of norepinephrine spillover from the heart that more directly reflect presynaptic sympathetic activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared the three techniques under conditions of effective cardiac sympathetic denervation, pure autonomic failure (n = 4), dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency (n = 1), and after cardiac transplantation (n = 9) as well as in the context of sympathetic nervous activation in cardiac failure (n = 15) and with aging (n = 10). Age-matched comparisons were made in each case with healthy individuals drawn from a pool of 52 volunteers. In pure autonomic failure and early after transplantation, cardiac norepinephrine spillover was negligible, and HRV was low. Late after transplantation, however, cardiac norepinephrine spillover returned to normal levels, and HRV remained low. In comparison to younger subjects (18 to 35 years old), older individuals (60 to 75 years old) had higher muscle sympathetic nerve activity (young, 22.9 +/- 1.9; old, 31.3 +/- 5.8 bursts per minute; P < .05) and cardiac norepinephrine spillover (young, 14.3 +/- 2.5; old, 20.1 +/- 3.0 ng/min; P < .05). In contrast, total HRV was reduced by 89%, and at 0.1 Hz it was reduced by 93% (P < .05). Cardiac failure was also characterized by elevated cardiac norepinephrine spillover (cardiac failure patients, 59 +/- 4; healthy volunteers, 18 +/- 3 ng/min; P < .01) but reduced 0.1 Hz HRV (cardiac failure patients, 49 +/- 17; healthy volunteers, 243 +/- 4 ms2; P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: HRV at 0.1 Hz depends on factors in addition to cardiac sympathetic nerve firing rates, including multiple neural reflexes, cardiac adrenergic receptor sensitivity, postsynaptic signal transduction, and electrochemical coupling, and is not directly related to cardiac norepinephrine spillover, which is a more direct measure of the sympathetic nerve firing rate.},

abstract = {Accurate measurements of autonomic nerve regulation in heart failure (HF) were unresolved. The discriminating performance of deceleration and acceleration capacities of heart rate in HF was evaluated in 130 HF patients and 212 controls. Acceleration capacity and deceleration capacity were independent risk factors for HF in males, evaluated by multiple logistic regression analysis, with odds ratios (ORs) of 5.94 and 0.13, respectively. Acceleration capacity was also an independent risk factor for HF in females, with an OR of 8.58. Deceleration capacity was the best cardiac electrophysiological index to classify HF in males, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.88. Deceleration capacity was the best classification factor of HF in females with an AUC of 0.97, significantly higher than even left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Acceleration capacity also showed high performance in classifying HF in males (0.84) and females (0.92). The cut-off values of deceleration capacity for HF classification in males and females were 4.55 ms and 4.85 ms, respectively. The cut-off values of acceleration capacity for HF classification in males and females were −6.15 ms and −5.75 ms, respectively. Our study illustrates the role of acceleration and deceleration capacity measurements in the neuro-pathophysiology of HF. Heart failure (HF) refers to structural or functional impairment in the ventricular filling or ejection of blood, which may lead to fluid retention, pulmonary congestion, peripheral edema, and a complex clinical syndrome 1 . HF may be caused by disorders of the myocardium, heart valves, pericardium, and endocardium 2 . Hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and certain metabolic abnormalities are also common etiological factors of HF 3 . HF is a major challenge to public health; in the United States, there are as many as 650,000 new cases diagnosed annually, and this rate has remained stable over the past several decades 4 . The absolute mortality rate for HF is estimated to be $\sim$50% within 5 years of diagnosis 1,5 . The physiological activity of the heart is controlled and modulated by the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems 6,7 . The sympathetic nervous system has a wide variety of cardiovascular actions, including heart rate acceleration, increased cardiac contractility, reduction of venous capacitance, and constriction of resistance vessels 7,8 . The cardiovascular effects of the parasympathetic nervous system (vagus nerve) include heart rate reduction by inhibiting the sympathetic nervous system and by direct hyperpolarization of sinus nodal cells 6,9 . Disorders in parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems of the heart may coexist with serious heart conse-quences, including HF 6,9 . Dysregulation of cardiac adrenergic receptor signaling and transduction will influence cardiac inotropy and is a key feature in HF progression 7,10 . In contrast, the pathophysiological roles of normal and disordered parasympathetic innervation in heart are not as well understood 6–11 . The real-time roles of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems on the heart are difficult to monitor. However, increasing numbers of studies have shown that these roles are reflected in cardiac electro-physiology 6–11 . Heart rate variability (HRV) is the physiological phenomenon of variation in the interval between heart beats, which can be measured and calculated from a continuous electrocardiograph record 12 . In recent decades, time and frequency domain measures of HRV have been considered to represent promising markers of a significant relationship among autonomic nervous system activity, HF, and cardiovascular mortality 12,13 . Although evidence for an association between a propensity for lethal arrhythmias and signs of increased sym-pathetic or reduced vagal activity is abundant, the significance of the many different HRV indexes is more com-plex than generally appreciated, and there is potential for incorrect conclusions and for excessive or unfounded extrapolations 12 . In 2006, Baver et al. established an approach to distinguish between vagal and sympathetic nervous system roles that affect cardiac electrophysiology using a signal processing algorithm to separately characterize the decel-eration and acceleration capacities of the heart rate 14 . The deceleration and acceleration capacities of heart rate were quantified by assessing 24-h ambulatory electrocardiogram recordings 14,15 . The authors found that decreased heart rate deceleration capacity was a powerful predictor of mortality after myocardial infarction, better than left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), conventional measures of HRV, and the combination of the two 14 . Their report advanced cardiac electrophysiological analysis and provided a new approach to quantify the effects of the vagal and sympathetic nervous systems on heart physiology. Although elevated sympathetic activity is associated with an adverse prognosis, and a high level of parasym-pathetic activation confers cardioprotection 6 , a multitude of unknown questions still need to be answered. The parasympathetic actions on the heart are mediated not only by cardiac muscarinic receptor stimulation but also by many known and unknown mechanisms 6 . The role of the vagal nerve in heart biological activity has only recently been investigated in human subjects with HF. Thus, we should consider that any novel approach might advance our knowledge of cardiac nerve electrophysiology. In this report, the significance of acceleration capacity and deceleration in HF was evaluated comprehensively by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and multiple logistic regression analysis together with echocardiographic and HRV indexes under strict statistical quality con-trol. Our data provide new insights into how parasympathetic and sympathetic activation affects HF.},

abstract = {Ovine susceptibility to scrapie is largely controlled by polymorphisms in the PRNP gene. Beginning in 2003, breeding programmes based on the known association between this gene and the susceptibility/resistance status of this disease have been implemented in many European countries. This is not the case in Turkey, where the PRNP gene was not genotyped in native sheep breeds until recently. We sequenced the complete open reading frame of the PRNP gene in 100 sheep belonging to five native Turkish sheep breeds (Akkaraman=21; Morkaraman=20; Tuj=17; Hemsin=23; Karayaka=19). Based on the variability found at codons 136, 154 and 171 (also referred to as standard codons), we determined six alleles VRQ, TRQ, ARR, ARH, ARK and ARQ. The archetype, ARQ, was the most frequent variant in each of the five breeds (across-breed frequency=0.710), while the second most frequent was the resistance-associated ARR allele (0.140). The susceptible VRQ allele exhibited the lowest frequency (0.015). The AHQ allele was not found in any of the analysed breeds. Beyond variability in the standard codons, we found ten additional amino acid variants (M112T, G127S, G127V, M137T, L141F, H143R, N146S, Y172D, Q189L and V213E), one of which, V213E, has not been previously described to our knowledge. Overall, this report may serve as a complement of previous studies on the genetic background of native Turkish sheep regarding the resistance/susceptibility status to classical and atypical scrapie.},

abstract = {Diminished heart rate variability is associated with high sympathetic tone and an increased mortality rate in heart failure cases. We constructed Poincar{\'{e}} plots of each sinus R-R interval plotted against the subsequent R-R interval from 24-hour Holter recordings of 24 healthy subjects (control group) and 24 patients with heart failure. Every subject in the control group had a comet-shaped Poincar{\'{e}} plot resulting from an increase in beat-to-beat dispersion as heart rate slowed. No patient with heart failure had this comet-shaped pattern. Instead, three distinctive patterns were identified: (1) a torpedo-shaped pattern resulting from low R-R interval dispersion over the entire range of heart rates, (2) a fanshaped pattern resulting from restriction of overall R-R interval ranges with enhanced dispersion, and (3) complex patterns with clusters of points characteristic of stepwise changes in R-R intervals. Poincar{\'{e}} pattern could not be predicted from standard deviations of R-R intervals. This first use of Poincar{\'{e}} plots in heart rate variability analysis reveals a complexity not readily perceived from standard deviation information. Further study is warranted to determine if this method will allow refined assessment of cardiac-autonomic integrity in heart failure, which could help identify patients at highest risk for sudden death. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {In the fall of 1983, 322 western calves, in five different groups, were bled on arrival at two Ontario feedlots. Calves receiving treatment for respiratory disease, within 35 days of arrival, were denoted as cases. The hematology and serum chemistry parameters of cases were compared to those of controls. Cases had significantly (p less than 0.05) lower hematocrits, fewer platelets, and more band cells on arrival, than did controls. Cases also had lower serum phosphorous, magnesium, potassium, iron and alkaline phosphatase levels, and increased bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase levels relative to controls. Based on the results of multivariable logistic regression, hematocrit, platelet numbers, serum phosphorous, iron and aspartate aminotransferase levels were the most significant parameters for the prediction of respiratory disease. Reference values for stressed feedlot calves were created. Most parameters were distributed in an approximately normal manner, however the group to group variation in most parameters was significant.},

abstract = {We evaluated a method of baroreflex testing involving sequential intravenous bolus injections of nitroprusside followed by phenylephrine and phenylephrine followed by nitroprusside in 18 healthy men and women, and we drew inferences regarding human sympathetic and vagal baroreflex mechanisms. We recorded the electrocardiogram, photoplethysmographic finger arterial pressure, and peroneal nerve muscle sympathetic activity. We then contrasted least squares linear regression slopes derived from the depressor (nitroprusside) and pressor (phenylephrine) phases with 1) slopes derived from spontaneous fluctuations of systolic arterial pressures and R-R intervals, and 2) baroreflex gain derived from cross-spectral analyses of systolic pressures and R-R intervals. We calculated sympathetic baroreflex gain from integrated muscle sympathetic nerve activity and diastolic pressures. We found that vagal baroreflex slopes are less when arterial pressures are falling than when they are rising and that this hysteresis exists over pressure ranges both below and above baseline levels. Although pharmacological and spontaneous vagal baroreflex responses correlate closely, pharmacological baroreflex slopes tend to be lower than those derived from spontaneous fluctuations. Sympathetic baroreflex slopes are similar when arterial pressure is falling and rising; however, small pressure elevations above baseline silence sympathetic motoneurons. Vagal, but not sympathetic baroreflex gains vary inversely with subjects' ages and their baseline arterial pressures. There is no correlation between sympathetic and vagal baroreflex gains. We recommend repeated sequential nitroprusside followed by phenylephrine doses as a simple, efficientmeans to provoke and characterize human vagal and sympathetic baroreflex responses.},

abstract = {AIM To investigate whether uncomplicated chronic coronary artery disease causes changes in heart rate variability and if so, whether the heart rate variability pattern is different from that described in patients with acute myocardial infarction. METHODS Heart rate variability was studied in 65 patients with angina who had no previous myocardial infarcts, no other diseases, and were on no drug that could influence the sinus node. Results were compared with 33 age matched healthy subjects. The diagnosis of coronary artery disease in angina patients was established by coronary angiography in 58, by thallium scintigraphy in six, and by exercise test only in one. Patients and controls were Holter monitored 24 hours outside hospital, and heart rate variability was calculated in the frequency domain as global power (GP: 0.01-1.00 Hz), low frequency peak (LF: 0. 04-0.15 Hz), high frequency peak (HF: 0.15-0.40 Hz), LF/HF in ms(2), and in the time domain as SDNN (SD of normal RR intervals), SDANN (SD of all five minute mean normal RR intervals), SD (mean of all five minute SDs of mean RR intervals), rMSSD (root mean square of differences of successive normal RR intervals) (all in ms), and pNN50 (proportion of adjacent normal RR intervals differing more than 50 ms from the preceding RR interval) as per cent. RESULTS The mean age in patients and controls was 60.4 (range 32-81) and 59.1 (32-77) years, respectively (NS), the male/female ratio, 57/65 and 24/33 (NS), and the mean time of Holter monitoring, 23.0 (18-24) and 22.8 (18-24) hours (NS). Mortality in angina patients was 0% (0/65) at one year, 0% (0/56) at two years, and 3% (1/33) at three years. Compared with healthy subjects angina patients showed a reduction in GP (p = 0.007), HF (p = 0.02), LF (p = 0.02), SD (p = 0.02), rMSSD (p = 0.01), and pNN50 (p = 0.01). No significant difference was found in RR, LF/HF, SDNN, or SDANN. CONCLUSIONS Uncomplicated coronary artery disease without previous acute myocardial infarction was associated with reduced high and low frequency heart rate variability, including vagal tone. SDANN and SDNN, expressing ultra low and very low frequencies which are known to reflect prognosis after acute myocardial infarction, were less affected. This is in agreement with the good prognosis in uncomplicated angina in this study.},
