abstract = {Background Impaired contractility is a feature of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. We assessed the pharmacokinetics and effects on cardiac function and structure of the cardiac myosin activator, omecamtiv mecarbil. Methods In this randomised, double-blind study, done at 87 sites in 13 countries, we recruited patients with stable, symptomatic chronic heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction 40{\%} or lower. Patients were randomly assigned equally, via an interactive web response system, to receive 25 mg oral omecamtiv mecarbil twice daily (fixed-dose group), 25 mg twice daily titrated to 50 mg twice daily guided by pharmacokinetics (pharmacokinetic-titration group), or placebo for 20 weeks. We assessed the maximum concentration of omecamtiv mecarbil in plasma (primary endpoint) and changes in cardiac function and ventricular diameters. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01786512. Findings From March 17, 2014, to March 5, 2015, we enrolled 150 patients in the fixed-dose omecamtiv mecarbil group and 149 in the pharmacokinetic-titration and placebo groups. Mean maximum concentration of omecamtiv mecarbil at 12 weeks was 200 (SD 71) ng/mL in the fixed-dose group and 318 (129) ng/mL in the pharmacokinetic-titration group. For the pharmacokinetic-titration group versus placebo group at 20 weeks, least square mean differences were as follows: systolic ejection time 25 ms (95{\%} CI 18–32, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), stroke volume 3{\textperiodcentered}6 mL (0{\textperiodcentered}5–6{\textperiodcentered}7, p=0{\textperiodcentered}0217), left ventricular end-systolic diameter −1{\textperiodcentered}8 mm (−2{\textperiodcentered}9 to −0{\textperiodcentered}6, p=0{\textperiodcentered}0027), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter −1{\textperiodcentered}3 mm, (−2{\textperiodcentered}3 to 0{\textperiodcentered}3, p=0{\textperiodcentered}0128), heart rate −3{\textperiodcentered}0 beats per min (−5{\textperiodcentered}1 to −0{\textperiodcentered}8, p=0{\textperiodcentered}0070), and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide concentration in plasma −970 pg/mL (−1672 to −268, p=0{\textperiodcentered}0069). The frequency of adverse clinical events did not differ between groups. Interpretation Omecamtiv mecarbil dosing guided by pharmacokinetics achieved plasma concentrations associated with improved cardiac function and decreased ventricular diameter. Funding Amgen.},

abstract = {Context: Because acute decompensated heart failure causes substantial morbidity and mortality, there is a need for agents that at least improve hemodynamics and relieve symptoms without adversely affecting survival. Objective: To assess the effect of a short-term intravenous infusion of levosimendan or dobutamine on long-term survival. Design, Setting, and Patients: The Survival of Patients With Acute Heart Failure in Need of Intravenous Inotropic Support (SURVIVE) study was a randomized, double-blind trial comparing the efficacy and safety of intravenous levosimendan or dobutamine in 1327 patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure who required inotropic support. The trial was conducted at 75 centers in 9 countries and patients were randomized between March 2003 and December 2004. Interventions: Intravenous levosimendan (n=664) or intravenous dobutamine (n=663). Main Outcome Measure: All-cause mortality at 180 days. Results: All-cause mortality at 180 days occurred in 173 (26{\%}) patients in the levosimendan group and 185 (28{\%}) patients in the dobutamine group (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.74-1.13; P=.40). The levosimendan group had greater decreases in B-type natriuretic peptide level at 24 hours that persisted through 5 days compared with the dobutamine group (P{\textless}.001 for all time points). There were no statistical differences between treatment groups for the other secondary end points (all-cause mortality at 31 days, number of days alive and out of the hospital, patient global assessment, patient assessment of dyspnea at 24 hours, and cardiovascular mortality at 180 days). There was a higher incidence of cardiac failure in the dobutamine group. There were higher incidences of atrial fibrillation, hypokalemia, and headache in the levosimendan group. Conclusion: Despite an initial reduction in plasma B-type natriuretic peptide level in patients in the levosimendan group compared with patients in the dobutamine group, levosimendan did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality at 180 days or affect any secondary clinical outcomes.

abstract = {Background Omecamtiv mecarbil (OM) is a selective cardiac myosin activator that increases myocardial function in healthy volunteers and in patients with chronic heart failure. Objectives This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, tolerability, safety, and efficacy of OM in patients with acute heart failure (AHF). Methods Patients admitted for AHF with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40{\%}, dyspnea, and elevated plasma concentrations of natriuretic peptides were randomized to receive a double-blind, 48-h intravenous infusion of placebo or OM in 3 sequential, escalating-dose cohorts. Results In 606 patients, OM did not improve the primary endpoint of dyspnea relief (3 OM dose groups and pooled placebo: placebo, 41{\%}; OM cohort 1, 42{\%}; cohort 2, 47{\%}; cohort 3, 51{\%}; p = 0.33) or any of the secondary outcomes studied. In supplemental, pre-specified analyses, OM resulted in greater dyspnea relief at 48 h (placebo, 37{\%} vs. OM, 51{\%}; p = 0.034) and through 5 days (p = 0.038) in the high-dose cohort. OM exerted plasma concentration-related increases in left ventricular systolic ejection time (p {\textless} 0.0001) and decreases in end-systolic dimension (p {\textless} 0.05). The adverse event profile and tolerability of OM were similar to those of placebo, without increases in ventricular or supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Plasma troponin concentrations were higher in OM-treated patients compared with placebo (median difference at 48 h, 0.004 ng/ml), but with no obvious relationship with OM concentration (p = 0.95). Conclusions In patients with AHF, intravenous OM did not meet the primary endpoint of dyspnea improvement, but it was generally well tolerated, it increased systolic ejection time, and it may have improved dyspnea in the high-dose group.

@article{Follath2002,
abstract = {Background: Levosimendan, a novel calcium sensitiser, improves myocardial contractility without causing an increase in myocardial oxygen demand. We compared the effects of levosimendan and dobutamine on haemodynamic performance and clinical outcome in patients with low-output heart failure. Methods: Patients were recruited into a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group trial. Under continuous haemodynamic monitoring, an initial loading dose of levosimendan of 24 $\mu$g/kg was infused over 10 min, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1 $\mu$gkg-1 min-1 for 24 h. Dobutamine was infused for 24 h at an initial dose of 5 $\mu$g kg-1 min-1 without a loading dose. The infusion rate was doubled if the response was inadequate at 2h. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with haemodynamic improvement (defined as an increase of 30{\%} or more in cardiac output and a decrease of 25{\%} or more in pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure) at 24 h. Analyses were by intention to treat. Findings: 103 patients were assigned levosimendan and 100 dobutamine. The primary haemodynamic endpoint was achieved in 29 (28{\%}) levosimendan-group patients and 15 (15{\%}) in the dobutamine group (hazard ratio 1.9 [95{\%} CI 1.1-3.3]; p=0.022). At 180 days, 27 (26{\%}) levosimendan-group patients had died, compared with 38 (38{\%}) in the dobutamine group (0.57 [0.34-0.95]; p=0.029). Interpretation: In patients with severe, low-output heart failure, levosimendan improved haemodynamic performance more effectively than dobutamine. This benefit was accompanied by lower mortality in the levosimendan group than in the dobutamine group for up to 180 days.},

@article{Hershberger2003,
abstract = {Background: This study describes the process and outcomes of continuous outpatient support with inotropes (COSI) in patients with Stage D heart failure (HF). Although Stage D HF has recently been defined as end-stage disease requiring special interventions for survival such as COSI or ventricular assist devices, concern has been raised regarding the safety, efficacy, mortality outcomes, and ethics of COSI. Methods and Results: Inotrope dependence was defined as worsening of the patient's clinical status with attempted inotrope withdrawal such that the patient was deemed unlikely to survive to permit hospital discharge. A care process for COSI was designed; baseline and outcome variables were evaluated. COSI was administered to 36 inotrope-dependent patients (age 55.4 ± 9.5 years, 24 males). Baseline characteristics (mean ± SD) were consistent with Stage D HF: left ventricular ejection fraction 19.9 ± 8.5, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD) 70 ± 10 mm, systolic blood pressure 97.4 ± 13.4 mm Hg, serum creatinine 1.5 ± 0.6, serum sodium 131.7 ± 5.3; 69 HF hospitalizations (mean 1.9 ± 1.8) 6 months before COSI initiation. Symptomatic hypotension, increasing dyspnea, renal dysfunction, and hypoperfusion most commonly prevented inotrope withdrawal. Despite Stage D HF, patients were discharged with COSI ambulatory, oriented, and pain free. Rehospitalizations were 46; 6 subjects accounted for 24 hospitalizations; 23 had 0 or 1 rehospitalization. Median survival was 3.4 months (range 0.2.26.3 months); and 3-, 6-, and 12-month Kaplan Meier survival was 51{\%}, 26{\%}, and 6{\%}, respectively. The majority of patients died at home and chose to not undergo resuscitation attempts. Conclusion: COSI may be an acceptable treatment option for Stage D HF.},
