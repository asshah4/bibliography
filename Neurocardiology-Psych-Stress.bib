abstract = {This concept-based review provides historical perspectives and updates about sympathetic noradrenergic and sympathetic adrenergic responses to mental stress. The topic of this review has incited perennial debate, because of disagreements over definitions, controversial inferences, and limited availability of relevant measurement tools. The discussion begins appropriately with Cannon's "homeostasis" and his pioneering work in the area. This is followed by mental stress as a scientific idea and the relatively new notions of allostasis and allostatic load. Experimental models of mental stress in rodents and humans are discussed, with particular attention to ethical constraints in humans. Sections follow on sympathoneural responses to mental stress, reactivity of catecholamine systems, clinical pathophysiologic states, and the cardiovascular reactivity hypothesis. Future advancement of the field will require integrative approaches and coordinated efforts between physiologists and psychologists on this interdisciplinary topic.},

abstract = {Mental stress-induced ischemia approximately doubles the risk of cardiac events in patients with coronary artery disease, yet the mechanisms underlying changes in coronary blood flow in response to mental stress are poorly characterized. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) regulates basal coronary blood flow in healthy humans and mediates mental stress-induced vasodilation in the forearm. However, its possible role in mental stress-induced increases in coronary blood flow is unknown. We studied 11 patients (6 men and 5 women, mean age: 58 ± 14 yr) undergoing elective diagnostic cardiac catheterization and assessed the vasodilator response to mental stress elicited by the Stroop color-word test. Intracoronary substance P (20 pmol/min) and isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg) were used to assess endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation, respectively. Coronary blood flow was estimated using intracoronary Doppler recordings and quantitative coronary angiography to measure coronary artery diameter. Mental stress increased coronary flow by 34 ± 7.0{\%} over the preceding baseline during saline infusion (P {\textless} 0.01), and this was reduced to 26 ± 7.0{\%} in the presence of the selective nNOS inhibitor S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline (0.625 µmol/min, P {\textless} 0.001). Mental stress increased coronary artery diameter by 6.9 ± 3.7{\%} (P = 0.02) and 0.5 ± 2.8{\%} (P = 0.51) in the presence of S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline. The response to substance P did not predict the response to mental stress (r(2) = -0.22, P = 0.83). nNOS mediates the human coronary vasodilator response to mental stress, predominantly through actions at the level of coronary resistance vessels.NEW {\&} NOTEWORTHY Acute mental stress induces vasodilation of the coronary microvasculature.

abstract = {Mental stress testing has been proposed as a noninvasive tool to evaluate endothelium-dependent coronary vasomotion. In patients with coronary artery disease, mental stress can induce myocardial ischemia. However, even the determinants of the physiological myocardial blood flow (MBF) response to mental stress are poorly understood. Twenty-four individuals (12 males/12 females, mean age 49 +/- 13 yr, range 31-74 yr) with a low likelihood for coronary artery disease were studied. Serum catecholamines, cardiac work, and MBF (measured quantitatively with N-13 ammonia and positron emission tomography) were assessed. During mental stress (arithmetic calculation) MBF increased significantly from 0.70 +/- 0.14 to 0.92 +/- 0.21 ml x min(-1) x g(-1) (P {\textless} 0.01). Mental stress caused significant increases (P {\textless} 0.01) in serum epinephrine (26 +/- 16 vs. 42 +/- 17 pg/ml), norepinephrine (272 +/- 139 vs. 322 +/- 136 pg/ml), and cardiac work [rate-pressure product (RPP) 8,011 +/- 1,884 vs. 10,416 +/- 2,711]. Stress-induced changes in cardiac work were correlated with changes in MBF (r = 0.72; P {\textless} 0.01). Multiple-regression analysis revealed stress-induced changes in the RPP as the only significant (P = 0.0001) predictor for the magnitude of mental stress-induced increases in MBF in healthy individuals. Data from this group of healthy individuals should prove useful to investigate coronary vasomotion in individuals at risk for or with documented coronary artery disease.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is commonly used as a quantitative marker depicting the activity of autonomous nervous system (ANS) that may be related to mental stress. For mobile applications, short term ECG measurement may be used for HRV analysis since the conventional five minute long recordings might be inadequately long. Short term analysis of HRV features has been investigated mostly in ECG data from normal and cardiac patients. Thus, short term HRV features may not have any relevance on the assessment of acute mental stress. In this study, we obtained ultra short term HRV features from 24 subjects during baseline stage and Stroop color word test. We validated these HRV features by showing significant differences in HRV features existed between the two stages. Our results indicated that ultra short term analysis of heart rate and RR intervals within 10 s, RMSSD and PNN50 within 30 s, HF within 40 s, LF/HF, normalized LF, and normalized HF within 50 s could be reliably performed for monitoring mental stress in mobile settings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is frequent in patients with coronary artery disease and is associated with worse prognosis. Young women with a previous myocardial infarction (MI), a group with unexplained higher mortality than men of comparable age, have shown elevated rates of MSIMI, but the mechanisms are unknown. METHODS We studied 306 patients (150 women and 156 men) ≤61 years of age who were hospitalized for MI in the previous 8 months and 112 community controls (58 women and 54 men) frequency matched for sex and age to the patients with MI. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation and microvascular reactivity (reactive hyperemia index) were measured at rest and 30 minutes after mental stress. The digital vasomotor response to mental stress was assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry. Patients received 99mTc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest, with mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) stress. RESULTS The mean age of the sample was 50 years (range, 22-61). In the MI group but not among controls, women had a more adverse socioeconomic and psychosocial profile than men. There were no sex differences in cardiovascular risk factors, and among patients with MI, clinical severity tended to be lower in women. Women in both groups showed a higher peripheral arterial tonometry ratio during mental stress but a lower reactive hyperemia index after mental stress, indicating enhanced microvascular dysfunction after stress. There were no sex differences in flow-mediated dilation changes with mental stress. The rate of MSIMI was twice as high in women as in men (22{\%} versus 11{\%}, P=0.009), and ischemia with conventional stress was similarly elevated (31{\%} versus 16{\%}, P=0.002). Psychosocial and clinical risk factors did not explain sex differences in inducible ischemia. Although vascular responses to mental stress (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio and reactive hyperemia index) also did not explain sex differences in MSIMI, they were predictive of MSIMI in women only. CONCLUSIONS Young women after MI have a 2-fold likelihood of developing MSIMI compared with men and a similar increase in conventional stress ischemia. Microvascular dysfunction and peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress are implicated in MSIMI among women but not among men, perhaps reflecting women's proclivity toward ischemia because of microcirculatory abnormalities.},

abstract = {Objective Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and despite important advances in our understanding of this disorder, the underlying mechanisms remain under investigation. Recently, increased attention has been placed on the role of behavioral factors such as emotional stress on CAD risk. Brain areas involved in memory and the stress response, including medial prefrontal cortex, insula, and parietal cortex, also have outputs to the peripheral cardiovascular system. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of mental stress on brain and cardiac function in patients with CAD. Methods CAD patients (N = 170) underwent cardiac imaging with [Tc-99m] sestamibi single-photon emission tomography at rest and during a public speaking mental stress task. On another day, they underwent imaging of the brain with [O-15] water positron emission tomography (PET) during mental stress (arithmetic and public speaking) and control conditions. Results Patients with mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia showed increased activation with stress in anterior cingulate, inferior frontal gyrus, and parietal cortex (p {\textless}.005). This was seen with both arithmetic stress and public speaking stress. Arithmetic stress was additionally associated with left insula activation, and public speaking with right pre/postcentral gyrus and middle temporal gyrus activation (p {\textless}.005). Conclusions These findings suggest that mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is associated with activation in brain areas involved in the stress response and autonomic regulation of the cardiovascular system. Altered brain reactivity to stress could possibly represent a mechanism through which stress leads to increased risk of CAD-related morbidity and mortality.},

abstract = {Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) has been associated with adverse prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but whether this is a uniform finding across different studies has not been described. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies examining the association between MSIMI and adverse outcome events in patients with stable CAD. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases for English language prospective studies of patients with CAD who underwent standardized mental stress testing to determine presence of MSIMI and were followed up for subsequent cardiac events or total mortality. Our outcomes of interest were CAD recurrence, CAD mortality, or total mortality. A summary effect estimate was derived using a fixed-effects meta-analysis model. Only 5 studies, each with a sample size of {\textless}200 patients and fewer than 50 outcome events, met the inclusion criteria. The pooled samples comprised 555 patients with CAD (85{\%} male) and 117 events with a range of follow-up from 35 days to 8.8 years. Pooled analysis showed that MSIMI was associated with a twofold increased risk of a combined end point of cardiac events or total mortality (relative risk 2.24, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.59 to 3.15). No heterogeneity was detected among the studies (Q = 0.39, I2= 0.0{\%}, p = 0.98). In conclusion, although few selected studies have examined the association between MSIMI and adverse events in patients with CAD, all existing investigations point to approximately a doubling of risk. Whether this increased risk is generalizable to the CAD population at large and varies in patient subgroups warrant further investigation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED In patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), mental stress may provoke ischemic electrocardiograph changes and abnormalities in regional and global left ventricular function. However, little is known about the underlying myocardial blood flow response (MBF) in these patients. METHODS We investigated the hemodynamic, neurohumoral, and myocardial blood flow responses to mental stress in 17 patients with CAD and 17 healthy volunteers of similar age. Mental stress was induced by asking individuals to solve mathematic subtractions in a progressively challenging sequence; MBF was quantified at rest and during mental stress using 13N ammonia PET. RESULTS Mental stress induced significant (P {\textless} 0.01) and comparable increases in rate-pressure product, measured in beats per minute x mm Hg, in both patients (from 7826 +/- 2006 to 10586 +/- 2800) and healthy volunteers (from 8227 +/- 1272 to 10618 +/- 2468). Comparable increases also occurred in serum epinephrine (58{\%} in patients versus 52{\%} in healthy volunteers) and norepinephrine (22{\%} in patients versus 27{\%} in healthy volunteers). Although MBF increased in patients (from 0.67 +/- 0.15 to 0.77 +/- 0.18 mL/min/g, P {\textless} 0.05) and healthy volunteers (from 0.73 +/- 0.13 to 0.95 +/- 0.22 mL/min/g, P {\textless} 0.001), the magnitude of flow increase was smaller in patients (14{\%} +/- 17{\%}) than in healthy volunteers (29{\%} +/- 14{\%}) (P = 0.01). The increase in MBF during mental stress correlated significantly with changes in cardiac work in healthy volunteers (r = 0.77; P {\textless} 0.001) but not in patients. CONCLUSION Despite similar increases in cardiac work and comparable sympathetic stimulation in CAD patients and healthy volunteers, CAD patients exhibit an attenuated blood flow response to mental stress that may contribute to mental stress-induced ischemic episodes in daily life.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is a common phenomenon in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and an emerging prognostic factor. Mental stress ischemia is correlated with ambulatory ischemia. However, whether it is related to angina symptoms during daily life has not been examined. METHODS: We assessed angina frequency (past month) in 98 post-myocardial infarction (MI) subjects (age 18-60 years) using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. Patients underwent [(99m)Tc]sestamibi SPECT perfusion imaging at rest, after mental stress, and after exercise/pharmacological stress. Summed scores of perfusion abnormalities were obtained by observer-independent software. A summed difference score (SDS), the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. RESULTS: The mean age was 50 years, 50{\%} were female and 60{\%} were non-white. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, CAD severity, depressive, anger, and anxiety symptoms, each 1-point increase in mental stress-SDS was associated with 1.73-unit increase in the angina frequency score (95{\%} CI: 0.09-3.37) and 17{\%} higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.17, 95{\%} CI: 1.00-1.38). Depressive symptoms were associated with 12{\%} higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.12, 95{\%} CI: 1.03-1.21). In contrast, exercise/pharmacological stress-induced SDS was not associated with angina frequency. CONCLUSION: Among young and middle-aged post-MI patients, myocardial ischemia induced by mental stress in the lab, but not by exercise/pharmacological stress, is associated with higher frequency of retrospectively reported angina during the day. Psychosocial stressors related to mental stress ischemia may be important contributory factor to daily angina.},

No significant main effects of group were observed. Overall, our results indicate ‘‘normal'' HRV parameters in patients with PD. The HRV of PD patients is no worse than that of healthy control participants since the HRV profiles were similar between the study groups.

abstract = {A rapidly expanding literature documents the effects of social support on physical and psychological well-being. Although definitions vary, most include both tangible components (e.g., financial assistance and physical aid) and intangible components (e.g., encouragement and guidance). Social support has been implicated in the mediation of stressful life events, recovery from illness, and increased program adherence. There are many inconsistent findings in the literature, however, and it is difficult to resolve discrepancies because measures of social support vary widely from study to study. To guide in the selection of measurement methods for research and applied work, 23 techniques for assessing social support are reviewed and evaluated. Criteria for favorable evaluation included reliability coefficients greater than .8 and documentation of validity. Correlations between various social support and criterion measures are simulated in order to demonstrate the consequences of choosing a measure with low reliability. Scale developers reported reliability data for 19 of the reviewed measures. Internal consistency coefficients ranged from .31 to .98. Test-retest coefficients ranged from .22 to .96. At least some validity documentation was available for 13 of the scales. Discriminant validity evidence, however, is almost universally absent. Despite psychometric weaknesses and variability among the scales, researchers have several instruments available to them.},

We sought to examine whether mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI), but not exercise-induced ischemia, is more common in young women with previous myocardial infarction (MI) than in men.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We studied 98 post-MI patients (49 women and 49 men) aged 38 to 60 years. Women and men were matched for age, MI type, and months since MI. Patients underwent technetium-99m sestamibi perfusion imaging at rest, after mental stress, and after exercise/pharmacological stress. Perfusion defect scores were obtained with observer-independent software. A summed difference score (SDS), the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify ischemia under both stress conditions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Women 50 years or younger, but not older women, showed a more adverse psychosocial profile than did age-matched men but did not differ for conventional risk factors and tended to have less angiographic coronary artery disease. Compared with age-matched men, women 50 years or younger exhibited a higher SDS with mental stress (3.1 versus 1.5, p = .029) and had twice the rate of MSIMI (SDS ≥ 3; 52{\%} versus 25{\%}), whereas ischemia with physical stress did not differ (36{\%} versus 25{\%}). In older patients, there were no sex differences in MSIMI. The higher prevalence of MSIMI in young women persisted when adjusting for sociodemographic and life-style factors, coronary artery disease severity, and depression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: MSIMI post-MI is more common in women 50 years or younger compared with age-matched men. These sex differences are not observed in post-MI patients who are older than 50 years.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is a common phenomenon in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but contemporary studies of its prognostic significance and its underlying pathophysiology are limited. METHODS We prospectively enrolled patients with confirmed CAD in the Mental Stress Ischemia Prognosis Study (MIPS) between 2011 and 2014. All patients underwent mental stress testing using a standardized public speaking task, and ischemia was detected by Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging. Patients also underwent conventional stress testing for myocardial ischemia (CSIMI) using exercise or pharmacological stress testing. Furthermore, digital microvascular flow, endothelial function, arterial stiffness, and blood sample collections were performed before, during, and after mental stress. Two-year adverse clinical outcomes are being assessed. RESULTS Six-hundred ninety-five patients completed baseline enrollment in the MIPS. Their mean (standard deviation) age was 62.9 (9.1) years, 72{\%} were men, 30{\%} were African American, and 32{\%} had a history myocardial infarction. The prevalence of MSIMI and CSIMI is 16.1{\%} and 34.7{\%}, respectively. A total of 151 patients (22.9{\%}) had only CSIMI, 28 (4.2{\%}) had only MSIMI, and 78 (11.8{\%}) had both MSIMI and CSIMI. Patients with ischemia had a lower ejection fraction and higher prevalence of previous coronary artery bypass grafting compared with those without inducible ischemia (p {\textless} .050). The prevalence of obstructive CAD was not statistically different between patients with and without MSIMI (p = .426); in contrast, it was higher in patients with CSIMI (p {\textless} .001). CONCLUSIONS The MIPS data will provide useful information to assess the prognostic significance and underlying mechanisms of MSIMI.},

abstract = {The physiological reaction to psychological stress, involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical and sympatho-adrenomedullary axes, is well characterized, but its link to cardiovascular disease risk is not well understood. Epidemiological data show that chronic stress predicts the occurrence of coronary heart disease (CHD). Employees who experience work-related stress and individuals who are socially isolated or lonely have an increased risk of a first CHD event. In addition, short-term emotional stress can act as a trigger of cardiac events among individuals with advanced atherosclerosis. A stress-specific coronary syndrome, known as transient left ventricular apical ballooning cardiomyopathy or stress (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy, also exists. Among patients with CHD, acute psychological stress has been shown to induce transient myocardial ischemia and long-term stress can increase the risk of recurrent CHD events and mortality. Applications of the 'stress concept' (the understanding of stress as a risk factor and the use of stress management) in the clinical settings have been relatively limited, although the importance of stress management is highlighted in European guidelines for cardiovascular disease prevention. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Background--Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is associated with adverse prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), yet the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. We hypothesized that compared with exercise/pharmacological stress-induced myocardial ischemia (PSIMI) that is secondary to the atherosclerotic burden of CAD, MSIMI is primarily due to vasomotor changes. Methods and Results--Patients with angiographically documented CAD underwent 99mTc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest and following both mental and physical stress testing, performed on separate days. The severity and extent of CAD were quantified using the Gensini and Sullivan scores. Peripheral arterial tonometry (Itamar Inc) was used to assess the digital microvascular tone during mental stress as a ratio of pulse wave amplitude during speech compared with baseline. Measurements were made in a discovery sample (n=225) and verified in a replication sample (n=159). In the pooled (n=384) sample, CAD severity and extent scores were not significantly different between those with and without MSIMI, whereas they were greater in those with compared with those without PSIMI (P {\textless} 0.04 for all). The peripheral arterial tonometry ratio was lower in those with compared with those without MSIMI (0.55±0.36 versus 0.76±0.52, P=0.009). In a multivariable analysis, the peripheral arterial tonometry ratio was the only independent predictor of MSIMI (P=0.009), whereas angiographic severity and extent of CAD independently predicted PSIMI. Conclusions--The degree of digital microvascular constriction, and not the angiographic burden of CAD, is associated with MSIMI. Varying causes of MSIMI compared with PSIMI may require different therapeutic interventions that require further study.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To investigate sex-specific vascular mechanisms for mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI). APPROACH AND RESULTS Baseline data from a prospective cohort study of 678 patients with coronary artery disease underwent myocardial perfusion imaging before and during a public speaking stressor. The rate-pressure product response was calculated as the difference between the maximum value during the speech minus the minimum value during rest. Peripheral vasoconstriction by peripheral arterial tonometry was calculated as the ratio of pulse wave amplitude during the speech over the resting baseline; ratios {\textless}1 indicate a vasoconstrictive response. MSIMI was defined as percent of left ventricle that was ischemic and as a dichotomous variable. Men (but not women) with MSIMI had a higher rate-pressure product response than those without MSIMI (6500 versus 4800 mm Hg bpm), whereas women (but not men) with MSIMI had a significantly lower peripheral arterial tonometry ratio than those without MSIMI (0.5 versus 0.8). In adjusted linear regression, each 1000-U increase in rate-pressure product response was associated with 0.32{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.22-0.42) increase in inducible ischemia among men, whereas each 0.10-U decrease in peripheral arterial tonometry ratio was associated with 0.23{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.11-0.35) increase in inducible myocardial ischemia among women. Results were independent of conventional stress-induced myocardial ischemia. CONCLUSIONS Women and men have distinct cardiovascular reactivity mechanisms for MSIMI. For women, stress-induced peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress, and not increased hemodynamic workload, is associated with MSIMI, whereas for men, it is the opposite. Future studies should examine these pathways on long-term outcomes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute mental stress evokes responses in the cardiovascular and the immune systems. In particular, the subset of natural killer (NK) cells is found to be responsive to mental stress. The role of beta-adrenergic mechanisms in these processes in the subject of this investigation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Healthy male volunteers (n = 31) were subjected to two consecutive mental tasks. Subjects were randomly assigned to a beta-blocker (propranolol 40 mg) or a placebo group. The capsules were ingested 1 hour before the tasks. The tasks evoked sympathetic responses, as indicated by an increase in heart rate and a decrease in the preejection period. These effects were abolished under beta-blockade, indicating that effective beta-blockade was achieved. In the immune system, significant increases were found for the number of NK cells and NK cell activity in the placebo group; these increases were absent in the propranolol group. In addition, an increase in all lymphocyte subsets was observed in subjects who had ingested propranolol. This increase, however, was also observed in subjects who had received propranolol but had not performed the tasks, indicating that these non-subset-specific increases in lymphocytes were a side effect of the beta-blocker. CONCLUSIONS: Mental stress induces activation of the sympathetic nervous system, with concomitant increases in the number of NK cells in the circulation. These changes were inhibited by propranolol, indicating that stress-induced increases in the number and activity of NK cells in the circulation are controlled by a beta-adrenergic mechanism.},

abstract = {Objective: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is a common phenomenon in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and an emerging prognostic factor. Mental stress ischemia is correlated with ambulatory ischemia. However, whether it is related to angina symptoms during daily life has not been examined. Methods: We assessed angina frequency (past month) in 98 post-myocardial infarction (MI) subjects (age 18-60years) using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. Patients underwent [99mTc]sestamibi SPECT perfusion imaging at rest, after mental stress, and after exercise/pharmacological stress. Summed scores of perfusion abnormalities were obtained by observer-independent software. A summed difference score (SDS), the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. Results: The mean age was 50. years, 50{\%} were female and 60{\%} were non-white. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, CAD severity, depressive, anger, and anxiety symptoms, each 1-point increase in mental stress-SDS was associated with 1.73-unit increase in the angina frequency score (95{\%} CI: 0.09-3.37) and 17{\%} higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.17, 95{\%} CI: 1.00-1.38). Depressive symptoms were associated with 12{\%} higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.12, 95{\%} CI: 1.03-1.21). In contrast, exercise/pharmacological stress-induced SDS was not associated with angina frequency. Conclusion: Among young and middle-aged post-MI patients, myocardial ischemia induced by mental stress in the lab, but not by exercise/pharmacological stress, is associated with higher frequency of retrospectively reported angina during the day. Psychosocial stressors related to mental stress ischemia may be important contributory factor to daily angina.},

abstract = {There is growing evidence that psychosocial stress can influence the natural history of coronary heart disease.1 Epidemiological studies indicate that psychosocial factors both contribute to the development of coronary artery disease (CAD), and increase risk of cardiac dysfunction and the likelihood of cardiac events in susceptible patients with established disease.2,3 An important method of assessing effects on cardiac function is by measuring transient ischaemic responses to standardized mental stress tests. Mental stress-induced myocardial ischaemia (MSIMI) is analogous to exercise stress ischaemia, except that the stimulus is psychological rather than physical. MSIMI has been studied with a number of different imaging techniques and with a range of stressful stimuli. But several investigations have involved small numbers of patients, and the medication status of patients has been variable. This has resulted in diverse findings concerning the prevalence of MSIMI, the conditions in which it is elicited, the type of patients who are most susceptible, the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon, and its clinical significance. In an effort to clarify these issues, we have conducted a systematic review of studies in which myocardial ischaemic responses have been measured in response to standardized mental stressors in the laboratory and clinic. Relevant articles were identified from searches of PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed)between 1980 and 2002. Only articles in English language peer-reviewed publications were examined. We included studies that examined the link between standardized mental stress tests and myocardial ischaemic responses. Studies involving patients with CAD and healthy volunteers or patients without CAD were included. To ensure comprehensive data location, further searches were made for authors published in this field and review articles were used as sources. The bibliographies of all papers retrieved were hand searched to ensure as many articles as possible were obtained.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Coronary microvascular dysfunction may contribute to myocardial ischemia during mental stress (MS). However, the role of coronary epicardial and microvascular function in regulating coronary blood flow (CBF) responses during MS remains understudied. We hypothesized that coronary vasomotion during MS is dependent on the coronary microvascular endothelial function and will be reflected in the peripheral microvascular circulation. METHODS AND RESULTS In 38 patients aged 59±8 years undergoing coronary angiography, endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent coronary epicardial and microvascular responses were measured using intracoronary acetylcholine and nitroprusside, respectively, and after MS induced by mental arithmetic testing. Peripheral microvascular tone during MS was measured using peripheral arterial tonometry (Itamar Inc, Caesarea, Israel) as the ratio of digital pulse wave amplitude compared to rest (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio). MS increased the rate-pressure product by 22{\%} (±23{\%}) and constricted epicardial coronary arteries by -5.9{\%} (-10.5{\%}, -2.6{\%}) (median [interquartile range]), P=0.001, without changing CBF. Acetylcholine increased CBF by 38.5{\%} (8.1{\%}, 91.3{\%}), P=0.001, without epicardial coronary diameter change (0.1{\%} [-10.9{\%}, 8.2{\%}], P=not significant). The MS-induced CBF response correlated with endothelium-dependent CBF changes with acetylcholine (r=0.38, P=0.03) but not with the response to nitroprusside. The peripheral arterial tonometry ratio also correlated with the demand-adjusted change in CBF during MS (r=-0.60, P=0.004), indicating similarity between the microcirculatory responses to MS in the coronary and peripheral microcirculation. CONCLUSIONS The coronary microvascular response to MS is determined by endothelium-dependent, but not endothelium-independent, coronary microvascular function. Moreover, the coronary microvascular responses to MS are reflected in the peripheral microvascular circulation.},

Chest pain/angina frequency in the previous 4 weeks was assessed with the Seattle Angina Questionnaire's angina-frequency subscale. Mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia was assessed with myocardial perfusion imaging during mental stress (standardized public speaking task). Presence of mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia was based on expert readers and established criteria. A conventional (exercise or pharmacologic) stress test was used as a control condition. Results: Overall, 338 individuals (37{\%}) reported angina; 112 (12{\%}) developed mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia, and 256 (29{\%}) developed conventional stress ischemia. Women who reported angina had almost double the probability to develop mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia (19{\%} vs 10{\%}, adjusted prevalence rate ratio, 1.90; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.04-3.46), whereas there was no such difference in men (11{\%} vs 11{\%}, adjusted prevalence rate ratio, 1.09; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.66-1.82). No association was found between angina symptoms and conventional stress ischemia for women or men. Results for ischemia as a continuous variable were similar. Conclusions: In women, but not in men, anginal symptoms may be a marker of vulnerability toward ischemia induced by psychologic stress. These results highlight the psychosocial origins of angina in women and may have important implications for the management and prognosis of women with angina.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Emerging data suggest that young women with coronary heart disease (CHD) are disproportionally vulnerable to the adverse cardiovascular effects of psychological stress. We hypothesized that younger, but not older, women with stable CHD are more likely than their male peers to develop mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI). METHODS AND RESULTS We studied 686 patients (191 women) with stable coronary heart disease (CHD). Patients underwent (99m)Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest and with both mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) stress testing. We compared quantitative (by automated software) and visual parameters of inducible ischemia between women and men and assessed age as an effect modifier. Women had a more-adverse psychosocial profile than men whereas there were few differences in medical history and CHD risk factors. Both quantitative and visual indicators of ischemia with mental stress were disproportionally larger in younger women. For each 10 years of decreasing age, the total reversibility severity score with mental stress was 9.6 incremental points higher (interaction, P{\textless}0.001) and the incidence of MSIMI was 82.6{\%} higher (interaction, P=0.004) in women than in men. Incidence of MSIMI in women ≤50 years was almost 4-fold higher than in men of similar age and older patients. These results persisted when adjusting for sociodemographic and medical risk factors, psychosocial factors, and medications. There were no significant sex differences in inducible ischemia with conventional stress. CONCLUSIONS Young women with stable CHD are susceptible to MSIMI, which could play a role in the prognosis of this group.},

abstract = {Background: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is associated with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, yet the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We measured the inflammatory response to acute laboratory mental stress in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and its association with MSIMI. We hypothesized that patients with MSIMI would have a higher inflammatory response to mental stress in comparison to those without ischemia. Methods: Patients with stable CAD underwent 99mTc sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging during mental stress testing using a public speaking stressor. MSIMI was determined as impaired myocardial perfusion using a 17-segment model. Inflammatory markers including interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) and high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured at rest and 90 min after mental stress. Results were validated in an independent sample of 228 post-myocardial infarction patients. Results: Of 607 patients analyzed in this study, (mean age 63 ± 9 years, 76{\%} male), 99 (16.3{\%}) developed MSIMI. Mental stress resulted in a significant increase in IL-6, MCP-1, and MMP-9 (all p {\textless}0.0001), but not hsCRP. However, the changes in these markers were similar in those with and without MSIMI. Neither resting levels of these biomarkers, nor their changes with mental stress were significantly associated with MSIMI. Results in the replication sample were similar. Conclusion: Mental stress is associated with acute increases in several inflammatory markers. However, neither the baseline inflammatory status nor the magnitude of the inflammatory response to mental stress over 90 min were significantly associated with MSIMI.},
