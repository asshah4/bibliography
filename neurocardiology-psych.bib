abstract = {Research studies focusing on the psychometric properties of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) with psychiatric and nonpsychiatric samples were reviewed for the years 1961 through June, 1986. A meta-analysis of the BDI's internal consistency estimates yielded a mean coefficient alpha of 0.86 for psychiatric patients and 0.81 for nonpsychiatric subjects. The concurrent validitus of the BDI with respect to clinical ratings and the Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) were also high. The mean correlations of the BDI samples with clinical ratings and the HRSD were 0. 72 and 0.73, respectively, for psychiatric patients. With nonpsychiatric subjects, the mean correlations of the BDI with clinical ratings and the HRSD were 0.60 and 0.74, respectively. Recent evidence indicates that the BDI discriminates subtypes of depression and differentiates depression from anxiety. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {Background Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is associated with adverse prognosis in coronary artery disease patients. Anger is thought to be a trigger of acute coronary syndromes and is associated with increased cardiovascular risk; however, little direct evidence exists for a link between anger and myocardial ischemia. Methods [99mTc]-sestamibi single-photon emission tomography was performed at rest, after mental stress (a social stressor with a speech task) and after exercise/pharmacologic stress. Summed scores of perfusion abnormalities were obtained by observer-independent software. A summed-difference score, the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. The Spielberger's State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory was used to assess different anger dimensions. Results The mean age was 50 years, 50{\%} were female, and 60{\%} were non-white. After adjusting for demographic factors, smoking, coronary artery disease severity, depressive, and anxiety symptoms, each IQR increment in state-anger score was associated with 0.36 U-adjusted increase in ischemia as measured by the summed-difference score (95{\%} CI 0.14-0.59); the corresponding association for trait anger was 0.95 (95{\%} CI 0.21-1.69). Anger expression scales were not associated with ischemia. None of the anger dimensions was related to ischemia during exercise/pharmacologic stress. Conclusion Anger, both as an emotional state and as a personality trait, is significantly associated with propensity to develop myocardial ischemia during mental stress but not during exercise/pharmacologic stress. Patients with this psychologic profile may be at increased risk for silent ischemia induced by emotional stress, and this may translate into worse prognosis. (Am Heart J 2015;169:115-121.e2.).},

abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate whether the pathogenesis of type A behavior may involve the premature development of coronary atherosclerosis. Background: Type A or coronary-prone behavior is considered a possible risk factor for the development of coronary heart disease. Premature development of coronary atherosclerosis is suspected to play a role. Utilizing electron beam computed tomography, one can accurately determine the degree of coronary artery calcification, which is reflective of coronary atherosclerosis. Methods: We performed a study of 35 men who had no clinical evidence of coronary heart disease. Twenty exhibited severe type A behavior and 15 exhibited type B behavior. All subjects were given an Electron Beam Computed Tomography scan of their coronary arteries and a treadmill electrocardiogram. Results: Eight of the 20 (40{\%}) type A subjects were found to have coronary calcification compared to none of the type B subjects (P=0.005). The correlation coefficient between type A score and coronary calcium score was 0.39 (P=0.09). Conclusions: The pathophysiology by which type A behavior increases the risk for coronary heart disease may involve the premature development of coronary atherosclerosis. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia is a frequent phenomenon in patients with coronary artery disease. Women with coronary artery disease tend to have more mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia and more chest pain/anginal symptoms than men, but whether the association between mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia and angina burden differs in women and men is unknown. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with experimental manipulation of 950 individuals with stable coronary artery disease. Chest pain/angina frequency in the previous 4 weeks was assessed with the Seattle Angina Questionnaire's angina-frequency subscale. Mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia was assessed with myocardial perfusion imaging during mental stress (standardized public speaking task). Presence of mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia was based on expert readers and established criteria. A conventional (exercise or pharmacologic) stress test was used as a control condition. Results: Overall, 338 individuals (37{\%}) reported angina; 112 (12{\%}) developed mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia, and 256 (29{\%}) developed conventional stress ischemia. Women who reported angina had almost double the probability to develop mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia (19{\%} vs 10{\%}, adjusted prevalence rate ratio, 1.90; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.04-3.46), whereas there was no such difference in men (11{\%} vs 11{\%}, adjusted prevalence rate ratio, 1.09; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.66-1.82). No association was found between angina symptoms and conventional stress ischemia for women or men. Results for ischemia as a continuous variable were similar. Conclusions: In women, but not in men, anginal symptoms may be a marker of vulnerability toward ischemia induced by psychologic stress. These results highlight the psychosocial origins of angina in women and may have important implications for the management and prognosis of women with angina.},

DESIGN Validation study. SETTING A community clinic and an academic center. PARTICIPANTS Ninety-four patients meeting MCI clinical criteria supported by psychometric measures, 93 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score {\textgreater} or =17), and 90 healthy elderly controls (NC). MEASUREMENTS The MoCA and MMSE were administered to all participants, and sensitivity and specificity of both measures were assessed for detection of MCI and mild AD. RESULTS Using a cutoff score 26, the MMSE had a sensitivity of 18{\%} to detect MCI, whereas the MoCA detected 90{\%} of MCI subjects. In the mild AD group, the MMSE had a sensitivity of 78{\%}, whereas the MoCA detected 100{\%}. Specificity was excellent for both MMSE and MoCA (100{\%} and 87{\%}, respectively). CONCLUSION MCI as an entity is evolving and somewhat controversial. The MoCA is a brief cognitive screening tool with high sensitivity and specificity for detecting MCI as currently conceptualized in patients performing in the normal range on the MMSE.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the present paper, we describe a model of neurovisceral integration in which a set of neural structures involved in cognitive, affective, and autonomic regulation are related to heart rate variability (HRV) and cognitive performance. METHODS: We detail the pathways involved in the neural regulation of the cardiovascular system and provide pharmacological and neuroimaging data in support of the neural structures linking the central nervous system to HRV in humans. We review a number of studies from our group showing that individual differences in HRV are related to performance on tasks associated with executive function and prefrontal cortical activity. These studies include comparisons of executive- and nonexecutive-function tasks in healthy participants, in both threatening and nonthreatening conditions. In addition, we show that manipulating resting HRV levels is associated with changes in performance on executive-function tasks. We also examine the relationship between HRV and cognitive performance in ecologically valid situations using a police shooting simulation and a naval navigation simulation. Finally, we review our studies in anxiety patients, as well as studies examining psychopathy. CONCLUSION: These findings in total suggest an important relationship among cognitive performance, HRV, and prefrontal neural function that has important implications for both physical and mental health. Future studies are needed to determine exactly which executive functions are associated with individual differences in HRV in a wider range of situations and populations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is frequent in patients with coronary artery disease and is associated with worse prognosis. Young women with a previous myocardial infarction (MI), a group with unexplained higher mortality than men of comparable age, have shown elevated rates of MSIMI, but the mechanisms are unknown. METHODS We studied 306 patients (150 women and 156 men) ≤61 years of age who were hospitalized for MI in the previous 8 months and 112 community controls (58 women and 54 men) frequency matched for sex and age to the patients with MI. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation and microvascular reactivity (reactive hyperemia index) were measured at rest and 30 minutes after mental stress. The digital vasomotor response to mental stress was assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry. Patients received 99mTc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest, with mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) stress. RESULTS The mean age of the sample was 50 years (range, 22-61). In the MI group but not among controls, women had a more adverse socioeconomic and psychosocial profile than men. There were no sex differences in cardiovascular risk factors, and among patients with MI, clinical severity tended to be lower in women. Women in both groups showed a higher peripheral arterial tonometry ratio during mental stress but a lower reactive hyperemia index after mental stress, indicating enhanced microvascular dysfunction after stress. There were no sex differences in flow-mediated dilation changes with mental stress. The rate of MSIMI was twice as high in women as in men (22{\%} versus 11{\%}, P=0.009), and ischemia with conventional stress was similarly elevated (31{\%} versus 16{\%}, P=0.002). Psychosocial and clinical risk factors did not explain sex differences in inducible ischemia. Although vascular responses to mental stress (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio and reactive hyperemia index) also did not explain sex differences in MSIMI, they were predictive of MSIMI in women only. CONCLUSIONS Young women after MI have a 2-fold likelihood of developing MSIMI compared with men and a similar increase in conventional stress ischemia. Microvascular dysfunction and peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress are implicated in MSIMI among women but not among men, perhaps reflecting women's proclivity toward ischemia because of microcirculatory abnormalities.},

abstract = {Objectives Young women have poorer prognosis after myocardial infarction (MI) and a higher rate of mental stress-induced ischemia compared with similarly aged men. A higher inflammatory status may help explain these sex differences. Methods We examined 98 patients (49 women and 49 men) age 18–59 years with recent MI (past 6 months). Women and men were matched for age, type of MI, and time since MI. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) concentrations were measured at baseline, after mental stress using a speech task, and after exercise/pharmacologic stress (60 and 90 min). Depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and angiographic coronary artery disease (CAD) severity was quantified with the Gensini score. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was used to obtain a computerized measurement of stress-induced ischemia (summed difference score, or SDS) and determine whether severity of stress-induced ischemia affects the inflammatory response to stress. Analysis was stratified by the median age of 50. Geometric mean concentrations of IL-6 were obtained from general linear regression models. Results In both age groups, women had less angiographic CAD and a similar level of conventional risk factors compared with men. Despite this, baseline IL-6 geometric means before both mental and physical stress were twice as high in women ⩽50 years of age compared to age-matched men (3.8 vs. 1.8 pg/mL, p = 0.001, across both conditions), while they were similar in women and men age {\textgreater}50 years (2.3 vs. 2.2 pg/mL, p = 0.83). After mental stress, IL-6 concentrations increased in both women and men in a similar fashion and remained twice as high in women ⩽50 years than men at both 60 min (5.4 vs. 2.6 pg/mL, p = 0.002) and 90 min (5.9 vs. 3.4 pg/mL, p = 0.01). No significant difference was found between women and men?{\textgreater}50 years of age at any time point after mental stress. Results were similar for physical stress. After accounting for SDS, IL-6 concentrations in young women remained higher after both mental and physical stress. Baseline IL-6 concentrations were not significantly related to inducible ischemia. Conclusions After MI, young women aged 50 years or younger, compared with age-matched men, have remarkably higher concentrations of inflammation at baseline and after both mental and physical stress, with a similar inflammatory response to both stressors. Sustained concentrations of inflammation in young women, not their response to stress, may contribute to their adverse outcomes post-MI.},

abstract = {Cognitive impairment is prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but its underlying mechanisms are obscure. Here, we test the hypothesis that exaggerated orthostatic blood pressure reduction mediates the effects of renal failure on global cognition and memory. A total of 160 study subjects were recruited, including 80 dialysis patients and 80 controls. Global cognition was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and episodic memory was evaluated using the auditory verbal learning test (AVLT). Autonomic function was evaluated via the low-frequency to high-frequency ratio (LF/HF) through heart rate variability analysis. Compared with the controls, the dialysis patients had significantly lower MoCA and AVLT scores (including learning memory, short recall memory, and delayed recall memory) (all p {\textless} 0.001). They also showed exaggerated orthostatic systolic blood pressure reductions (all p ≤ 0.001). The maximum orthostatic systolic blood pressure reduction was independently and negatively associated with short ($\beta$ = -0.05, p = 0.029) and delayed ($\beta$ = -0.05, p = 0.035) recall memory in dialysis patients but not in controls. Mediation analysis demonstrated that maximum orthostatic systolic blood pressure reduction mediates 13.8{\%} of the effect of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on short recall memory (p = 0.04). After adjustment for LF/HF, the negative association between maximum orthostatic blood pressure reduction and short recall score remained significant (p = 0.049), while the association between maximum orthostatic blood pressure reduction and delayed recall score became nonsignificant, with a marginal p value of 0.062. Our study reveals that exaggerated orthostatic blood pressure reduction is a possible explanation for ESRD-associated memory deficits.},

abstract = {Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) has been associated with adverse prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but whether this is a uniform finding across different studies has not been described. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies examining the association between MSIMI and adverse outcome events in patients with stable CAD. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases for English language prospective studies of patients with CAD who underwent standardized mental stress testing to determine presence of MSIMI and were followed up for subsequent cardiac events or total mortality. Our outcomes of interest were CAD recurrence, CAD mortality, or total mortality. A summary effect estimate was derived using a fixed-effects meta-analysis model. Only 5 studies, each with a sample size of {\textless}200 patients and fewer than 50 outcome events, met the inclusion criteria. The pooled samples comprised 555 patients with CAD (85{\%} male) and 117 events with a range of follow-up from 35 days to 8.8 years. Pooled analysis showed that MSIMI was associated with a twofold increased risk of a combined end point of cardiac events or total mortality (relative risk 2.24, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.59 to 3.15). No heterogeneity was detected among the studies (Q = 0.39, I2= 0.0{\%}, p = 0.98). In conclusion, although few selected studies have examined the association between MSIMI and adverse events in patients with CAD, all existing investigations point to approximately a doubling of risk. Whether this increased risk is generalizable to the CAD population at large and varies in patient subgroups warrant further investigation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Power spectrum analysis of heart rate variability (PSA of HRV) is a promising method, which can be used as an index of cardiac autonomic balance. PSA of HRV is a noninvasive technique, based on ECG sampling of RR interval variation, thus providing a dynamic assessment of sympathetic and parasympathetic tone, reflecting the interactions between the two. It has been shown to have potential value in various laboratory and clinical conditions. It is influenced by many factors such as age, sex, position, breathing, smoking, hour of the day and medications. Different methods of data processing by various authors have often elicited conflicting results. Standard values are not yet available to be used or compared in different settings. From the interest it has raised, it may be expected that this method will be in widespread use in clinical practice in the future, providing a useful tool, both for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, as well as serving as a further aid towards monitoring therapeutic interventions. This review highlights techniques of dynamic assessment of HRV and studies of its clinical applications in psychiatry in particular. It raises the potentially important prognostic implications of protracted autonomic dysfunction in psychiatric patient populations, especially for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.},

Methods We measured mental fatigability and HF-HRV during a 60-minute cognitive stress protocol in 19 individuals with MCI. HF-HRV responses were modeled using a quadratic equation. Resting state functional connectivity of intra- and inter-network frontobasal ganglia circuitry was assessed using blood-oxygen-level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging among seven of the participants. Results Lower MF was associated with faster and greater rebound in U-shape HF-HRV reactivity, which linked to a stronger connectivity between right middle frontal gyrus and left putamen. Conclusions Results suggest that MF may contribute to abnormal physiological stress regulation in MCI, and fronto basal ganglia circuitry may support the link.},

A population-based sample of 71 men and 79 women (35-64 yrs of age) was studied. Five-minute supine recordings of ECG and beat-to-beat photoplethysmographic finger systolic arterial pressure and diastolic arterial pressure were obtained during paced breathing. Power spectra were computed using a fast Fourier transform for low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) powers. BRS was calculated by cross-spectral analysis of R-R interval and systolic arterial pressure variabilities. PFs were evaluated by 3 self-report questionnaires: the Brief Symptom Inventory, the shortened version of the Spielberger State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory, and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. PFs were not related to HRV. Anxiety was associated with decreased BRS and higher LF power of systolic arterial pressure variability. These associations were independent of age, gender, other psychological factors, heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Hostility was an independent correlate of increased LF power of diastolic arterial pressure and increased HF power of systolic arterial pressure variability.

abstract = {Background: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is associated with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, yet the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We measured the inflammatory response to acute laboratory mental stress in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and its association with MSIMI. We hypothesized that patients with MSIMI would have a higher inflammatory response to mental stress in comparison to those without ischemia. Methods: Patients with stable CAD underwent 99mTc sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging during mental stress testing using a public speaking stressor. MSIMI was determined as impaired myocardial perfusion using a 17-segment model. Inflammatory markers including interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) and high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured at rest and 90 min after mental stress. Results were validated in an independent sample of 228 post-myocardial infarction patients. Results: Of 607 patients analyzed in this study, (mean age 63 ± 9 years, 76{\%} male), 99 (16.3{\%}) developed MSIMI. Mental stress resulted in a significant increase in IL-6, MCP-1, and MMP-9 (all p {\textless}0.0001), but not hsCRP. However, the changes in these markers were similar in those with and without MSIMI. Neither resting levels of these biomarkers, nor their changes with mental stress were significantly associated with MSIMI. Results in the replication sample were similar. Conclusion: Mental stress is associated with acute increases in several inflammatory markers. However, neither the baseline inflammatory status nor the magnitude of the inflammatory response to mental stress over 90 min were significantly associated with MSIMI.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Major depression is a common problem in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and is associated with an increased risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality. It is not known whether treating depression will improve medical prognosis in patients with CHD. Depression is also associated with elevated heart rate and reduced heart rate variability (HRV), which are known risk factors for cardiac morbidity and mortality that may explain the increased risk associated with depression. The purpose of this study was to determine whether treatment for depression with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is associated with decreased heart rate or increased HRV. METHODS Thirty depressed patients with stable CHD, classified as either mildly or moderately to severely depressed, received up to 16 sessions of CBT. The 24-hour heart rate and HRV were measured in these patients and in 22 medically comparable nondepressed controls before and after treatment of the depressed patients. RESULTS Average heart rate and daytime rMSSD (reflecting mostly parasympathetic activity) improved significantly in the severely depressed patients, but remained unchanged in the mildly depressed and the control patients. However, only rMSSD improved to a level comparable to the control patients. None of the remaining indices of HRV showed improvement. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that treating depression with CBT may reduce heart rate and increase short-term HRV. Thus, CBT may have a beneficial effect on a risk factor for mortality in depressed patients with coronary heart disease. A randomized, controlled study is needed to confirm these findings.},

abstract = {Notes that depression in patients with cardiovascular disease is a significant risk factor for developing symptomatic and fatal ischemic heart disease. Moreover, depressed patients have a higher than expected rate of sudden cardiovascular death. Therefore, appropriate treatment of patients with depression and cardiovascular disease cannot be restricted to considerations of either depression or cardiovascular disease in isolation. The tricyclic antidepressants have various effects on the cardiovascular system, including Type IA antiarrhythmic activity that has been associated with an increased risk of mortality in post-myocardial infarction patients. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are not associated with adverse cardiac effects. On the basis of this favorable cardiovascular profile, the SSRIs should therefore be the preferred choice for the treatment of most patients with comorbid depression and cardiovascular disease. Investigation of putative pathophysiologic mechanisms linking depression and cardiovascular mortality, such as the role of platelet activation, will form the basis for further investigation of antidepressant treatments in order to establish if the antidepressants have a beneficial effect on the prognosis of cardiovascular diseases.

abstract = {Vital exhaustion, defined as excessive fatigue, feelings of demoralization, and increased irritability, has been identified as a risk factor for incident and recurrent cardiac events, but there are no population-based prospective studies of this association in US samples. We examined the predictive value of vital exhaustion for incident myocardial infarction or fatal coronary heart disease in middle-aged men and women in 4 US communities. Participants were 12,895 black or white men and women enrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities (ARIC) study cohort and followed for the occurrence of cardiac morbidity and mortality from 1990 through 2002 (maximum follow-up 13.0 years). Vital exhaustion was assessed using the 21-item Maastricht Questionnaire and scores were partitioned into approximate quartiles for statistical analyses. High vital exhaustion (fourth quartile) predicted adverse cardiac events in age-, gender-, and race-center-adjusted analyses (1.69, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.40 to 2.05) and in analyses further adjusted for educational level, body mass index, plasma low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking status, and pack-years of cigarette smoking (1.46, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.20 to 1.79). Risk for adverse cardiac events increased monotonically from the first through the fourth quartile of vital exhaustion. Probabilities of adverse cardiac events over time were significantly higher in people with high vital exhaustion compared to those with low exhaustion (p = 0.002). In conclusion, vital exhaustion predicts long-term risk for adverse cardiac events in men and women, independent of established biomedical risk factors. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The topic of this review has incited perennial debate, because of disagreements over definitions, controversial inferences, and limited availability of relevant measurement tools. The discussion begins appropriately with Cannon's "homeostasis" and his pioneering work in the area. This is followed by mental stress as a scientific idea and the relatively new notions of allostasis and allostatic load. Experimental models of mental stress in rodents and humans are discussed, with particular attention to ethical constraints in humans. Sections follow on sympathoneural responses to mental stress, reactivity of catecholamine systems, clinical pathophysiologic states, and the cardiovascular reactivity hypothesis. Future advancement of the field will require integrative approaches and coordinated efforts between physiologists and psychologists on this interdisciplinary topic.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Low heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of cardiac autonomic dysfunction, has been associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. We examined the association between reduced HRV and incident stroke in a community-based cohort. METHODS The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study measured HRV using 2-minute ECG readings in 12 550 middle-aged adults at baseline (1987-1989). HRV indices were calculated using the SD of RR intervals (SDNN), the mean of all normal RR intervals (meanNN), the root mean square of successive differences of successive RR intervals (RMSSD), low (LF) and high (HF) frequency power, and the LF/HF ratio. All HRV measures were categorized into quintiles. Incident stroke was adjudicated through 2011. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with the lowest HRV quintile as the reference, with and without stratification by prevalent diabetes mellitus. RESULTS Over a median follow-up of 22 years, 816 (6.5{\%}) participants experienced incident stroke. After covariate adjustment, there was no strong evidence of association between HRV and stroke risk. In stratified analyses, the lowest HRV quintile was associated with higher stroke risk compared with the highest quintile for SDNN (HR, 2.0, 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.1-4.0), RMSSD (HR, 1.7; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.9-3.2), LF (HR, 1.5; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.8-3.0), and HF (HR, 1.7; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.9-3.0) only among people with diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS Lower HRV was associated with higher risk of incident stroke among middle-aged adults with prevalent diabetes mellitus but not among people without diabetes mellitus.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine prospectively early-age heart disease (HD) among a national random sample of 4328 male Vietnam veterans, who did not have HD at baseline in 1985. Studies have suggested that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may result in cardiovascular disease. However, many past studies had important methodological limitations to their designs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: Using Cox regressions, we assessed PTSD, age, race, intelligence, family history, obesity, smoking, alcohol abuse, antisocial personality, and depression in predicting HD mortality at follow-up in December 31, 2000. The men were {\textless}65 years old at follow-up.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Using two PTSD measures, a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd Edition (DSM-III) measure (D-PTSD) and one developed by Keane (K-PTSD), we found that among Vietnam theater and era veterans combined (era veterans had no Vietnam service), having PTSD was associated with HD mortality for D-PTSD (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.25, p = .045) and approached significance for K-PTSD (HR = 2.16, p = .066). However, having higher PTSD symptoms on either scale was associated with mortality, with a 5-point increase associated with approximately 20{\%} increase in mortality risk (all p {\textless} .05). Controlling for lifetime depression only slightly altered the results. The effects for theater veterans alone were stronger (D-PTSD: HR = 2.58, p = .025; K-PTSD: HR = 2.73, p = .022). Among theater veterans, controlling for lifetime depression or combat exposure made little difference.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: PTSD was prospectively associated with HD mortality among veterans free of HD at baseline. This study suggests that early-age HD may be an outcome after military service among PTSD-positive veterans.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is a common phenomenon in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and an emerging prognostic factor. Mental stress ischemia is correlated with ambulatory ischemia. However, whether it is related to angina symptoms during daily life has not been examined. METHODS: We assessed angina frequency (past month) in 98 post-myocardial infarction (MI) subjects (age 18-60 years) using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. Patients underwent [(99m)Tc]sestamibi SPECT perfusion imaging at rest, after mental stress, and after exercise/pharmacological stress. Summed scores of perfusion abnormalities were obtained by observer-independent software. A summed difference score (SDS), the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. RESULTS: The mean age was 50 years, 50{\%} were female and 60{\%} were non-white. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, CAD severity, depressive, anger, and anxiety symptoms, each 1-point increase in mental stress-SDS was associated with 1.73-unit increase in the angina frequency score (95{\%} CI: 0.09-3.37) and 17{\%} higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.17, 95{\%} CI: 1.00-1.38). Depressive symptoms were associated with 12{\%} higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.12, 95{\%} CI: 1.03-1.21). In contrast, exercise/pharmacological stress-induced SDS was not associated with angina frequency. CONCLUSION: Among young and middle-aged post-MI patients, myocardial ischemia induced by mental stress in the lab, but not by exercise/pharmacological stress, is associated with higher frequency of retrospectively reported angina during the day. Psychosocial stressors related to mental stress ischemia may be important contributory factor to daily angina.},

Although the therapeutic approach of HRVB is promising in various stress-related disorders, it has only been offered on a regular basis in a few mental health treatment settings. AIM To analyse the efficacy of HRV biofeedback as an additional psychophysiological treatment for depression and PTSD. METHOD Systematic review with search terms HRV, biofeedback, PTSD, depression, panic disorder and anxiety disorder. RESULTS Our search of the literature yielded 789 studies. After critical appraisal using the GRADE method, we selected 6 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 4 relevant studies. The RCTs with control groups 'treatment as usual' and muscle relaxation training revealed significant clinical efficacy and better results than codntrol conditions after 4 to 8 weeks training. CONCLUSION Although this systematic review shows the popularity of HRV in literature, it does not indicate that HRVB really has been reviewed systematically. Significant outcomes of this limited number of randomised studies indicate there may be a clinical improvement when HRVB training is integrated into treatment of PTSD and depression, particularly when this integration procedure is combined with psychotherapy. More research needs to be done with larger groups and further efforts are needed to integrate HRVB into treatment of stress-related disorders in psychiatry. Future research also needs to focus on the psychophysiological mechanisms involved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purposes of this study were to assess the long-term effect of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on blood pressure (BP) trajectories from childhood to young adulthood and to examine whether this relation is explained by childhood socioeconomic status (SES) or risk behaviors that are associated with ACEs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Systolic and diastolic BPs were measured up to 16 times (13 times on average) over a 23-year period in 213 African Americans and 181 European Americans 5 to 38 years of age. Retrospective data on traumatic experiences before 18 years of age were collected, including abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction. Individual growth curve modeling within a multilevel framework was used to examine the relation between exposure to ACEs and BP development. No main effect of ACEs on average BP levels was found. However, a significant interaction of ACE score with age(3) was observed (systolic BP, P=0.033; diastolic BP, P=0.017). Subjects who experienced multiple traumatic events during childhood showed a faster rise in BP levels after 30 years of age than those without ACEs. As expected, a graded association of ACEs with childhood socioeconomic status and negative health behaviors was observed (P{\textless}0.001). The ACE-systolic BP relation was not explained by these factors, whereas the ACE-diastolic BP relation was partially mediated by illicit drug use. CONCLUSION: In this novel longitudinal study, we observed that participants who were exposed to multiple ACEs displayed a greater increase in BP levels in young adulthood compared with their counterparts without ACEs.},

Additional analyses were conducted to examine the relationship of ISEL scores to key demographic variables, as well as the relationship with the Lubben Social Support Scale. We replicated the existing full-scale ISEL subscale structure in this short version. In addition, subscale scores were found to differ across gender, race, level of educational attainment, and marital status, although the magnitude of the various effects was modest. Correlations with another established measure of social support provide convergent validity for this abbreviated instrument. Results suggest this brief measure of perceived social support is a psychometrically valid instrument. An evaluation of its clinical utility is warranted.},

abstract = {There is a bidirectional relationship between affective disorders and cardiovascular abnormalities, often described as a downward spiral, whereas major depressive disorders (MDD, and anxiety disorders) significantly increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVD); CVD are also associated with increased risk of developing MDD (and anxiety disorders). Moreover, the prognosis and progression of CVD is significantly worsened in the presence of MDD. Heart rate variability (HRV) has often been suggested as a potential mediator in this comorbidity. In this review, we discuss HRV alterations in MDD. However, we mainly focus on the direct relationship between HRV alterations and psychiatric symptoms, rather than its relationship with CVD, as this has been reviewed elsewhere. After a general introduction to HRV and how it can be measured, we review how HRV is altered in MDD. We subsequently describe how antidepressant drugs affect HRV, showing that some classes (such as tricyclics) generally worsen HRV, whereas others (most notably selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) have a more positive influence. We also review the effects of several other treatments, with a special focus on vagal nerve stimulation, finishing with some further considerations and recommendation for further research, both in humans and animals., Copyright (C) 2018 YEAR Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Background It has long been hypothesized that PTSD increases the risk of CHD, but empirical evidence using objective measures is limited. Methods We conducted a prospective study of middle-aged male twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Among twin pairs without self-reported CHD at baseline, we selected pairs discordant for a lifetime history of PTSD, pairs discordant for a lifetime history of major depression, and pairs without either condition. All underwent a clinic visit after a median follow-up of 13 years. Outcomes included clinical events (myocardial infarction, other hospitalizations for CHD and coronary revascularization) and quantitative measures of myocardial perfusion by [13N] ammonia positron emission tomography, including a stress total severity score and coronary flow reserve. Results A total of 562 twins (281 pairs) with a mean age of 42.6 years at baseline were included in this study. The incidence of CHD was more than double in twins with PTSD (22.6{\%}) than in those without PTSD (8.9{\%}; p {\textless} 0.001). The association remained robust after adjusting for lifestyle factors, other risk factors for CHD, and major depression (odds ratio: 2.2; 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.2 to 4.1). Stress total severity score was significantly higher (+95{\%}, p = 0.001) and coronary flow reserve was lower (-0.21, p = 0.02) in twins with PTSD than in those without PTSD, denoting worse myocardial perfusion. Associations were only mildly attenuated in 117 twin pairs discordant for PTSD.

For example, women double the rates of stress-related mental disorders such as depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than men, and have higher rates of exposure to adversity early in life. This profile may increase women's long-term risk of cardiometabolic conditions linked to stress, especially coronary heart disease (CHD). In addition to having a higher prevalence of psychosocial stressors, women may be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of these stressors on CHD, perhaps through altered neurobiological physiology. Emerging data suggest that young women are disproportionally susceptible to the adverse effects of stress on the risk of cardiovascular disease, both in terms of initiating the disease as well as worsening the prognosis in women who have already exhibited symptoms of the disease. Women's potential vulnerability to psychosocial stress could also help explain their higher propensity toward abnormal coronary vasomotion and microvascular disease compared with men.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Young women with coronary heart disease have high rates of depression and a higher risk of adverse events than men of similar age. Whether depression has a higher prognostic value in this group than in men and older women is not known. Our objective was to assess whether depression in young women is associated with higher risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and adverse outcomes compared with similarly aged men and older women. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined 3237 patients undergoing coronary angiography for evaluation of CAD and followed them for 2.9 years (median). Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9, and CAD burden was dichotomized based on its presence or absence. After multivariable adjustment for CAD risk factors, depressive symptoms predicted CAD presence in women aged ≤ 55 years (odds ratio=1.07 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.02 to 1.13 per 1 point increase in PHQ-9 score), but not in men aged ≤ 55 years or women aged {\textgreater}55 years. Depressive symptoms also predicted increased risk of death in women aged ≤ 55 years (adjusted hazard ratio=1.07, 95{\%} CI 1.02 to 1.14, per 1 point increase in PHQ-9 score), but not in men aged ≤ 55 years and women aged {\textgreater}55 years, with P=0.02 for the depression-sex interaction and P=0.02 for depression-sex-age interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with suspected or established CAD, depressive symptoms are associated with increased risk of death, particularly in young women. This group may be especially vulnerable to the adverse cardiovascular effects of depression.},

We aimed to quantify the associations of social support, assessed at mid-life, with cognitive function in mid-life and with cognitive decline into late life among African Americans and Caucasians.Methods: data from the community-based, prospective Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort of 15,792 biracial participants were examined for baseline and longitudinal associations of mid-life social support with global cognition at mid-life and with 20-year change in global cognition, respectively, stratified by race. Interactions with sociodemographic and cardiometabolic covariates were additionally explored within each race group. Social support was ascertained using two metrics: interpersonal support and social network.Results: interpersonal support was directly associated with greater global cognition at baseline in both race groups. Social network was directly associated with greater global cognition at baseline among Caucasians and African American females, but it was not significantly associated with global cognition in African American males. Neither mid-life social support measure was associated with 20-year change in global cognition.Conclusions: higher levels of social support were moderately associated with greater multi-dimensional cognitive function at mid-life, but mid-life social support was not associated with temporal change in global cognitive function over 20 years into late life. Prospective studies with time-dependent measures of social support and cognition are needed to better understand the role of social engagement in ageing-related cognitive functioning.},

Patients also underwent conventional stress testing for myocardial ischemia (CSIMI) using exercise or pharmacological stress testing. Furthermore, digital microvascular flow, endothelial function, arterial stiffness, and blood sample collections were performed before, during, and after mental stress. Two-year adverse clinical outcomes are being assessed. RESULTS Six-hundred ninety-five patients completed baseline enrollment in the MIPS. Their mean (standard deviation) age was 62.9 (9.1) years, 72{\%} were men, 30{\%} were African American, and 32{\%} had a history myocardial infarction. The prevalence of MSIMI and CSIMI is 16.1{\%} and 34.7{\%}, respectively. A total of 151 patients (22.9{\%}) had only CSIMI, 28 (4.2{\%}) had only MSIMI, and 78 (11.8{\%}) had both MSIMI and CSIMI. Patients with ischemia had a lower ejection fraction and higher prevalence of previous coronary artery bypass grafting compared with those without inducible ischemia (p {\textless} .050). The prevalence of obstructive CAD was not statistically different between patients with and without MSIMI (p = .426); in contrast, it was higher in patients with CSIMI (p {\textless} .001). CONCLUSIONS The MIPS data will provide useful information to assess the prognostic significance and underlying mechanisms of MSIMI.},

abstract = {Seventy-seven patients undergoing elective cardiac catheterization were administered a diagnostic psychiatric interview and their mean heart rates and heart rate variability were determined from the results of a 24 hr ambulatory ECG. The mean heart rate for depressed patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) was significantly higher than for nondepressed CAD patients, independent of the patient's age, smoking status, and beta blocker therapy. Heart rate variability was lower in depressed patients but did not achieve significance. With the exception of smoking, which was more common in depressed patients, there were no significant differences between the depressed and nondepressed patients on any other medical or demographic variable assessed. It is concluded that elevated heart rate may represent increased sympathetic tone in depressed CAD patients, and may help to explain the increased morbidity and mortality reported in these patients. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Brain imaging studies in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have implicated a circuitry of brain regions including the medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, parietal cortex, and insula. Pharmacological treatment studies have shown a reversal of medial prefrontal deficits in response to traumatic reminders. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a promising non-pharmacologic approach to the treatment of anxiety and pain disorders. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of MBSR on PTSD symptoms and brain response to traumatic reminders measured with positron-emission tomography (PET) in Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) combat veterans with PTSD. We hypothesized that MBSR would show increased prefrontal response to stress and improved PTSD symptoms in veterans with PTSD. METHOD Twenty-six OEF/OIF combat veterans with PTSD who had recently returned from a combat zone were block randomized to receive eight sessions of MBSR or present-centered group therapy (PCGT). PTSD patients underwent assessment of PTSD symptoms with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), mindfulness with the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) and brain imaging using PET in conjunction with exposure to neutral and Iraq combat-related slides and sound before and after treatment. Nine patients in the MBSR group and 8 in the PCGT group completed all study procedures. RESULTS Post-traumatic stress disorder patients treated with MBSR (but not PCGT) had an improvement in PTSD symptoms measured with the CAPS that persisted for 6 months after treatment. MBSR also resulted in an increase in mindfulness measured with the FFMQ. MBSR-treated patients had increased anterior cingulate and inferior parietal lobule and decreased insula and precuneus function in response to traumatic reminders compared to the PCGT group. CONCLUSION This study shows that MBSR is a safe and effective treatment for PTSD. Furthermore, MBSR treatment is associated with changes in brain regions that have been implicated in PTSD and are involved in extinction of fear responses to traumatic memories as well as regulation of the stress response.},

@misc{Vaccarino2013a,
abstract = {Comments on an article by J. H. Turner et al. (see record 2013-30668-001). There is growing recognition that the consequences of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on health may reach far beyond the neuropsychiatric sphere. For many years, studies have documented numerous physical health problems in PTSD, and a possible connection between PTSD and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) has received special attention. The study by Turner et al. confirms these previous findings in a sample of patients from outpatient clinics of two Veteran Affairs Medical Centers. In this study, ischemia was assessed by exercise electrocardiography (ECG). Exercise ECG testing is considered less accurate for the assessment of ischemia than stress testing in conjunction with myocardial perfusion imaging, especially because of low specificity and because ST-segment changes during treadmill ECG testing are weak markers of prevalent or incident ischemic heart disease. Despite these limitations, the results are impressively similar to the twin study mentioned earlier, showing about twice the prevalence of ischemia in patients with PTSD compared with those without the disease. Non-ECG measures of exercise treadmill testing-in particular, exercise capacity-have emerged as stronger predictors of cardiovascular risk than ECG measures. It is unfortunate that exercise capacity data from the treadmill tests were not presented in this article because they would have been useful complementary information. The study by Turner et al. provides welcome new evidence of a link between PTSD and CHD. The mechanisms behind this relationship, however, still need to be understood. Clearly, maladaptive behaviors, such as smoking and substance abuse, which are almost invariably more common in persons with PTSD, may be implicated. Lower propensity to seek medical care and poor functioning could translate to reduced self-care or reduced access to health care. In addition to behavioral and lifestyle factors, however, it has long been suggested that neurobiological features characteristic of PTSD could have potential damaging effects on the cardiovascular system.

abstract = {Background: Acute coronary syndromes (ACS; myocardial infarction or unstable angina) can induce posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and ACS-induced PTSD may increase patients' risk for subsequent cardiac events and mortality. Objective: To determine the prevalence of PTSD induced by ACS and to quantify the association between ACS-induced PTSD and adverse clinical outcomes using systematic review and meta-analysis. Data Sources: Articles were identified by searching Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Scopus, and through manual search of reference lists. Methodology/Principal Findings: Observational cohort studies that assessed PTSD with specific reference to an ACS event at least 1 month prior. We extracted estimates of the prevalence of ACS-induced PTSD and associations with clinical outcomes, as well as study characteristics. We identified 56 potentially relevant articles, 24 of which met our criteria (N = 2383). Meta-analysis yielded an aggregated prevalence estimate of 12{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 9{\%}–16{\%}) for clinically significant symptoms of ACS-induced PTSD in a random effects model. Individual study prevalence estimates varied widely (0{\%}–32{\%}), with significant heterogeneity in estimates explained by the use of a screening instrument (prevalence estimate was 16{\%} [95{\%} CI, 13{\%}–20{\%}] in 16 studies) vs a clinical diagnostic interview (prevalence estimate was 4{\%} [95{\%} CI, 3{\%}–5{\%}] in 8 studies). The aggregated point estimate for the magnitude of the relationship between ACS-induced PTSD and clinical outcomes (ie, mortality and/or ACS recurrence) across the 3 studies that met our criteria (N = 609) suggested a doubling of risk (risk ratio, 2.00; 95{\%} CI, 1.69–2.37) in ACS patients with clinically significant PTSD symptoms relative to patients without PTSD symptoms. Conclusions/Significance: This meta-analysis suggests that clinically significant PTSD symptoms induced by ACS are moderately prevalent and are associated with increased risk for recurrent cardiac events and mortality. Further tests of the association of ACS-induced PTSD and clinical outcomes are needed.},

abstract = {Study objectives: Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery is a common and successful procedure for revascularisation. However, the experience can induce emotional reactions prior to and following surgery. This study aimed to document changes in blood pressure (BP) reactivity and heart rate variability (HRV) following CABG surgery, and to determine the impact of mood state, particularly anxiety and depression upon cardiovascular functioning. Method: Twenty-two patients preparing to receive elective, first time CABG surgery were recruited from The Cardiothoracic Centre, Liverpool, UK and psychologically assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD), Global Mood Scale (GMS) and the Dispositional Resilience Scale (DRI). BP and heart rate responses were also measured during four conditions: baseline response; laboratory session; ambulatory monitoring; and self-initialised recordings during the ambulatory period. In addition, HRV was measured for 12 h in conjunction with the ambulatory monitoring period. All measures were assessed 1 week prior to surgery and 2 months following surgery. Results: A significant decrease in negative mood and an increase in positive mood were reported following surgery. Forty percent of patients were clinically anxious and depressed prior to surgery although this was reduced to 27{\%} after surgery. Depression was the strongest independent predictor of pre-operative BP and HRV whilst anxiety was most significantly related to follow-up BP reactivity. DBP was most strongly predicted by mood state. Conclusions: These results suggest that patients with higher levels of anxiety and depression are at risk of reduced HRV and increased BP reactivity in response to mental stressors. The study also strongly suggests that current patient services should be expanded to acknowledge the role of psychological factors within clinical prognosis after CABG surgery. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Objective To investigate the effect on long-term major adverse cardiac events (MACE) of escitalopram treatment of depression in patients with recent ACS. Design, Setting, and Participants Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted among 300 patients with recent ACS and depression enrolled from May 2007 to March 2013, with follow-up completed in June 2017, at Chonnam National University Hospital, Gwangju, South Korea. Interventions Patients were randomly assigned to receive either escitalopram in flexible dosages of 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg/d (n = 149) or matched placebo (n = 151) for 24 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was MACE, a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Four secondary outcomes were the individual MACE components of all-cause mortality, cardiac death, MI, and PCI. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the escitalopram and placebo groups by time to first MACE. Results Among 300 randomized patients (mean age, 60 years; 119 women [39.3{\%}]), 100{\%} completed a median of 8.1 (interquartile range, 7.5-9.0) years of follow-up. MACE occurred in 61 patients (40.9{\%}) receiving escitalopram and in 81 (53.6{\%}) receiving placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95{\%} CI, 0.49-0.96;P = .03). Comparing individual MACE outcomes between the escitalopram and placebo groups, respectively, incidences for all-cause mortality were 20.8{\%} vs 24.5{\%} (HR, 0.82; 95{\%} CI, 0.51-1.33;P = .43), for cardiac death, 10.7{\%} vs 13.2{\%} (HR, 0.79; 95{\%} CI, 0.41-1.52;P = .48); for MI, 8.7{\%} vs 15.2{\%} (HR, 0.54; 95{\%} CI, 0.27-0.96;P = .04), and for PCI, 12.8{\%} vs 19.9{\%} (HR, 0.58; 95{\%} CI, 0.33-1.04;P = .07). Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with depression following recent acute coronary syndrome, 24-week treatment with escitalopram compared with placebo resulted in a lower risk of major adverse cardiac events after a median of 8.1 years. Further research is needed to assess the generalizability of these findings. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT00419471},

abstract = {AIMS: Prospective studies have shown that social isolation (i.e. lack of social contacts) predicts incident coronary heart disease (CHD), but it is unclear whether it predicts incident heart failure (HF) and what factors might mediate this association. HF patients may be more susceptible to social isolation as they tend to be older and may have disrupted social relationships due to life course factors (e.g. retirement or bereavement). We prospectively examined whether individuals with higher vs. low social isolation have a higher incidence of HF and determined whether this association is mediated by vital exhaustion.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We estimated incident HF hospitalization or death among 14 348 participants from Visit 2 (1990-1992) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study using Cox proportional hazard models which were sequentially adjusted for age, race/study community, gender, current smoking, alcohol use, and co-morbidities. We conducted mediation analyses according to the Baron and Kenny method. After a median follow-up of 16.9 person-years, 1727 (13.0{\%}) incident HF events occurred. The adjusted hazard of incident HF was greater for those in the higher vs. low social isolation risk group (hazard ratio 1.21, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.08-1.35). Our data suggest that vital exhaustion strongly mediates the association between higher social isolation and incident HF (the percentage change in beta coefficient for higher vs. low social isolation groups after adjusting for vital exhaustion was 36{\%}).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: These data suggest that greater social isolation is an independent risk factor for incident HF, and this association appears to be strongly mediated by vital exhaustion.},

abstract = {Repeated single exposures to social stressors induce robust shifts of cardiac sympathovagal balance toward sympathetic dominance both during and after each agonistic interaction. However, little evidence is available regarding possible persistent pathophysiological changes due to chronic social challenge. In this study, male CD-1 mice (n = 14) were implanted with a radiotelemetry system for electrocardiographic recordings. We assessed the effects of chronic psychosocial stress (15-day sensory contact with a dominant animal and daily 5-min defeat episodes) on 1) sympathovagal responsiveness to each defeat episode, as measured via time-domain indexes of heart rate variability (R-R interval, standard deviation of R-R interval, and root mean square ofsto successive R-R interval differences), 2) circadian rhythmicity of heart rate across the chronic challenge (night phase, day phase, and rhythm amplitude values), and 3) amount of myocardial structural damage (volume fraction, density, and extension of fibrosis). This study indicated that there was habituation of acute cardiac autonomic responsiveness, i.e., the shift of sympathovagal balance toward sympathetic dominance was significantly reduced across repeated defeat episodes. Moreover, animals exhibited significant changes in heart rate rhythmicity, i.e., increments in day and night values and reductions in the rhythm amplitude, but these were limited to the first 5 days of chronic psychosocial stress. The volume fraction of fibrosis was sixfold larger than in control animals, because of the appearance of many microscopic scarrings. In summary, although mice appeared to adapt to chronic psychosocial stress in terms of acute cardiovascular responsiveness and heart rate rhythmicity, structural alterations occurred at the myocardial level.},

Reduced HRV, a measure of autonomic dysfunction, has been linked to depression but many studies have inadequately controlled for familial and environmental factors. Furthermore, little is known about whether depression and HRV share common genetic pathways.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We performed power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms in 288 middle-aged male twins. Log-normalized ultra low, very low, low, high frequency, and total power were calculated. A lifetime history of major depressive disorder (MDD) was determined, using the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders, and current depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory. Mixed-effect regression models were used to account for intrapair variability and estimate within-pair effects at the same time controlling for potential confounders.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Both current depressive symptoms and a history of MDD were significantly associated with lower HRV. There was a graded effect, and power in each frequency band was 29{\%} to 36{\%} lower in the lowest band compared with the highest BDI category. All HRV measures except high frequency remained significantly associated with current depressive symptoms in multivariable analysis, but not with lifetime history of MDD. When analyses were stratified by zygosity, a significant within-pair association between BDI score and HRV was found in the dizygotic but not in the monozygotic twins, suggesting a genetic influence on the association.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: A shared, genetically influenced biological pathway underlies the association between depression and lower HRV.

abstract = {UNLABELLED In patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), mental stress may provoke ischemic electrocardiograph changes and abnormalities in regional and global left ventricular function. However, little is known about the underlying myocardial blood flow response (MBF) in these patients. METHODS We investigated the hemodynamic, neurohumoral, and myocardial blood flow responses to mental stress in 17 patients with CAD and 17 healthy volunteers of similar age. Mental stress was induced by asking individuals to solve mathematic subtractions in a progressively challenging sequence; MBF was quantified at rest and during mental stress using 13N ammonia PET. RESULTS Mental stress induced significant (P {\textless} 0.01) and comparable increases in rate-pressure product, measured in beats per minute x mm Hg, in both patients (from 7826 +/- 2006 to 10586 +/- 2800) and healthy volunteers (from 8227 +/- 1272 to 10618 +/- 2468). Comparable increases also occurred in serum epinephrine (58{\%} in patients versus 52{\%} in healthy volunteers) and norepinephrine (22{\%} in patients versus 27{\%} in healthy volunteers). Although MBF increased in patients (from 0.67 +/- 0.15 to 0.77 +/- 0.18 mL/min/g, P {\textless} 0.05) and healthy volunteers (from 0.73 +/- 0.13 to 0.95 +/- 0.22 mL/min/g, P {\textless} 0.001), the magnitude of flow increase was smaller in patients (14{\%} +/- 17{\%}) than in healthy volunteers (29{\%} +/- 14{\%}) (P = 0.01). The increase in MBF during mental stress correlated significantly with changes in cardiac work in healthy volunteers (r = 0.77; P {\textless} 0.001) but not in patients. CONCLUSION Despite similar increases in cardiac work and comparable sympathetic stimulation in CAD patients and healthy volunteers, CAD patients exhibit an attenuated blood flow response to mental stress that may contribute to mental stress-induced ischemic episodes in daily life.},

abstract = {Mental stress-induced ischemia approximately doubles the risk of cardiac events in patients with coronary artery disease, yet the mechanisms underlying changes in coronary blood flow in response to mental stress are poorly characterized. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) regulates basal coronary blood flow in healthy humans and mediates mental stress-induced vasodilation in the forearm. However, its possible role in mental stress-induced increases in coronary blood flow is unknown. We studied 11 patients (6 men and 5 women, mean age: 58 ± 14 yr) undergoing elective diagnostic cardiac catheterization and assessed the vasodilator response to mental stress elicited by the Stroop color-word test. Intracoronary substance P (20 pmol/min) and isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg) were used to assess endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation, respectively. Coronary blood flow was estimated using intracoronary Doppler recordings and quantitative coronary angiography to measure coronary artery diameter. Mental stress increased coronary flow by 34 ± 7.0{\%} over the preceding baseline during saline infusion (P {\textless} 0.01), and this was reduced to 26 ± 7.0{\%} in the presence of the selective nNOS inhibitor S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline (0.625 µmol/min, P {\textless} 0.001). Mental stress increased coronary artery diameter by 6.9 ± 3.7{\%} (P = 0.02) and 0.5 ± 2.8{\%} (P = 0.51) in the presence of S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline. The response to substance P did not predict the response to mental stress (r(2) = -0.22, P = 0.83). nNOS mediates the human coronary vasodilator response to mental stress, predominantly through actions at the level of coronary resistance vessels.NEW {\&} NOTEWORTHY Acute mental stress induces vasodilation of the coronary microvasculature. Here, we show that this response involves neuronal nitric oxide synthase in the human coronary circulation.Listen to this article's corresponding podcast at http://ajpheart.podbean.com/e/nnos-and-coronary-flow-during-mental-stress/.},

Haller, Maria Korre, Konstantina Sampani, Luiz Guilherme Grossi Porto, Patricia C. Fehling, Costas A. Christophi, Stefanos N. Kales Abstract Sudden cardiac death accounted for 42{\%} of all firefighter duty-related fatalities over the last decade. This retrospective study analyzed available medical examiner records for duty-related firefighter fatalities among male firefighters 18–65 years of age that occurred between 1999 and 2014 and reported the pathoanatomic substrate for cardiac-related fatalities. Odds of duty-related cardiac death during specific duties compared with fire station duties were calculated by pathoanatomic substrate. There were 285 cardiac fatalities. Eighty percent of fatalities had evidence at autopsy of coronary heart disease (CHD) and increased heart size (cardiomegaly/left ventricular hypertrophy). CHD alone, cardiomegaly or left ventricular hypertrophy, and causes other than CHD or increased heart size were identified in 7.7{\%}, 6.0{\%}, and 6.7{\%} of fatalities, respectively. The largest proportion of deaths occurred during fire suppression (33{\%}), although only 1{\%} of annual occupational time was estimated to be spent performing this duty. For deaths attributed to CHD and increased heart size, fire suppression, alarm response, and physical training were associated with approximately a 112-fold, 8-fold, and 7-fold increased risk of cardiac death, respectively, compared with station duties. In conclusion, the majority of firefighters who suffered a duty-related cardiac death had CHD and increased heart size, which was associated with a markedly increased risk of death during fire suppression compared with station duties. Targeted occupational medical screening for CHD and increased heart size may reduce duty-related cardiac deaths among firefighters.},

abstract = {Background The Secondary Prevention in Uppsala Primary Healthcare Project (SUPRIM) was a randomized controlled trial of a group-based cognitive behavioural therapy stress management programme for patients with coronary heart disease. The project was successful in reducing the risk of fatal or non-fatal first recurrent cardiovascular events. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy on self-rated stress, somatic anxiety, vital exhaustion and depression and to study the associations of these factors with the reduction in cardiovascular events. Methods A total of 362 patients were randomly assigned to intervention or usual care groups. The psychological outcomes were assessed five times during 24 months and analysed using linear mixed models. The mediating roles of the outcomes were analysed using joint modelling of the longitudinal and time to event data. Results The intervention had a positive effect on somatic anxiety ( p {\textless} 0.05), reflecting a beneficial development over time compared with the controls. Stress, vital exhaustion and depression did not differ between the groups over time. Mediator analysis suggested that somatic anxiety may have mediated the effect of treatment on cardiovascular events. Conclusions The intervention had a small positive effect on somatic anxiety, but did not affect stress, vital exhaustion or depression in patients with coronary heart disease. Somatic anxiety was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and might act as a partial mediator in the treatment effect on cardiovascular events. However, the mechanisms between the intervention and the protective cardiovascular outcome remain to be identified.},

abstract = {The objectives of this review are to discuss the diversity of mechanisms that may explain the association between heart rate (HR) variability and mortality, to appraise the clinical applicability of traditional and new measures of HR variability and to propose future directions in this field of research. There is a large body of data demonstrating that abnormal HR variability measured over a 24-h period provides information on the risk of subsequent death in subjects with and without structural heart disease. However, the mechanisms responsible for this association are not completely established. Therefore, no specific therapy is currently available to improve the prognosis for patients with abnormal HR variability. Reduced HR variability has been most commonly associated with a risk of arrhythmic death, but recent data suggest that abnormal variability also predicts vascular causes of death, progression of coronary atherosclerosis and death due to heart failure. A consensus is also lacking on the best HR variability measure for clinical purposes. Time and frequency domain measures of HR variability have been most commonly used, but recent studies show that new analysis methods based on nonlinear dynamics may be more powerful in terms of risk stratification. Before the measurement of HR variability can be applied to clinical practice and used to direct therapy, more precise insight into the pathophysiological link between HR variability and mortality are needed. Further studies should also address the issue of which of the HR variability indexes, including the new nonlinear measures, is best for clinical purposes in various patient populations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction is a putative underlying mechanism for increased cardiovascular disease risk in individuals with psychiatric disorders. Previous studies suggest that this risk may be related to psychotropic medication use. In the present study we systematically reviewed and analyzed published studies of heart rate variability (HRV), measuring ANS output, to determine the effect of psychiatric illness and medication use. METHODS We searched for studies comparing HRV in physically healthy adults with a diagnosed psychiatric disorder to controls and comparing HRV pre- and post-treatment with a psychotropic medication. RESULTS In total, 140 case-control (mood, anxiety, psychosis, dependent disorders, k = 151) and 30 treatment (antidepressants, antipsychotics; k = 43) studies were included. We found that HRV was reduced in all patient groups compared to controls (Hedges g = -0.583) with a large effect for psychotic disorders (Hedges g = -0.948). Effect sizes remained highly significant for medication-free patients compared to controls across all disorders. Smaller and significant reductions in HRV were observed for specific antidepressants and antipsychotics. LIMITATIONS Study quality significantly moderated effect sizes in case-control analyses, underscoring the importance of assessing methodological quality when interpreting HRV findings. CONCLUSION Combined findings confirm substantial reductions in HRV across psychiatric disorders, and these effects remained significant even in medication-free individuals. Reductions in HRV may therefore represent a significant mechanism contributing to elevated cardiovascular risk in individuals with psychiatric disorders. The negative impact of specific medications on HRV suggest increased risk for cardiovascular disease in these groups, highlighting a need for treatment providers to consider modifiable cardiovascular risk factors to attenuate this risk.},

In patients with coronary artery disease, mental stress can induce myocardial ischemia. However, even the determinants of the physiological myocardial blood flow (MBF) response to mental stress are poorly understood. Twenty-four individuals (12 males/12 females, mean age 49 +/- 13 yr, range 31-74 yr) with a low likelihood for coronary artery disease were studied. Serum catecholamines, cardiac work, and MBF (measured quantitatively with N-13 ammonia and positron emission tomography) were assessed. During mental stress (arithmetic calculation) MBF increased significantly from 0.70 +/- 0.14 to 0.92 +/- 0.21 ml x min(-1) x g(-1) (P {\textless} 0.01). Mental stress caused significant increases (P {\textless} 0.01) in serum epinephrine (26 +/- 16 vs. 42 +/- 17 pg/ml), norepinephrine (272 +/- 139 vs. 322 +/- 136 pg/ml), and cardiac work [rate-pressure product (RPP) 8,011 +/- 1,884 vs. 10,416 +/- 2,711]. Stress-induced changes in cardiac work were correlated with changes in MBF (r = 0.72; P {\textless} 0.01). Multiple-regression analysis revealed stress-induced changes in the RPP as the only significant (P = 0.0001) predictor for the magnitude of mental stress-induced increases in MBF in healthy individuals. Data from this group of healthy individuals should prove useful to investigate coronary vasomotion in individuals at risk for or with documented coronary artery disease.},

Six hundred thirty-seven veterans without known CAD (61 ± 9 years of age, 12.2{\%} women) underwent CAC scanning for clinical indications and their psychological health status (PTSD vs non-PTSD) was evaluated. In subjects with PTSD, CAC was more prevalent than in the non-PTSD cohort (76.1{\%} vs 59{\%}, p = 0.001) and their CAC scores were significantly higher in each Framingham risk score category compared to the non-PTSD group. Multivariable generalized linear regression analysis identified PTSD as an independent predictor of presence and extent of atherosclerotic CAD (p {\textless}0.01). During a mean follow-up of 42 months, the death rate was higher in the PTSD compared to the non-PTSD group (15, 17.1{\%}, vs 57, 10.4{\%}, p = 0.003). Multivariable survival regression analyses revealed a significant linkage between PTSD and mortality and between CAC and mortality. After adjustment for risk factors, relative risk (RR) of death was 1.48 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.03 to 2.91, p = 0.01) in subjects with PTSD and CAC score {\textgreater}0 compared to subjects without PTSD and CAC score equal to 0. With a CAC score equal to 0, risk of death was not different between subjects with and without PTSD (RR 1.04, 95{\%} CI 0.67 to 6.82, p = 0.4). Risk of death in each CAC category was higher in subjects with PTSD compared to matched subjects without PTSD (RRs 1.23 for CAC scores 1 to 100, 1.51 for CAC scores 101 to 400, and 1.81 for CAC scores {\textless}400, p {\textless}0.05 for all comparisons). In conclusion, PTSD is associated with presence and severity of coronary atherosclerosis and predicts mortality independent of age, gender, and conventional risk factors. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Objective: To (1) report the prognostic association between anxiety disorder subtypes and major adverse cardiac events (MACE), (2) report anxiety disorder prevalence in coronary heart disease (CHD), and (3) report the efficacy of anxiety disorder treatments in CHD. Methods: A comprehensive electronic database search was performed in November 2013 for studies reporting anxiety disorder prevalence according to structured interview in CHD samples or MACE, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing anxiety disorder treatment with placebo or usual care. From 4041 articles 42 samples were selected for extraction (8 for MACE prognosis, 39 for prevalence, no RCTs were eligible). Results: Five generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) studies reported 883 MACE events (combined n = 2851). There was a non-significant association between GAD and MACE (risk ratio = 1.20, 95{\%} CI .86-1.68, P= .28) however the effect size was highly significant in outpatient samples (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.94, 95{\%} CI 1.45-2.60, P{\textless} .001). No other anxiety disorder subtype was associated with MACE. Prevalence data showed high comorbidity with depression (49.06{\%}; 95{\%} CI 34.28-64.01) and substantial heterogeneity between studies. Panic disorder prevalence was higher in psychiatrist/psychologist raters (9.92{\%} vs. 4.74{\%}) as was GAD (18.45{\%} vs. 13.01{\%}). Panic and GAD estimates were also heterogeneous according to DSM-III-R versus DSM-IV taxonomies. Conclusions: The paucity of extant anxiety disorder RCTs, alongside MACE risk for GAD outpatients, should stimulate further anxiety disorder intervention in CHD populations. Research should focus on depression and anxiety, thereby unraveling disorder specific and more generic pathways.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression is associated with increased risk of death among patients with coronary disease. Cardiovascular autonomic dysregulation may be one of the mechanisms by which depression exerts its effects on cardiovascular function. The purpose of this study was to determine whether depressive symptoms are associated with low heart rate variability (HRV) and prolonged HR recovery after exercise testing in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: The Psychophysiological Investigation of Myocardial Ischemia (PIMI) was a large, multicenter study designed to assess psychological and physiological correlates of stress in patients with CAD. One hundred and eighty-eight patients with CAD as evidenced by at least 50{\%} blockage of one major artery and a previous positive exercise stress test were included in this study. Patients included in this report were not taking beta blockers. Cardiovascular functioning was assessed by a modified Bruce protocol treadmill stress test. Measures of psychological functioning, including the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), were also obtained. RESULTS: BDI scores were negatively correlated with HR recovery (r = -0.15, p = .04). Depression scores accounted for 3.5{\%} of the variance in HR recovery when controlling for participant age (p {\textless} .01). Depressive symptoms were related to two HRV indices (ultra-low frequency, high frequency). CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms are associated with cardiovascular autonomic nervous system dysfunction as assessed by HR recovery. This relationship is not merely due to an association of depression severity with beta blocker usage or a failure of depressed patients to achieve an adequate chronotropic response.},

Notably, one aspect of PTSD, particularly in veterans, is its comorbidity with suicide. Elevated aggressiveness predicts high-risk to suicide in humans and despite the difficulty in reproducing a complex human suicidal behavior in rodents, aggressive behavior is a well reproducible behavioral trait of suicide. PTSD animal models are based on a peculiar phenotype, including exaggerated fear memory, anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors associated with neurochemical dysregulations in emotional brain circuitry. The endocannabinoid and the neurosteroid systems regulate emotions and stress responses, and recent evidence shows these two systems are interrelated and critically compromised in neuropsychiatric disorders. For instance, levels of the neurosteroid, allopregnanolone, as well as those of the endocannabinoids, anandamide and its congener, palmitoylethanolamide are decreased in PTSD. Similarly, the endocannabinoid system and neurosteroid biosynthesis are altered in suicidal individuals. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the only FDA-approved treatments for PTSD and depression, fail to help half of the treatment-seeking patients. This highlights the need for developing biomarker-based efficient therapies. One promising hypothesis points to stimulation of allopregnanolone biosynthesis as a valid end-point to predict treatment response in PTSD patients. This review highlights running findings on the role of the endocannabinoid and neurosteroid systems in PTSD and suicidal behavior both in a preclinical and clinical perspective. A specific focus is given to predictive PTSD/suicide animal models. Ultimately, we discuss the idea that disruption of neurosteroid and endocannabinoid biosynthesis may offer novel promising biomarker candidates to develop new treatments for PTSD and, perhaps, suicidal behavior.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Depression is known to be associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This population-based cohort study aimed to determine the association between depression of varying severity and risk for CVD and to study the effect of concomitant anxious distress on this association. METHODS We utilized data from a longitudinal cohort study of mental health, work and relations among adults (20-64 years), with a total of 10,443 individuals. Depression and anxious distress were assessed using psychiatric rating scales and defined according to DSM-5. Outcomes were register-based and self-reported cardiovascular diseases. FINDINGS Overall increased odds ratios of 1.5 to 2.6 were seen for the different severity levels of depression, with the highest adjusted OR for moderate depression (OR 2.1 (95{\%} CI 1.3, 3.5). Similar odds ratios were seen for sub-groups of CVD: ischemic/hypertensive heart disease and stroke, 2.4 (95{\%} CI 1.4, 3.9) and OR 2.1 (95{\%}CI 1.2, 3.8) respectively. Depression with anxious distress as a specifier of severity showed OR of 2.1 (95{\%} CI 1.5, 2.9) for CVD. CONCLUSION This study found that severity level of depression seems to be of significance for increased risk of CVD among depressed persons, although not in a dose-response manner which might be obscured due to treatment of depression. Further, we found a higher risk of CVD among depressed individuals with symptoms of anxious distress.},

Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA, quantified by high-frequency HR variability) were assessed as measures of sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiovascular activity, respectively. A mediation model was calculated to test the indirect effects of ACEs on HR via SBP and RSA. RESULTS The effect of ACEs on HR reactivity was mediated by SBP reactivity but not by RSA reactivity. ACEs were associated with reduced SBP at rest. CONCLUSIONS ACEs were associated with down-regulation in a measure of sympathetic but no alteration in a measure of parasympathetic cardiovascular stress reactivity in adulthood.

abstract = {A broad spectrum of research, spanning epidemiological studies, clinical research, preclinical investigations and animal models, has pointed to a link between psychological factors and cardiovascular dysfunctional states. Acute and chronic life stressors, psychological alterations such as anxiety and depression, personality traits such as anger and hostility, reactive behavioral coping strategies, as well as the absence of social support have all been shown to interfere with and modulate the onset and progression of cardiovascular alterations. These psychological elements, in many instances, appear to be independent risk factors of disease, as important as traditional ones such as cholesterol levels, waist fat, body mass index and poor physical activity. Recently developed research approaches have shed light on the brain substrates, genetic and epigenetic factors, as well as cellular/molecular mechanisms that underlie the tight and complex relationship between stress, behavior and the cardiovascular system. However, despite a growing number of empirical investigations and accumulating clinical evidence, still several issues remain to be clarified about the mechanisms linking stressful events, psychological traits, behavioral coping and cardiovascular risk profiles. This special issue is a collection of 19 selected review papers that present the newest scientific evidence in the multidisciplinary arena intersecting stress, behavior and the cardiovascular system. It gathers the contribution of leading scientists from a variety of disciplines (neuroscience, physiology, cardiology, pharmacology, psychology, epidemiology) who share a common interest in the complex interactions between the mind and the heart. A deeper understanding of such complex relationship cannot be achieved without a multipronged effort that includes basic science, preclinical research on animal models and human clinical and nonclinical studies.

Autonomic changes are often found in altered mood states and appear to be a central biological substrate linking depression to a number of physical dysfunctions. Alterations of autonomic nervous system functioning that promotes vagal withdrawal are reflected in reductions of heart rate variability (HRV) indexes. Reduced HRV characterizes emotional dysregulation, decreased psychological flexibility and defective social engagement, which in turn are linked to prefrontal cortex hypoactivity. Altogether, these pieces of evidence support the idea that HRV might represent a useful endophenotype for psychological/physical comorbidities, and its routine application should be advised to assess the efficacy of prevention/intervention therapies in a number of psychosomatic and psychiatric dysfunctions. Further research, also making use of appropriate animal models, could provide a significant support to this point of view and possibly help to identify appropriate antidepressant therapies that do not interefere with physical health.},

abstract = {Serotonin (5-HT) is crucial to normal reflex vagal modulation of heart rate (HR). Reduced baroreflex sensitivity [spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (sBRS)] and HR variability (HRV) reflect impaired neural, particularly vagal, control of HR and are independently associated with depression. In conscious, telemetered Flinders-Sensitive Line (FSL) rats, a well-validated animal model of depression, we tested the hypothesis that cardiovascular regulatory abnormalities are present and associated with deficient serotonergic control of reflex cardiovagal function. In FSL rats and control Flinders-Resistant (FRL) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat strains, diurnal measurements of HR, arterial pressure (AP), activity, sBRS, and HRV were made. All strains had normal and similar diurnal variations in HR, AP, and activity. In FRL rats, HR was elevated, contributing to the reduced HRV and sBRS in this strain. In FSL rats, sBRS and high-frequency power HRV were reduced during the night, indicating reduced reflex cardiovagal activity. The ratio of low- to high-frequency bands of HRV was increased in FSL rats, suggesting a relative predominance of cardiac sympathetic and/or reflex activity compared with FRL and SD rats. These data show that conscious FSL rats have cardiovascular regulatory abnormalities similar to depressed humans. Acute changes in HR, AP, temperature, and sBRS in response to 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, a 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1B), and 5-HT(7) receptor agonist, were also determined. In FSL rats, despite inducing an exaggerated hypothermic effect, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin did not decrease HR and AP or improve sBRS, suggesting impaired serotonergic neural control of cardiovagal activity. These data suggest that impaired serotonergic control of cardiac reflex function could be one mechanism linking reduced sBRS to increased cardiac risk in depression.},

Although definitions vary, most include both tangible components (e.g., financial assistance and physical aid) and intangible components (e.g., encouragement and guidance). Social support has been implicated in the mediation of stressful life events, recovery from illness, and increased program adherence. There are many inconsistent findings in the literature, however, and it is difficult to resolve discrepancies because measures of social support vary widely from study to study. To guide in the selection of measurement methods for research and applied work, 23 techniques for assessing social support are reviewed and evaluated. Criteria for favorable evaluation included reliability coefficients greater than .8 and documentation of validity. Correlations between various social support and criterion measures are simulated in order to demonstrate the consequences of choosing a measure with low reliability. Scale developers reported reliability data for 19 of the reviewed measures. Internal consistency coefficients ranged from .31 to .98. Test-retest coefficients ranged from .22 to .96. At least some validity documentation was available for 13 of the scales. Discriminant validity evidence, however, is almost universally absent.

We investigated the association of SVI with cognitive impairment in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS Patients with a new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (n=43) and age-matched healthy control subjects (n=43) were recruited for the study. Body mass index and blood pressure measurements were recorded. SVI was assessed by spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV), and cognitive function was assessed by recording the positive wave that appears in 300 milliseconds from application of stimulus in event-related potential tracing (P300). Insulin resistance was determined by the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) formula using blood glucose and insulin data, and oxidative stress was assessed by estimation of malondialdehyde. Association of various factors with cognitive impairment was evaluated by Pearson correlation analysis, and independent contributions of these factors to cognitive impairment were assessed by multiple regression analysis. RESULTS P300 latency was significantly prolonged in the diabetes group compared with the control group. Ratio of low-frequency to high-frequency power (LF-HF ratio) of HRV, the marker of SVI was found to be significantly correlated and linked with P300. Malondialdehyde and HOMA-IR were correlated with LF-HF ratio. CONCLUSION Treatment-na{\"{i}}ve patients with type 2 diabetes have SVI and considerable cognitive impairment. Insulin resistance and oxidative stress contribute to cognitive impairment, and SVI could be the physiologic link to cognitive impairment in treatment-na{\"{i}}ve patients with type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {Transient left ventricular dysfunction in patients under emotional stress, also known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, has been recognized as a distinct clinical entity. Recent studies have supported the concept notion that the cardiovascular system is regulated by cortical modulation. A network consisting of the insular cortex (Ic), anterior cingulate gyrus, and amygdala plays a crucial role in the regulation of the central autonomic nervous system in relation to emotional stress such as anxiety, fear and sadness. Because the Ic is located in the region of the middle cerebral arteries, its structure tends to be exposed to a higher risk of cerebrovascular disease. Ic damage has been associated with myocardial injury, increased brain natriuretic peptide, and the incidence of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Because Ic damage has been associated with increased sympathetic nervous system activity, Ic damage is suggested to have a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

abstract = {We investigated the effects of laughing and weeping induced by watching comedy and tragedy videos on mood and autonomic nervous function. Ten healthy female subjects volunteered for the experiment. Chest electrocardiogram and respiration curve were recorded before, after, and during watching a comedy or a tragedy video. We also asked them to fill out profiles of mood states (POMS) to evaluate their mood states while watching videos. Autonomic nervous function was estimated by spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). All subjects more or less laughed and wept while watching comedy and tragedy videos, respectively. Anger-hostility score of the POMS decreased and vigor score increased significantly after watching comedy videos, while depression-dejection score increased significantly after watching tragedy ones. Although both contents tended to increase a low to high frequency component ratio (LF/HF ratio) of HRV, the time course of responses was different. The LF/HF ratio which reflects cardiac sympathovagal balance increased immediately after they started watching comedy videos, and returned to the basal level right after they stopped watching, whereas the LF/HF ratio increased gradually to a lesser extent while watching tragedy videos. In contrast, the high-frequency component which reflects cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity gradually decreased while watching both videos but did not return to the basal level after watching tragedy ones. These results suggest that laughing has strong but transient effects on the autonomic nervous system, while weeping or feeling sad has moderate but sustained effects on it.},

The goal of the present study was to examine associations between suicide ideation and resting HF-HRV as well as HF-HRV reactivity in a diagnostically heterogeneous sample of adult outpatients with or without concurrent suicide ideation. Participants were N = 85 outpatients (67.1{\%} female; age: M = 38.8, SD = 13.72). HF-HRV reactivity was assessed using a sad film induction method. Associations between resting HF-HRV, HF-HRV reactivity and suicide ideation were analyzed using linear regression modeling – controlling for depression, anxiety and stress. HF-HRV reactivity towards the sad film, but not low resting HF-HRV baseline, was predictive of higher scores on suicidal ideation within the whole sample. In women, lower resting as well as perturbed HF-HRV reactivity was associated with higher scores on suicidal ideation. Results suggest that suicide ideators have a reduced capacity to regulate their response to stress.},

abstract = {Abnormal cardiovascular stress responses have been reported in Gulf War veterans with chronic fatigue. However, many of these veterans also suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which could potentially explain the reported abnormalities. To test this hypothesis, 55 Gulf veterans (GVs) with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or idiopathic chronic fatigue (ICF) were stratified into groups with (N=16) and without (N=39) comorbid PTSD, and were compared to healthy Gulf veterans (N=47) on cardiovascular responses to a series of stressors. The CFS/ICF with PTSD group had lower blood pressure responses to speech and arithmetic tasks, and more precipitous declines and slower recoveries in blood pressure after standing up than the controls. Similar trends in the CF/ICF group without PTSD were not significant, however. Both CFS/ICF groups had blunted increases in peripheral vascular resistance during mental tasks. However, only the veterans with comorbid PTSD had diminished cardiac output responses to the mental stressors and excessive vasodilatory responses to standing. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress were significant predictors of hypotensive postural responses, but only in veterans reporting a significant exposure to wartime stress. We conclude that comorbid PTSD contributes to dysregulation of cardiovascular responses to mental and postural stressors in Gulf veterans with medically unexplained fatiguing illness, and may provide a physiological basis for increased somatic complaints in Gulf veterans with symptoms of posttraumatic stress. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Brief versions of mental arithmetic tasks have been used widely in previous reactivity studies, and growing attention to more socially salient tasks has led to the increased use of public speaking tasks. However, psychophysiological adjustment during extended and repeated exposure to these tasks has not been delineated. In the present study, 52 healthy men worked on three 8-min presentations of public speaking and of mental arithmetic in a repeated measure design. Both tasks produced substantial cardiovascular, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and cortisol responses; public speaking produced greater changes. Repeated presentations of public speaking produced a stable pattern of cardiac activation, whereas repetitions of the mental arithmetic initially produced large cardiac responses that changed to a more vascular tonus across task periods. Both tasks increased negative moods. However, correlations between the endocrine, cardiovascular, and negative moods were significant only during the public speaking stressor. The public speaking task is a socially relevant experimental protocol for studying reactivity in the laboratory setting and elicits relatively high, stable, and homogeneous responses.},

abstract = {Background: Many traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) are associated with altered autonomic function. Inflammation may provide a link between risk factors, autonomic dysfunction, and CAD. We examined the association between heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function, and inflammation, measured by C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Methods: We examined 264 middle-aged male twins free of symptomatic CAD. All underwent ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring and 24-hour ultra low, very low, low, and high-frequency power were calculated using power spectral analysis. C-reactive protein and IL-6 were measured, and risk factors including age, smoking, hypertension, lipids, diabetes, body mass index (BMI), depression, and physical activity were assessed. Results: Physical activity, BMI, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, depression, and hypertension were directly associated with CRP and IL-6 and inversely associated with one or more HRV variables. There was a graded inverse relationship between all HRV parameters (except high frequency) and CRP and IL-6. After adjustment for age, BMI, activity, high-density lipoprotein, smoking, hypertension, depression, and diabetes, ultra low frequency and very low frequency remained significant predictors of CRP (P {\textless} .01). Conclusions: C-reactive protein is associated with decreased HRV, even after controlling for traditional CAD risk factors. Autonomic dysregulation leading to inflammation may represent one pathway through which traditional risk factors promote development of CAD. {\textcopyright} 2008 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with myocardial infarction (MI) with a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) have a poor prognosis, but the role of emotional stress in prognosis is not known. We hypothesized that emotional stress in these patients (1) is unrelated to the severity of cardiac disorder, (2) predicts cardiac events, and (3) is a function of basic personality traits. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients with MI (age, 41 to 69 years) with an LVEF of {\textless} or =50{\%} underwent psychological assessment at baseline. Patients and their families were contacted after 6 to 10 years (mean, 7.9 years); cardiac events were defined as cardiac death or nonfatal MI. Emotional distress was unrelated to the severity of cardiac disorder. At follow-up, 21 patients had experienced a cardiac event (13 fatal events). These events were related to LVEF of {\textless} or =30{\%}, poor exercise tolerance, previous MI, anxiety, anger, and depression (all P{\textless} or =.02). Patients with a distressed personality (type D; ie, the tendency to suppress negative emotions) were more likely to experience an event over time compared with non-type D patients (P=.00005). Cox proportional hazards analysis yielded LVEF of {\textless} or =30{\%} (relative risk, 3.0; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.2 to 7.7; P=.02) and type D (relative risk, 4.7; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.9 to 11.8; P=.001) as independent predictors. Anxiety, anger, and depression did not add to the predictive power of type D; these negative emotions were highly correlated and reflected the personality domain of negative affectivity. CONCLUSIONS: Personality influences the clinical course of patients with a decreased LVEF. Emotional distress in these patients is unrelated to disease severity but reflects individual differences in personality. Clinical trials should take a broad view of the target of intervention; assessment of LVEF and personality may identify patients at risk.},

abstract = {Background: Both race and social class influence cardiovascular outcomes, through mechanisms not yet fully understood. Minority race and lower social class are sources of chronic stress, which can alter autonomic nervous system function. Heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function, is also an important predictor of cardiovascular outcomes. Methods: To determine whether minority race/ethnicity and lower social class are associated with depressed HRV, we prospectively collected data on sociodemographic, clinical, psychological, and behavioral factors by survey in 360 outpatients undergoing ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Heart rate variability (24-hour) was measured by frequency domain analysis. Results: In unadjusted analysis, African Americans had lower HRV than whites, and individuals of lower social class as measured by education, occupation, and income had lower HRV than those of higher class. In multivariable analysis, both race and social class were independent predictors of ultralow frequency power after controlling for clinical and psychological factors. African Americans were 3.45 (95{\%} CI 1.74-6.98, P = .0004) times as likely as whites to have depressed HRV (ultralow frequency power, lowest tertile), and non-college graduates 2.94 (95{\%} CI, 1.71-5.14, P = .0001) times as likely as college graduates to have depressed HRV. Conclusions: Heart rate variability is lower in African Americans and individuals of lower social class, independent of the effects of measured clinical, psychological, or behavioral factors. This suggests that the adverse effects of minority race and lower social class on cardiovascular outcomes may be mediated by dysregulation of autonomic function. {\textcopyright} 2005, Mosby, Inc.

Early-life stressors, such as childhood abuse and early socioeconomic adversity, are linked to increased cardiovascular morbidity in adulthood. Our updated meta-analyses of prospective studies published until 2011 show a 1.5-fold (95{\%} confidence interval 1.2–1.9) increased risk of coronary heart disease among adults experiencing social isolation and a 1.3-fold (1.2–1.5) excess risk for workplace stress; adverse metabolic changes are one of the underlying plausible mechanisms. Stress, anger, and depressed mood can act as acute triggers of major cardiac events; the pooled relative risk of acute coronary syndrome onset being preceded by stress is 2.5 (1.8–3.5) in case-crossover studies. Stress is also implicated in the prognosis of cardiovascular disease and in the development of stress (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this meta-analytic study was to determine whether individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have higher levels of basal cardiovascular activity relative to comparable groups of individuals without PTSD. METHODS: Meta-analytic data methods were applied to 34 studies that gathered indicators of basal cardiovascular activity including: heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure on subjects diagnosed with PTSD and two types of comparison groups. In total, cardiovascular measures were analyzed for 2670 subjects across all studies. RESULTS: Results indicate that individuals with a current PTSD diagnosis have higher resting HR relative to both trauma-exposed individuals without a PTSD diagnosis and non-trauma-exposed individuals. The results also suggest that PTSD is associated with elevations in blood pressure; however, the effect sizes were smaller in magnitude than those obtained for heart rate. A subset analysis revealed that the effect sizes for comparisons on basal HR were greatest in studies with the most chronic PTSD samples. CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis supports previous qualitative reviews, finding a positive association between PTSD and basal cardiovascular activity. The discussion addresses possible mechanisms of action and the health-related implications of these findings.},

abstract = {Ageing is the primary risk factor for cognitive deterioration. Given that the cerebral blood flow (CBF) or regulation of cerebral circulation is attenuated in the elderly, it could be expected that ageing-induced cognitive deterioration may be affected by a decrease in CBF as a result of brain ischemia and energy depletion. CBF regulation associated with cerebral metabolism thus likely plays an important role in the preservation of cognitive function. However, in some specific conditions (e.g. during exercise), change in CBF does not synchronize with that of cerebral metabolism. Our recent study demonstrated that cognitive function was more strongly affected by changes in cerebral metabolism than by changes in CBF during exercise. Therefore, it remains unclear how an alteration in CBF or its regulation affects cognitive function. In this review, I summarize current knowledge on previous investigations providing the possibility of an interaction between regulation of CBF or cerebral metabolism and cognitive function.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Depression is a risk factor for mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), possibly as a result of altered autonomic nervous system (ANS) modulation of heart rate (HR) and rhythm. The purposes of this study were to determine: a) whether depressed patients are more likely to have an abnormal HR response (i.e., abnormal turbulence) to premature ventricular contractions (VPCs), and b) whether abnormal HR turbulence accounts for the effect of depression on increased mortality after AMI. METHODS Ambulatory electrocardiographic data were obtained from 666 (316 depressed, 350 nondepressed) patients with a recent AMI; 498 had VPCs with measurable HR turbulence. Of these, 260 had normal, 152 had equivocal, and 86 had abnormal HR turbulence. Patients were followed for up to 30 (median = 24) months. RESULTS Depressed patients were more likely to have abnormal HR turbulence (risk factor adjusted odds ratio = 1.8; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.0-3.0; p = .03) and have worse survival (odds ratio = 2.4; 95{\%} CI = 1.2-4.6; p = .02) than nondepressed patients. When HR turbulence was added to the model, the adjusted hazard ratio for depression decreased to 1.9 (95{\%} CI = 0.9-3.8; p = .08), and to 1.6 (95{\%} CI = 0.8-3.4; p = .18) when a measure of HR variability (LnVLF) was added. The hazard was found to differ over time with depression posing little risk for mortality in year 1 but greater risk in years 2 and 3 of the follow up. CONCLUSION ANS dysregulation may partially mediate the increased risk for mortality in depressed patients with frequent VPCs after an AMI.},

abstract = {Stress is present in everyday life in various forms and situations. Two stressors frequently investigated are physiological and psychosocial stress. Besides similar subjective and hormonal responses, it has been suggested that they also share common neural substrates. The current study used activation-likelihood-estimation meta-analysis to test this assumption by integrating results of previous neuroimaging studies on stress processing. Reported results are cluster-level FWE corrected. The inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the anterior insula (AI) were the only regions that demonstrated overlapping activation for both stressors. Analysis of physiological stress showed consistent activation of cognitive and affective components of pain processing such as the insula, striatum, or the middle cingulate cortex. Contrarily, analysis across psychosocial stress revealed consistent activation of the right superior temporal gyrus and deactivation of the striatum. Notably, parts of the striatum appeared to be functionally specified: the dorsal striatum was activated in physiological stress, whereas the ventral striatum was deactivated in psychosocial stress. Additional functional connectivity and decoding analyses further characterized this functional heterogeneity and revealed higher associations of the dorsal striatum with motor regions and of the ventral striatum with reward processing. Based on our meta-analytic approach, activation of the IFG and the AI seems to indicate a global neural stress reaction. While physiological stress activates a motoric fight-or-flight reaction, during psychosocial stress attention is shifted towards emotion regulation and goal-directed behavior, and reward processing is reduced. Our results show the significance of differentiating physiological and psychosocial stress in neural engagement. Furthermore, the assessment of deactivations in addition to activations in stress research is highly recommended.},

abstract = {Background: Recent studies have shown that depressive disorder is associated with impaired baroreceptor or baroreflex sensitivity, which is proposed to be a predisposing factor for sudden death in patients with manifest cardiac disease. These studies have not evaluated the afferent and efferent components of the cardiac baroreflex loop or other baroreflex mechanisms that regulate target processes (cardiac metabolism and blood pressure variability) related to the impairment. The objective of this study was to gain more insight into autonomic functioning in depressive disorder to more fully examine the potential basis for increased cardiac mortality. Methods: The subjects were 28 women and men with unipolar major depression who were taking antidepressant medications and who were in partial remission and free of cardiovascular or other serious disease, and 28 healthy control subjects matched for sex, age, and ethnicity. The two samples were compared for negative affective dispositions (anger expression, hostility, defensiveness, anxiety), spontaneous (closed-loop) baroreflex activity, heart rate, heart rate variability, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate-systolic blood pressure double product under resting conditions. Results: Depressed patients showed a general disposition to anger suppression coupled with higher hostility and anxiety, and lower defensiveness. The patients showed higher general sympathetic activity (high levels of blood pressure, low-frequency heart rate variability) and lower parasympathetic-related activity (high heart rate and reduced high frequency heart rate variability) with affected cardiac metabolism estimated by the double product. Depressed patients had lower baroreflex sensitivity related to a higher gain of the afferent component of the baroreflex without respective gain adjustment of its efferent component (reflex gain 'de-afferentation'). It was coupled with a compensatory higher number of effective baroreflex reactions (reflex gating 're-afferentation'). Antidepressant agents and depressed mood had additional independent effects on baroreflex sensitivity through the efferent component of the cardiac baroreflex loop. Conclusions: The data indicate that different baroreflex components and mechanisms may be impaired in patients with depression and may contribute to their increased cardiac risk. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Results from longitudinal cohort studies converge in illustrating that major depressive disorder (MDD) subsequently increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with about 80{\%}. The impact of MDD on cardiovascular health may be partly explained by mediating mechanisms such as unhealthy lifestyle (smoking, excessive alcohol use, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, therapy non-compliance) and unfavorable pathophysiological disturbances (autonomic, HPA-axis, metabolic and immuno-inflammatory dysregulations). A summary of the literature findings as well as relevant results from the large-scale Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (N = 2981) are presented. Persons with MDD have significantly worse lifestyles as well as more pathophysiological disturbances as compared to healthy controls. Some of these differences seem to be specific for (typical versus ‘atypical', or antidepressant treated versus drug-naive) subgroups of MDD patients. Alternative explanations are also present, namely undetected confounding, iatrogenic effects or ‘third factors' such as genetics.},

Methods: Heart rate variability was measured during 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring in 40 medically stable out-patients with documented coronary heart disease meeting current diagnostic criteria for major depression, and 32 nondepressed, but otherwise comparable, patients. Patients discontinued $\beta$-blockers and antidepressant medications at the time of study. Depressed patients were classified as mildly (n = 21) or moderately-to-severely depressed (n = 19) on the basis of Beck Depression Inventory scores. Results: There were no significant differences among the groups in age, gender, blood pressure, history of myocardial infarction, diabetes, or smoking. Heart rates were higher and nearly all indices of heart rate variability were significantly reduced in the moderately-to-severely versus the nondepressed group. Heart rates were also higher and mean values for heart rate variability lower in the mildly depressed group compared with the nondepressed group, but these differences did not attain statistical significance. Conclusion: The association of moderate to severe depression with reduced heart rate variability in patients with stable coronary heart disease may reflect altered cardiac autonomic modulation and may explain their increased risk for mortality.

This review considers the evidence for several behavioral and physiological mechanisms that might explain how depression increases the risk for incident coronary disease and for subsequent cardiac morbidity and mortality. The candidate mechanisms include: (1) antidepressant cardiotoxicity; (2) association of depression with cardiac risk factor such as cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and reduced functional capacity; (3) association of depression with greater coronary disease severity; (4) nonadherence to cardiac prevention and treatment regimens; (5) lower heart rate variability (HRV) reflecting altered cardiac autonomic tone; (6) increased platelet aggregation; and (7) inflammatory processes. Despite recent advances in our understanding of these potential mechanisms, further research is needed to determine how depression increases risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

We discuss research done after the publication of previous relevant systematic reviews, and survey currently funded research from the two most active funders in the field: the National Institutes of Health and the US Veterans Administration. We conclude that post-traumatic stress disorder is a risk factor for incident cardiovascular disease, and a common psychiatric consequence of cardiovascular disease events that might worsen the prognosis of the cardiovascular disease. There are many candidate mechanisms for the link between post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease, and several ongoing studies could soon point to the most important behavioural and physiological mechanisms to target in early phase intervention development. Similarly, targets are emerging for individual and environmental interventions that might offset the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder after cardiovascular disease events.},

abstract = {Low heart rate (HR) variability is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but the causes and mechanisms of this association are not well known. This prospective study was designed to test the hypothesis that reduced HR variability is related to progression of coronary atherosclerosis. Average HR and HR variability were analyzed in 12-hour ambulatory ECG recordings from 265 qualified patients participating in a multicenter study to evaluate the angiographic progression of coronary artery disease in patients with prior coronary artery bypass surgery and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations ({\textless}1.1 mmol/L). Participants were randomized to receive a placebo or gemfibrozil therapy. The progression of coronary atherosclerosis was estimated by quantitative, computer-assisted analysis of coronary artery stenoses from the baseline angiograms and from repeated angiograms performed an average of 32 months later. The progression of focal coronary atherosclerosis of the patients randomized to placebo therapy was more marked in the tertile with the lowest standard deviation of all normal to normal R-R intervals (SDNN, 74+/-13 ms; mean decrease in the per-patient minimum luminal diameter -0.17 mm; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], -0.23 to -0.12 mm) than in the middle tertile (SDNN, 107+/-7 ms; mean decrease -0.05 mm; 95{\%} CI, -0.08 to -0.01 mm) or highest tertile (SDNN, 145+/-25 ms; mean change 0.01 mm; 95{\%} CI, -0. 04 to 0.02 mm) (P{\textless}0.001 between the tertiles). This association was abolished by gemfibrozil. SDNN was lower (P{\textless}0.001) and minimum HR was faster (P{\textless}0.01) in the patients with marked progression than in those with regression of focal coronary atherosclerosis. In multiple regression analysis including HR variability, minimum HR, demographic and clinical variables, smoking, blood pressure, glucose, lipid measurements and lipid-modifying therapy, progression of focal coronary atherosclerosis was independently predicted by the SDNN (beta=0.24; P=0.0001). Low HR variability analyzed from ambulatory ECG predicts rapid progression of coronary artery disease. HR variability provided information on progression of focal coronary atherosclerosis beyond that obtained by traditional risk markers of atherosclerosis.},

Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) has been suggested as a possible explanation for this association. The purpose of this study was to determine if depression is associated with reduced HRV in patients with a recent MI. METHODS AND RESULTS Three hundred eighty acute MI patients with depression and 424 acute MI patients without depression were recruited. All underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring after hospital discharge. In univariate analyses, 4 indices of HRV were significantly lower in patients with depression than in patients without depression. Variables associated with HRV were then compared between patients with and without depression, and potential confounds were identified. These variables (age, sex, diabetes, and present cigarette smoking) were entered into an analysis of covariance model, followed by depression status. In the final model, all but one HRV index (high-frequency power) remained significantly lower in patients with depression than in patients without depression. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that greater autonomic dysfunction, as reflected by decreased HRV, is a plausible mechanism linking depression to increased cardiac mortality in post-MI patients.},

abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS Accumulating evidence suggests an association between coronary heart disease and risk for cognitive impairment or dementia, but no study has systematically reviewed this association. Therefore, we summarized the available evidence on the association between coronary heart disease and risk for cognitive impairment or dementia. METHODS Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were searched for all publications until 8th January 2016. Articles were included if they fulfilled the inclusion criteria: (1) myocardial infarction, angina pectoris or coronary heart disease (combination of both) as predictor variable; (2) cognition, cognitive impairment or dementia as outcome; (3) population-based study; (4) prospective (≥1 year follow-up), cross-sectional or case-control study design; (5) ≥100 participants; and (6) aged ≥45 years. Reference lists of publications and secondary literature were hand-searched for possible missing articles. Two reviewers independently screened all abstracts and extracted information from potential relevant full-text articles using a standardized data collection form. Study quality was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We pooled estimates from the most fully adjusted model using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS We identified 6,132 abstracts, of which 24 studies were included. A meta-analysis of 10 prospective cohort studies showed that coronary heart disease was associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment or dementia (OR = 1.45, 95{\%}CI = 1.21-1.74, p{\textless}0.001). Between-study heterogeneity was low (I2 = 25.7{\%}, 95{\%}CI = 0-64, p = 0.207). Similar significant associations were found in separate meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies for the individual predictors (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris). In contrast, meta-analyses of cross-sectional and case-control studies were inconclusive. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION This meta-analysis suggests that coronary heart disease is prospectively associated with increased odds of developing cognitive impairment or dementia. Given the projected worldwide increase in the number of people affected by coronary heart disease and dementia, insight into causal mechanisms or common pathways underlying the heart-brain connection is needed.},

abstract = {Measurement of heart rate variability (HRV) has become an important research tool for both clinical and basic scientists (1,2). The better reproducibility and the possibility of measuring long-range heart rate (HR) fluctuations are advantages of 24-h electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings over short-term recordings in the assessment of HRV (2). Long-range oscillations of HR determine a larger propor-tion of 24-h HRV than do short-term oscillations. This phenomenon can be demonstrated by plotting the (log) power to (log) frequency of HRV in the region of ultra-low-frequency (ULF) and very-low-frequency (VLF) power spectral bands, where an inverse power-law relationship (1/f dynamics) can be observed between the power and the See page 2271 frequency of R-R interval oscillations (2). Similar charac-teristics can also be observed at higher frequencies, except that small peaks in the spectrum exist at the frequency of spontaneous blood pressure oscillations and respiratory fre-quency (2). Origin of long-range HRV. Despite the documented prognostic information obtained by measurements of long-range HRV indexes from 24-h ECG recordings in various patient populations (3–5), the origin of these oscillations and the background of altered long-term HR dynamics are not well established. Lack of this information may be one of the many reasons why the measurement of 24-h HRV has not become a routine tool in clinical practice. From a mathematical viewpoint, long-range HRV, such as standard deviation of the 5-min mean R-R interval (SDANN) and ULF power, can be assumed to be larger when there are large temporal differences in the mean HR between time epochs more than 5 min apart from each other. Another factor that influences the magnitude of these HRV indexes is the average HR itself. The higher the average HR, the lower the HRV, even when the relative fluctuations of HR are similar at high and low HR, respectively. Despite these mathematical assumptions, the reasons for reduced long-range HRV during " free-running " ambulatory conditions have not been systematically studied. In this issue of the Journal, Roach et al. (6) report their results on the effects of changes in the daily activity levels on long-range HRV indexes such as SDANN and the ULF power spectral component (6). In their study, where activity was strictly controlled, SDANN and ULF power were lower during the " rest day " than the " activity day. " Furthermore, the relative contribution of each specific activity to the SDANN value was calculated. On the basis of their obser-vations, the authors conclude that long-range HRV indexes are partly dependent on the range of daily activity (6). Although changes in activity level have evident influences on various indexes of HRV, some caution should be observed in assuming that long-range HRV indexes could simply be used as " surrogates " of individual daily activity and functional state. Although SDANN and ULF power are influenced by the amount and duration of various daily activities, the type of physical activity may have divergent effects on measures of HRV. This is illustrated in Figure 1, where steady-state exercise (i.e., walking at a constant rate and regular activities in the standing position) resulted in a reduction of SDANN, whereas an incremental exercise with a long-term trend in HR resulted in an increase of SDANN. These examples from a previous study (7) dem-onstrate that there is complex interaction between the type and duration of physical activity, average HR, and the indexes of long-range HRV. On the basis of the study by Roach et al. (6) and the observations shown in Figure 1, it is evident that range, duration, and type of activity have obvious effects on various measures of HRV. However, these experiments do not give insight into whether the ULF oscillations of heart period are also determined by periodic or quasiperiodic oscillations of HR originating from an intrinsic regulatory system. Further studies will be needed to address this issue. The postulation of an intrinsic physiologic origin is supported by the notion of a dominant ULF power spectral component, even during strictly controlled resting conditions without any physical activity.},

This study was designed to re-investigate this topic with a larger N than has heretofore been used. Methods: The electrocardiogram was recorded during left and right ISAs in 73 subjects. Raw heart rate and heart rate variability were calculated. Results: Raw heart rate increased during inactivation of either hemisphere, but more so for the right hemisphere. Heart rate variability changes consistent with decreasing parasympa-thetic tone also were found to occur during either ISA, but to a significant degree, only during right ISA. Conclusions: The right hemisphere appears to have a greater role in cerebral regulation of cardiac function, perhaps by virtue of the modification of parasympathetic effects.},

abstract = {Context: Major depressive disorder (MDD) associated with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) increases the risk of mortality. Decreased heart rate variability (HRV), also a predictor of mortality, is reduced in patients with MDD after ACS, and has been suggested to be a mediator of MDD mortality after ACS. Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may reduce mortality post-ACS, little is known about their effects on HRV. Objective: To examine the influence of both sertraline and improvement in mood on HRV. Methods: The Sertraline Antidepressant Heart Attack Randomized Trial assessed HRV from 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram recordings at baseline in 290 patients and from a second recording in 258 of these patients 16 weeks after randomization to sertraline or placebo. Frequency domain measures of HRV included high-frequency power, low-frequency power, very low-frequency power, ultra low-frequency power, and total power. Depression severity was measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Clinical response was measured with the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement scale. Results: At baseline, prior episodes of MDD were associated with lower HRV. Sertraline significantly increased ultra low-frequency power, while improvement in mood was associated with higher low-frequency power independent of treatment. However, the expected recovery in HRV following ACS was not observed in patients with MDD. Higher ultra low-frequency during sertraline treatment and higher low-frequency power in patients whose mood improved resulted primarily from these measures decreasing in their comparison groups. Conclusions: Heart rate variability recovery is impaired in depressed patients after ACS. Previously reported differences in baseline HRV between patients with and without depression after ACS grew larger in the 16 weeks following a coronary event. Both sertraline treatment and symptomatic recovery from depression were associated with increased HRV compared with placebotreated and nonrecovered post-ACS control groups, respectively, but this results primarily from decreased HRV in the comparison groups.},

abstract = {Importance Depressive symptoms are associated with lower heart rate variability (HRV), an index of autonomic dysregulation, but the direction of the association remains unclear. Objective To investigate the temporal association between depression and HRV. Design, Settings, and Participants A longitudinal, cross-lagged twin difference study, with baseline assessments from March 2002 to March 2006 (visit 1) and a 7-year follow-up (visit 2) at an academic research center with participants recruited from a national twin registry. Twins (n = 166) from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, who served in the US military during the Vietnam War, and were discordant for depression at baseline were recruited. Main Outcomes and Measures At both visits, depressive symptoms were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and HRV was measured through 24-hour electrocardiogram monitoring. To assess the direction of the association, within-pair differences in multivariable mixed-effects regression models were examined, and standardized $\beta$ coefficients for both pathways were calculated. The associations were evaluated separately in monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Results In the final analytic sample (N = 146), all participants were men, 138 (95{\%}) were white, and the mean (SD) age was 54 (3) years at baseline. Results showed consistent associations between visit 1 HRV and visit 2 BDI score across all HRV domains and models ($\beta$ coefficients ranging from −0.14 to −0.29), which were not explained by antidepressants or other participant characteristics. The magnitude of the association was similar in the opposite pathway linking visit 1 BDI score to visit 2 HRV, with $\beta$ coefficients ranging from 0.05 to −0.30, but it was largely explained by antidepressant use. In stratified analysis by zygosity, significant associations were observed in monozygotic and dizygotic twins for the path linking visit 1 HRV to visit 2 BDI score, although the associations were slightly stronger in dizygotic twins. Conclusions and Relevance The association between depression and autonomic dysregulation, indexed by HRV, is bidirectional, with stronger evidence suggesting that autonomic function affects depression risk rather than vice versa. The opposite causal pathway from depression to lower HRV is mostly driven by antidepressant use. These findings highlight an important role of autonomic nervous system in the risk of depression and contribute new understanding of the mechanisms underlying the comorbidity of depression and cardiovascular disease.},

The present work aimed to prospectively explore the effects of depression and anxiety on the 10-year CVD incidence, in relation to other lifestyle determinants, as linking factors in the context of the ATTICA study. Study design/Main outcome measures: The ATTICA study is a population-based, health and nutrition prospective cohort study (2002–2012), during which 853 middle-aged participants without a history of CVD [453 men (aged 45 ± 13 years) and 400 women (aged 44 ± 18 years)], underwent psychological evaluations at enrollment. The latent trait of depression and anxiety combined measure was estimated and referred as “Psychological distress”; path analysis was applied to describe the relationships among the different factors. Results “Psychological distress” was positively associated with the 10-year CVD incidence (adjusted OR per 10 units: 1.4, 95{\%} CI: 1.1, 1.7). Three linking pathways were revealed: sedentariness, inflammation and metabolic syndrome. Moreover, “Psychological distress” mediated the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and CVD, with participants of low SES scoring higher on the psychological measure (adjusted linear regression coefficient b: −7.1, 95{\%} CI: −9.7, −4.5). Conclusions Lifestyle and clinical factors seem to link psychological distress with CVD development. Joint psychological assessments should be considered for inclusion in CVD preventive strategies, which should incorporate interventions for interrupting the linking pathways.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity. MEASUREMENTS The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as "0" (not at all) to "3" (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients. RESULTS As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score {\textgreater} or =10 had a sensitivity of 88{\%} and a specificity of 88{\%} for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples. CONCLUSION In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.},

The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study found that anger proneness was an independent risk factor for CHD among normotensive, middle-aged men and women. 3 A meta-analysis reviewing several major epidemiological studies concluded that depression is an independent risk factor in the development of CHD in initially healthy people, with an overall relative risk of 1.64. 4 Other studies have also shown that depression increases short and long term mortality risk in patients with known CHD. 5,6 Lack of social support also portends a poor prognosis in patients after myocardial infarction (MI). 7,8 For example, among MI survivors, those with low to moderate levels of perceived social support had a 1-year post-CHD mortality rate about twofold higher than those with high levels of social support. 9 Furthermore, there is an interaction between depression and social support in relation to MI survival. 9 Although epidemiologic evidence is indicative, the results of psychosocial interventions after MI have Abstract: There is mounting evidence to suggest that psychosocial factors, including anger proneness, depression and social isolation, are risk factors for cardiovascu-lar disease. Nevertheless, evidence relating these factors to peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and intermittent claudication remains sparse. Using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, we analyzed the relationship of psy-chosocial variables (Spielberger anger score, depression score from the Maastricht questionnaire, and a perceived social support scale) at study visit 2 with incident PAD (ankle-brachial index 0.9; a hospital discharge diagnosis of PAD, leg amputation, or leg revascularization procedures; or intermittent claudication). In 12 965 middle-aged adults with no prior history of PAD, 854 developed PAD over a mean follow-up time of 9.7 years, yielding an incidence rate of 6.8 per 1000 person years. A modest, monotonic dose-response, positive association between anger proneness and incident PAD was observed in a multivariable model: relative risk (RR) 1.15 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.99-1.38) in the moderate anger group and RR 1.38 (95{\%} CI 1.08-1.76) in the high anger group, compared with the low anger group. When compared with a low level of depressive symptoms, moderate and high levels of depressive symptoms were also associated with greater incident PAD, with multi-variable RRs of 1.20 (95{\%} CI 0.99-1.45) and 1.44 (95{\%} CI 1.19-1.74) respectively. There was no association of perceived level of social support with the occurrence of PAD. Anger proneness and depressive symptoms may be associated with the occurrence of PAD, as for other atherosclerotic syndromes. These findings may warrant confirmation in further studies and, if causal, could serve as a unique target for a PAD prevention trial.},

Co-morbid depression and/or anxiety is prevalent in 20{\%} of patients with cardiovascular disease, which may be either transient or chronic. Distress, such as depression, reduces adherence, serves as a barrier to behaviour change and the adoption of a healthy lifestyle, and increases the risk that patients drop out of cardiac rehabilitation, impacting on patients' quality of life, risk of hospitalisation and mortality. Hence it is paramount to identify this subset of high-risk patients in clinical practice. This review provides a general overview of the prevalence of selected psychosocial risk factors, their impact on patient-reported and clinical outcomes, and bio-logical and behavioural mechanisms that may explain the association between psychosocial factors and health outcomes. The review also provides recommendations on which self-report screening measures to use to identify patients at high risk due to their psychosocial profile, and the effectiveness of available trials that target these risk factors. Despite challenges and barriers associated with screening of patients combined with appropriate treatment, it is paramount that we treat not only the heart but also the mind in order to improve the quality of care and patient and clinical outcomes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to investigate associations between psychosocial risk factors, including social isolation, anger and depressive symptoms, and heart rate variability in healthy women. METHODS: The study group consisted of 300 healthy women (median age 57.5 years) who were representative of women living in the greater Stockholm area. For the measurement of social isolation, a condensed version of the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List was used and household size assessed. Anger was measured by the anger scales previously used in the Framingham study and depressive symptoms by a questionnaire derived from Pearlin. Health behaviors were measured by means of standard questionnaires. From 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, both time and frequency domain measures were obtained: SDNN index (mean of the SDs of all normal to normal intervals for all 5-minute segments of the entire recording), VLF power (very low frequency power), LF power (low frequency power), HF power (high frequency power), and the LF/HF ratio (low frequency by high frequency ratio) were computed. RESULTS: Social isolation and inability to relieve anger by talking to others were associated with decreased heart rate variability. Depressive symptoms were related only to the LF/HF ratio. Adjusting for age, menopausal status, exercise and smoking habits, history of hypertension, and BMI did not substantially change the results. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest heart rate variability to be a mediating mechanism that could explain at least part of the reported associations between social isolation, suppressed anger, and health outcomes.},

abstract = {Background Many anecdotes and several uncontrolled case series have suggested that emotionally stressful events, and more specifically, anger, immediately precede and appear to trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction. However, controlled studies to determine the relative risk of myocardial infarction after episodes of anger have not been reported. Methods and Results We interviewed 1623 patients (501 women) an average of 4 days after myocardial infarction. The interview identified the time, place, and quality of myocardial infarction pain and other symptoms, the estimated usual frequency of anger during the previous year, and the intensity and timing of anger and other potentially triggering factors during the 26 hours before the onset of myocardial infarction. Anger was assessed by the onset anger scale, a single-item, seven-level, self-report scale, and the state anger subscale of the State-Trait Personality Inventory. Occurrence of anger in the 2 hours preceding the onset of myocardial infarction was compared with its expected frequency using two types of self-matched control data based on the case-crossover study design. The onset anger scale identified 39 patients with episodes of anger in the 2 hours before the onset of myocardial infarction. The relative risk of myocardial infarction in the 2 hours after an episode of anger was 2.3 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.7 to 3.2). The state anger subscale corroborated these findings with a relative risk of 1.9 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.7). Regular users of aspirin had a significantly lower relative risk (1.4; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.8 to 2.6) than nonusers (2.9; 95{\%} confidence interval, 2.0 to 4.1) (P{\textless}.05). Conclusions Episodes of anger are capable of triggering the onset of acute myocardial infarction, but aspirin may reduce this risk. A better understanding of the manner in which external events trigger the onset of acute cardiovascular events may lead to innovative preventive strategies aimed at severing the link between these external stressors and their pathological consequences.},

HRV is understudied in the context of depression and anxiety in young people (10–24 years old). Main objectives: (1) describe the nature and breadth of reviewed studies; and (2) synthesize main findings in the context of clinical and non-clinical populations of young people with depression and/or anxiety. Methods The Arksey and O'Malley methodology was utilized for this scoping review. CINHAL, EMBASE, Medline, PsychInfo, Scopus, Web of Science, as well as grey literature, were searched. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full papers for inclusion. A total of 20 citations were included in the final review (19 citations peer-reviewed journal articles, 1 journal abstract). Numerical and thematic analysis was used to summarize study findings. Results In clinical populations of either depression or anxiety, HRV was lower compared to controls. In non-clinical populations of either depression or anxiety, HRV was found to be lower in those who reported more depression or anxiety symptoms. Limitations The quality of the reviewed articles was not assessed which limits the ability to generate conclusions regarding study findings. Conclusion Changes in HRV were found across the spectrum of clinical and non-clinical populations of young people with depression or anxiety. Neurophysiological research on depression and anxiety in young people can act as a first step to understanding how physiological flexibility (i.e. HRV) is related to psychological flexibility (i.e. adaptive or maladaptive responses to life events).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiac autonomic dysfunction has been associated with cognitive impairment, but the underlying pathogenesis is complex and cerebral white matter lesions (WMLs) might be implicated. METHODS: Time and frequency heart rate variability (HRV) and visual rating of WMLs were carried out in 42 patients with mild cognitive impairment. RESULTS: After adjustment for relevant demographic and clinical characteristics, including left ventricular mass, reduced HRV indices of parasympathetic (root mean square of successive difference of RR intervals, RMSSD) and sympathetic modulation (low-frequency [LF] power) were associated with increased WML score (RMSSD: B -0.30, 95{\%} CI -0.52 to -0.08, p = .01; LF: B -0.24, 95{\%} CI -0.46 to -0.02, p = .05). In a multiple-adjusted model, RMSSD was the major independent predictor of WMLs (B -0.35, 95{\%} CI -0.57 to -0.13, p = .002). CONCLUSION: The evidence for an independent association of cardiac autonomic dysfunction with WMLs might suggest its role in the pathogenesis of WMLs.},

abstract = {The intimate connection between the brain and the heart was enunciated by Claude Bernard over 150 years ago. In our neurovisceral integration model we have tried to build on this pioneering work. In the present paper we further elaborate our model. Specifically we review recent neuroanatomical studies that implicate inhibitory GABAergic pathways from the prefrontal cortex to the amygdala and additional inhibitory pathways between the amygdala and the sympathetic and parasympathetic medullary output neurons that modulate heart rate and thus heart rate variability. We propose that the default response to uncertainty is the threat response and may be related to the well known negativity bias. We next review the evidence on the role of vagally mediated heart rate variability (HRV) in the regulation of physiological, affective, and cognitive processes. Low HRV is a risk factor for pathophysiology and psychopathology. Finally we review recent work on the genetics of HRV and suggest that low HRV may be an endophenotype for a broad range of dysfunctions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Objective To examine the independent association between heart rate variability (HRV) and cognitive performance , in a nationally representative population study of older adults. Methods Cross-sectional analysis of wave 1 data from the Irish longitudinal study on ageing (TILDA) was performed. A subset of 4,763 participants who underwent ECG recording during resting and paced breathing periods were used for the analysis. HRV indices were divided into quintiles for comparison of values and cognitive performance was defined using the Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA) score. Multivariate linear regression was used to model the association between cognition and different quintiles of each HRV index, after adjustment for covariates. Results The mean age was 61.7 ± 8.3 years and 2,618 (55 {\%}) were female. Lower quintiles of SDNN (P = 0.01-paced), LF (P = 0.001-paced), and LF:HF ratio (P = 0.049-paced) were significantly associated with lower MOCA scores (during both recording periods), independent of confounders. Sub-domains of MOCA responsible for the relationship were predominantly memory recall and language. Interpretation Reduced HRV is significantly associated with lower cognitive performance at a population level in people aged 50 and older. This further strengthens the relationship between autonomic dysfunction and cognitive disorders.},

abstract = {An individual's susceptibility to psychological and physical disorders associated with chronic stress exposure, for example, cardiovascular and infectious disease, may also be predicted by their reactivity to acute stress. One factor associated with both stress resilience and health outcomes is personality. An understanding of how personality influences responses to acute stress may shed light upon individual differences in susceptibility to chronic stress-linked disease. This study examined the relationships between personality and acute responses to stress in 125 healthy adults, using hierarchical linear regression. We assessed personality traits using the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ-BF), and responses to acute stress (cortisol, heart rate, blood pressure, mood) using a standardized laboratory psychosocial stress task, the Trier Social Stress Test. Individuals with high Negative Emotionality exhibited greater emotional distress and lower blood pressure responses to the Trier Social Stress Test. Individuals with high agentic Positive Emotionality exhibited prolonged heart rate responses to stress, whereas those with high communal Positive Emotionality exhibited smaller cortisol and blood pressure responses. Separate personality traits differentially predicted emotional, cardiovascular, and cortisol responses to a psychosocial stressor in healthy volunteers. Future research investigating the association of personality with chronic stress-related disease may provide further clues to the relationship between acute stress reactivity and susceptibility to disease. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = {Associations between autonomic nervous system health and cognitive performance have been described in different populations. Autonomic disturbances are a common phenomenon in patients post stroke. Little is known about the relationship between post stroke disturbances of the autonomic nervous system and the commonly occurring disturbances of cognitive functions revealed by victims of stroke. To assess the association between heart rate variability (HRV) and cognitive performance among patients post ischemic stroke and healthy age-matched controls, 13 patients post first-ever ischemic stroke aged 40–80 years and 15 age-matched healthy controls were evaluated. HRV was monitored during sustained handgrip, while breathing at a rate of six breaths per minute, while performing the serial-3 subtraction task sitting at rest, and while cycling. Patients post stroke had greater error rate in the serial-3 subtraction task, and lower HRV (both at rest and during task performance) relative to healthy controls (at rest 26 ms [10–53] vs. 43 ms [29–88]). The HRV of stroke patients showed less sensitivity to changes in testing conditions, and also failed to show the correlation with cognitive performance exhibited by the healthy subjects. Stroke patients experience autonomic nervous system dysfunction in parallel to their motor and cognitive impairments. Too often only the latter receive appropriate treatment consideration in the rehabilitation setting. The current results, and earlier research, point to the importance of focusing clinical attention to the status of the autonomic nervous system, as amelioration of its functioning is likely to enhance motor and cognitive functioning as well.

abstract = {The influence of acute psychological stress on cardiovascular disease is an emerging public health concern. Identification of brain mechanisms underlying this may aid in the discovery of possible treatments. Acute psychological stress may induce arteri- olar vasoconstriction and reduce blood flow to vital organs. We hypothesized that functional changes in brain regions involved with memory and autonomic/emotional regulation are implicated in the vasoconstrictive stress response, including the me- dial prefrontal cortex (anterior cingulate), insula, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Subjects with a history of coronary artery disease (N = 59) underwent measurement of microvascular vasomotor tone with the EndoPAT device and O–15 positron emis- sion tomography (PET) imaging of the brain during exposure to mental stress and control conditions. The peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) ratio was calculated as the mean peripheral vasomotor tone during stress divided by the mean tone during rest. Whole brain contrasts were performed between groups above and below the median PAT ratio, and significant contrasts were defined with cutoff p {\textless} 0.005. Stress‐induced peripheral vasoconstriction (below median PAT ratio) was associated with increased stress activation in insula and parietal cortex, and decreased activation in the medial prefrontal cortex with stress tasks compared to control tasks. These findings demonstrate that stress‐induced vasoreactivity is associated with changes in brain responses to stress in areas involved in emotion and autonomic regulation. These findings have important implications on possible treatments for mental stress‐ induced vascular toxicity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased research attention is being paid to the negative impact of anger on coronary heart disease (CHD). METHODS AND RESULTS: This study examined prospectively the association between trait anger and the risk of combined CHD (acute myocardial infarction [MI]/fatal CHD, silent MI, or cardiac revascularization procedures) and of "hard" events (acute MI/fatal CHD). Participants were 12 986 black and white men and womenenrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities study. In the entire cohort, individuals with high trait anger, compared with their low anger counterparts, were at increased risk of CHD in both event categories. The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) (95{\%} CI) was 1.54 (95{\%} CI 1.10 to 2.16) for combined CHD and 1.75 (95{\%} CI 1.17 to 2.64) for "hard" events. Heterogeneity of effect was observed by hypertensive status. Among normotensive individuals, the risk of combined CHD and of "hard" events increased monotonically with increasing levels of trait anger. The multivariate-adjusted HR of CHD for high versus low anger was 2.20 (95{\%} CI 1.36 to 3.55) and for moderate versus low anger was 1.32 (95{\%} CI 0.94 to 1.84). For "hard" events, the multivariate-adjusted HRs were 2.69 (95{\%} CI 1.48 to 4.90) and 1.35 (95{\%} CI 0.87 to 2.10), respectively. No statistically significant association between trait anger and incident CHD risk was observed among hypertensive individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Proneness to anger places normotensive middle-aged men and women at significant risk for CHD morbidity and death independent of the established biological risk factors.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Depression is an established risk factor for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), with an impact on cardiac prognosis; nonetheless, the literature disagrees on the role played by anxiety. No study has evaluated this relationship in a cardiac population with no history of depression and after their first diagnosis of ACS. The aim of this study is to explore these associations without the confounding role of long-lasting heart disease or psychiatric illnesses. METHOD Two hundred sixty-six patients with no history of depression completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorder at baseline and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months follow-up after their first diagnosis of ACS. During the follow-up period, we collected information regarding the major adverse cardiac events. RESULTS Developing a first-ever depressive episode, in a proportional hazard model, was associated with almost 3 times the risk of a recurrent cardiac event (odds ratio = 2.590, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] [1.321, 5.078], p = .006). Furthermore, a moderation analysis revealed that increasing levels of baseline anxiety had opposing effects on cardiac outcomes, being protective only in those who did not develop incident depression (B = -0.0824, 95{\%} CI [-0.164, -0.005], p = .048). No dose-response effect between depressive or anxious symptoms and cardiac outcomes emerged. CONCLUSION Our results confirm the detrimental effect of depression on cardiac prognosis in a selected population and suggest that anxiety after the first diagnosis of ACS might have different roles depending on the illness' course.

abstract = {Background: The direction of the association between inflammation and depressive symptoms remains inconsistent. The objective of this study was to evaluate the temporal relationship between inflammation and depressive symptoms, and to assess the role of genetic factors on this association. Methods: In this longitudinal cross-lagged twin difference study, we examined 166 (83 pairs) middle-aged male twins recruited from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, who were assessed at baseline and after 7 years of follow-up. We assayed plasma levels of two inflammatory biomarkers, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) and measured depressive symptoms using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI). To evaluate the direction of the association, we constructed multivariable mixed-effects regression models and calculated standardized beta-coefficients to compare the strength of the within-pair association for both pathways. We then conducted a stratified analysis by zygosity and assessed the associations in monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs separately. Results: The 166 twins were 95{\%} white and had a mean (SD) age of 54 (3) years at baseline. The cross-lagged analysis showed significant and positive associations from visit 1 IL-6 to visit 2 BDI across all models (beta-coefficients ranging from 0.18 to 0.22). However, the opposite pathway (visit 1 BDI to visit 2 IL-6) was not significant after adjusting for confounding factors. In contrast, visit 1 BDI was significantly associated with visit 2 CRP in all models (beta-coefficients ranging from 0.23 to 0.33), while the opposite pathway (visit 1 CRP to visit 2 BDI) showed no significant association. When stratifying by zygosity, significant associations from IL-6 to depression were only seen in monozygotic twins, but associations from depression to CRP were more robust in dizygotic twins, which implies that genetic factors may play a role in this association. Conclusions: The association between inflammation and depression may be bidirectional. Elevated IL-6 levels are more likely to be a risk factor of depression rather than a consequence, while the opposite may be true for elevated CRP. The biological underpinnings of these bidirectional pathways need further evaluation.},

The sudden death then occurred in a setting of acute arousal engendered by increased work and activity or circumstances precipitating reactions of anxiety or anger.

abstract = {Whether anxiety is a risk factor for a range of cardiovascular diseases is unclear. We aimed to determine the association between anxiety and a range of cardiovascular diseases. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for cohort studies that included participants with and without anxiety, including subjects with anxiety, worry, posttraumatic stress disorder, phobic anxiety, and panic disorder. We examined the association of anxiety with cardiovascular mortality, major cardiovascular events (defined as the composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, coronary heart disease, and heart failure), stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. We identified 46 cohort studies containing 2,017,276 participants and 222,253 subjects with anxiety. Anxiety was associated with a significantly elevated risk of cardiovascular mortality (relative risk [RR] 1.41, CI 1.13 to 1.76), coronary heart disease (RR 1.41, CI 1.23 to 1.61), stroke (RR 1.71, CI 1.18 to 2.50), and heart failure (RR 1.35, CI 1.11 to 1.64). Anxiety was not significantly associated with major cardiovascular events or atrial fibrillation although CIs were wide. Phobic anxiety was associated with a higher risk of coronary heart disease than other anxiety disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder was associated with a higher risk of stroke. Results were broadly consistent in sensitivity analyses. Anxiety disorders are associated with an elevated risk of a range of different cardiovascular events, including stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and cardiovascular death. Whether these associations are causal is unclear.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Vital exhaustion (VE), a construct defined as lack of energy, increased fatigue and irritability, and feelings of demoralisation, has been associated with cardiovascular events. We sought to examine the relation between VE and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. METHODS The ARIC Study is a predominately biracial cohort of men and women, aged 45-64 at baseline, initiated in 1987 through random sampling in four US communities. VE was measured using the Maastricht questionnaire between 1990 and 1992 among 13 923 individuals. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the hazard of out-of-hospital SCD across tertiles of VE scores. RESULTS Through 2012, 457 SCD cases, defined as a sudden pulseless condition presumed due to a ventricular tachyarrhythmia in a previously stable individual, were identified in ARIC by physician record review. Adjusting for age, sex and race/centre, participants in the highest VE tertile had an increased risk of SCD (HR 1.48, 95{\%} CI 1.17 to 1.87), but these findings did not remain significant after adjustment for established cardiovascular disease risk factors (HR 0.94, 95{\%} CI 0.73 to 1.20). CONCLUSIONS Among participants of the ARIC study, VE was not associated with an increased risk for SCD after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors.},

abstract = {Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk. We tested the hypothesis that PTSD patients have augmented sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and hemodynamic reactivity during mental stress, and impaired arterial baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). 14 otherwise healthy Veterans with combat-related PTSD were compared to 14 matched Controls without PTSD. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), continuous blood pressure (BP), and electrocardiography were measured at baseline, and during two types of mental stress: combat-related mental stress using virtual reality combat exposure (VRCE); and noncombat related stress using mental arithmetic (MA). Cold pressor test (CPT) was administered for comparison. BRS was tested using pharmacologic manipulation of BP via the Modified Oxford technique at rest and during VRCE. Blood samples were analysed for inflammatory biomarkers. Baseline characteristics, MSNA and hemodynamics were similar between the groups. In PTSD versus Controls, MSNA (+8.2 ± 1.0 vs +1.2 ± 1.3 bursts/min P {\textless} 0.001) and heart rate (HR) responses (+3.2 ± 1.1 vs −2.3 ± 1.0 beats/min, P = 0.003) were significantly augmented during VRCE. Similarly, in PTSD versus Controls, MSNA (+21.0 ± 2.6 vs +6.7 ± 1.5 bursts/min, P {\textless} 0.001) and diastolic BP responses (+6.3 ± 1.0 vs +3.5 ± 1.0 mmHg, P = 0.011) were significantly augmented during MA, but not during CPT (P = NS). In the PTSD group, sympathetic BRS (-1.2 ± 0.2 vs -2.0 ± 0.3 BI mmHg−1, P = 0.026) and cardiovagal BRS (9.5 ± 1.4 vs 23.6 ± 4.3 ms mmHg−1, P = 0.008) were significantly blunted at rest. PTSD patients had significantly higher hs-CRP levels compared to Controls (2.1 ± 0.4 vs 1.0 ± 0.3 mg L−1, P = 0.047). Augmented SNS and hemodynamic responses to mental stress, blunted BRS, and inflammation may contribute to increased CV risk in PTSD.},

In a longitudinal cohort of 2160 combat troops in the 2-phase Marine Resiliency Study (MRS), they examined whether predeployment HRV predicts postdeployment PTSD among US Marines being deployed for combat. The investigators found that the low- to high-frequency (LF:HF) HRV ratio predicted postdeployment PTSD, evenafter adjusting for differences in deployment-related stressors. The study by Minassian et al, however, has several weaknesses that limit its ability to infer a causal association between a higher LF:HF HRV ratio and the incidence of postdeployment PTSD. The study by Minassian et al, along with other studies from the MRS cohort, provide important initial data to help identify key determinants and prognostic indicators of PTSD after a major trauma.

A decrease in ultra- low frequency power ({\textless} 0.0033 Hz) is known to be associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular mortality in humans. Twenty-four-hour ECG was recorded in 29 patients with panic disorder and 23 normal controls using Holter records. Data for 20 h and also 20 000 s of awake and 20 000 s of sleep periods were analyzed using spectral analysis to quantify absolute and relative heart-period variability in ultra low (ULF: {\textless} 0.0033 Hz), very low (VLF: 0.0033-0.04 Hz), low (LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz) and high (HF: 0.15-0.5 Hz) frequency bands. The patients with panic disorder had significantly lower total and absolute ULF power, which was more pronounced during sleep. The patients also had significantly lower relative ULF power and significantly higher relative LF power during sleep. There was a significant increase of relative LF power from awake to sleep period only in the patient group. The decrease in total and ULF power may increase the risk of mortality and sudden arrhythmic death in patients with panic disorder if they experience a cardiac event. The higher relative LF power during sleep also suggests a possible higher sympathetic drive in the patients during sleep.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) is the consequence of various influences of the autonomic nervous system on heart rate. The influence of the respiration rate on HRV is well accepted (respiratory sinus arrhythmia: RSA). The extent of different respira- tion rates on HRV however, is not greatly appreciated. In our study, we stored a modified chest wall electrocardiogram on magnetic tape (Tracker, Reynolds) for later analysis (Pathfinder IV, RR-tools, Reynolds). 15 volunteers performed controlled respiration at six different 6 min-intervals: below the low-frequency range (LF) of the power spectrum (0.03 Hz), within LF (0.08, 0.10 and 0.13 Hz), within the high-frequency range (HF; 0.25 Hz), and above HF (0.50 Hz). HRV was expressed in the time domain in terms of standard deviation (SDNN), root mean square successive difference (RMSSD) and the percentage of differences between adjacent normal RR intervals that are {\textgreater} 50 ms (pNN50). After fast Fourier transformation, HRV was expressed in the frequency domain in terms of LF power (0.05–0.15 Hz), HF power (0.15–0.45 Hz), and the ratio (R) of LF to HF. Heart rate (72 ± 11 min-1) remained unchanged throughout the protocol, indicating a steady haemodynamic state. HRV differed up to 33 {\%} in SDNN, 37 {\%} in RMSSD and 75 {\%} in pNN50 between the different respiration rates. LF power differed up to 72 {\%} (p {\textless} 0.10), HF power up to 36 {\%} and R up to 48 {\%} (p {\textless} 0.10). Reproducibility seems satisfactory for the short-term analysis. Respiration rate-induced changes in the time domain meas- urements were not significant. Because of the large scatter of RMSSD and pNN50, we suggest SDNN as a reliable, easily accessible, and illustrative measurement for assessment of HRV. Respiration clearly affected the frequency domain measure- ments of HRV via shifts in the respiratory sinus arrhythmia. If major changes in respiration rate are to be expected, these should be interpreted with caution. On the other hand, the characteristic RSA-induced shifts in the frequency range could possibly be useful to determine respiration rate in freely moving individuals.

abstract = {Depression is common in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and is a risk factor for cardiac morbidity and mortality in these patients. Depression is associated with autonomic nervous system dysfunction, which may at least partially explain this increased risk. Low heart rate variability (HRV), which reflects excessive sympathetic and/or inadequate parasympathetic modulation of heart rate, is a strong predictor of mortality in patients with CHD. Most studies-both in patients with stable CHD and in patients with a recent acute coronary event-have found HRV to be lower in depressed patients than in their nondepressed counterparts. This manuscript provides an overview of this literature and concludes that HRV may account for a substantial part of the risk associated with depression in CHD.},

Between 2002 and 2010, we studied 465 middle-aged twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry who were free from cardiovascular disease. PTSD was diagnosed using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, and CIMT was measured by ultrasound. Mixed-effects regression models were used to examine individual, between-pair, and within-pair associations. Approximately 13{\%} of participants met the criteria for PTSD, and 45{\%} served in the Vietnam Theater. PTSD was associated with 32.7 $\mu$m higher CIMT (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.9, 64.5) after adjustment for confounders. The average CIMT for the pair increased by 59.7 $\mu$m for each additional twin with PTSD (95{\%} CI: 15.9, 104.2). We found no significant within-pair differences in CIMT when comparing PTSD-discordant co-twins. Results for combat exposure were similar, but its association with CIMT weakened after adjustment for PTSD (95{\%} CI: 7.0, 45.3). Among Vietnam War-era veterans, combat exposure and PTSD are associated with CIMT, though the associations are largely mediated by shared childhood factors.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE—Heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function, has been associated with cognitive function, but studies are conflicting. Previous studies have also not controlled for familial and genetic influences. METHODS—We performed power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory ECG's in 416 middle-aged male twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Memory and learning were measured by verbal and visual selective reminding tests (SRT). Mixed-effect regression models were used to calculate associations between and within twin pairs, while adjusting for covariates. RESULTS—The mean age (SD) was 55 (2.9) years. A statistically significant positive association was found between measures of HRV and verbal, but not visual, SRT scores. The most statistically significant unadjusted association was found between very low frequency (VLF) HRV and verbal total recall SRT, such that each logarithm of increase in VLF was associated with an increased verbal SRT score of 4.85 points (p=0.002). The association persisted despite adjustment for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors, and after accounting for familial, and genetic factors by comparing twins within pairs. A significant interaction was found between post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and HRV, such that total power and ultra low frequency were associated with SRT in twins (n=362) without PTSD, but not in those with PTSD. CONCLUSION—In conclusion, lower frequency spectra of HRV are associated with verbal, but not visual, learning and memory, particularly in subjects without PTSD. This association may indicate that autonomic nervous system dysregulation plays a role in cognitive decline.},

Nineteen patients with angiographically documented CAD and either major or minor depression were compared with a sample of nondepressed CAD patients according to age, sex, and smoking status. All patients underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring, and the standard deviation of all normal-to-normal intervals was used as the primary index of HR variability. HR variability was significantly lower in depressed than nondepressed patients (90 ± 35 vs 117 ± 26 ms; p {\textless} 0.01), even after adjusting for relevant covariates.

Although 80{\%} of the physicians reported that routine use of the PHQ would be useful, new management actions were initiated or planned for only 117 (32{\%}) of the 363 patients with 1 or more PHQ diagnoses not previously recognized.ConclusionOur study suggests that the PHQ has diagnostic validity comparable to the original clinician-administered PRIME-MD, and is more efficient to use.},

abstract = {Five days of integrative body-mind training (IBMT) improves attention and self-regulation in comparison with the same amount of relaxation training. This paper explores the underlying mechanisms of this finding. We measured the physiological and brain changes at rest before, during, and after 5 days of IBMT and relaxation training. During and after training, the IBMT group showed significantly better physiological reactions in heart rate, respiratory amplitude and rate, and skin conductance response (SCR) than the relaxation control. Differences in heart rate variability (HRV) and EEG power suggested greater involvement of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in the IBMT group during and after training. Imaging data demonstrated stronger subgenual and adjacent ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity in the IBMT group. Frontal midline ACC theta was correlated with high-frequency HRV, suggesting control by the ACC over parasympathetic activity. These results indicate that after 5 days of training, the IBMT group shows better regulation of the ANS by a ventral midfrontal brain system than does the relaxation group. This changed state probably reflects training in the coordination of body and mind given in the IBMT but not in the control group. These results could be useful in the design of further specific interventions.},

abstract = {Background: Studies have linked depression to sudden death and serious cardiovascular events in patients with preexisting cardiac illness. Recent studies have shown decreased vagal function in cardiac patients with depression and depressed patients without cardiac illness. Methods: We compared 20-hour, sleeping, and awake heart period variability measures using spectral analysis, fractal dimension, and symbolic dynamics in two patient groups with major depression and ischemic heart disease (mean age 59-60 years) before and after 6 weeks of paroxetine or nortriptyline treatment. Results: Spectral measures showed decreases in awake and sleeping total power (TP: 0.0-0.5 Hz), ultra low frequency power (ULF: 0-0.0033 Hz), very low frequency power (VLF: 0.0033-0.04 Hz), and low-frequency power (LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz) for nortriptyline condition and a decrease in high-frequency power (HF: 0.15-0.5 Hz) for the awake condition in patients who received nortriptyline. A measure of nonlinear complexity, WC-100, significantly increased after paroxetine during the awake condition. Conclusions: These findings suggest that nortriptyline has stronger vagolytic effects on cardiac autonomic function compared with paroxetine, which is in agreement with previous clinical and preclinical reports. Paroxetine may have some cardio-protective effects, especially in cardiac patients. {\textcopyright} 2002 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Observational studies have suggested that psychological stress increases the incidence of sudden cardiac death. Whether emotional or physical stressors can trigger spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias in patients at risk has not been systematically evaluated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) were given diaries to record levels of defined mood states and physical activity, using a 5-point intensity scale, during 2 periods preceding spontaneously occurring ICD shocks (0 to 15 minutes and 15 minutes to 2 hours) and during control periods 1 week later. ICD-stored electrograms confirmed the rhythm at the time of shock. A total of 107 confirmed ventricular arrhythmias requiring shock were reported by 42 patients (33 men; mean age, 65 years; 78{\%} had coronary artery disease) between August 1996 and September 1999. In the 15 minutes preceding shock, an anger level {\textgreater} or =3 preceded 15{\%} of events compared with 3{\%} of control periods (P{\textless}0.04; odds ratio, 1.83; 95{\%} confidence intervals, 1.04 to 3.16) Other mood states (anxiety, worry, sadness, happiness, challenge, feeling in control, or interest) did not differ. Patients were more physically active preceding shock than in control periods. Anger and physical activity were independently associated with the preshock period. CONCLUSIONS: Anger and physical activity can trigger ventricular arrhythmias in patients with ICDs. Future investigations of therapies aimed at blocking a response to these stressors may decrease ventricular arrhythmias and shocks in these patients.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine in a nonclinical sample of preadolescents the possibility that somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms are differentially related with the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Depression is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Dysregulation of the ANS and the HPA axis have been proposed as underlying mechanisms. Several studies suggest that only a subset of the depression symptoms account for associations with cardiovascular prognosis. METHODS: Self-reported somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms were examined in relationship to heart rate variability (HRV), spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), and the cortisol awakening response (CAR) in 2049 preadolescents (mean age = 11.1 years; 50.7{\%} = girls) from the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS). RESULTS: Physiological measurements were not associated with the overall measure of depressive symptoms. Somatic depressive symptoms were negatively related to HRV and BRS, and positively to the CAR; cognitive-affective depressive symptoms were positively related to HRV and BRS, and negatively to the CAR. Associations with the CAR pertained to boys only. CONCLUSIONS: Somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms differ in their association with both cardiac autonomic and HPA axis function in preadolescents. Particularly, somatic depression symptoms may mark cardiac risk.},

As such, recognising the potential links between stress-related psychological disorders and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is becoming increasingly important in cardiovascular epidemiology research. The primary aim of this study was to explore prospectively potential associations between clinically relevant depressive symptomatology and anxiety levels and the 10-year CVD incidence among apparently healthy Greek adults. Design A population-based, health and nutrition prospective survey. Methods In the context of the ATTICA Study (2002-2012), 853 adult participants without previous CVD history (453 men (45+/-13 years) and 400 women (44+/-18 years)) underwent psychological evaluations through validated, self-reporting depression and anxiety questionnaires. Results After adjustment for multiple established CVD risk factors, both reported depression and anxiety levels were positively and independently associated with the 10-year CVD incidence, with depression markedly increasing the CVD risk by approximately fourfold (adjusted odds ratio (95{\%} confidence interval) 3.6 (1.3, 11) for depression status; 1.03 (1.0, 1.1) for anxiety levels). Conclusions Our findings indicate that standardised psychological assessments focusing on depression and anxiety should be considered as an additional and distinct aspect in the context of CVD preventive strategies that are designed and implemented by health authorities at the general population level.},

abstract = {Objectives: Cardiac repolarization may be affected by psychiatric disorders and/or antidepressant use, but evidence for this is inconclusive. This study examined the relationship between depressive and anxiety disorder and use of antidepressants with T-wave amplitude (TWA) and QT-interval. Methods: Data was obtained from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (n = 1,383). Depression/anxiety was diagnosed with the DSM-IV based Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The use of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was established. T-wave amplitude and QT-interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) were obtained from an ECG measured in a type II axis configuration. Results: Compared to controls, persons with depression or anxiety disorders did not show a significantly different TWA (p = 0.58; Cohen's d = 0.046) or QTc (p = 0.48; Cohen's d = -0.057). In spite of known sympathomimetic effects, TCA use (p = 0.26; Cohen's d = -0.162) and SNRI use (p = 0.70; Cohen's d = -0.055) were not significantly associated with a lower TWA. TCA use (p = 0.12; Cohen's d = 0.225) and SNRI use (p = 0.11; Cohen's d = 0.227) were also not significantly associated with a prolonged QTc. Conclusion: We did not find evidence that either depressive/anxiety disorder or antidepressant use is associated with abnormalities in TWA or QTc. Earlier found sympathomimetic effects of TCAs and SNRIs are not evident in these measures of cardiac repolarization.},

Dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) may explain why depressed patients are at increased risk. Studies of medically well, depressed psychiatric patients have found elevated levels of plasma catecholamines and other markers of altered ANS function compared with controls. Studies of depressed patients with CHD have also uncovered evidence of ANS dysfunction, including elevated heart rate, low heart rate variability, exaggerated heart rate responses to physical stressors, high variability in ventricular repolarization, and low baroreceptor sensitivity. All of these indicators of ANS dysfunction have been associated with increased risks of mortality and cardiac morbidity in patients with CHD. Further research is needed to determine whether ANS dysfunction mediates the effects of depression on the course and outcome of CHD, and to develop clinical interventions that improve cardiovascular autonomic regulation while relieving depression in patients with CHD.},

abstract = {Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with coronary heart disease (CHD), but the mechanisms are unclear. The presence of MDD may increase CHD risk by affecting microvascular circulation. It is also plausible that genetic factors influencing MDD may overlap with those for CHD. We sought to examine the relationship between MDD and coronary flow reserve (CFR), the ratio of maximum flow during stress to flow at rest measured in milliliters per minute per gram of tissue. Methods We examined 289 male middle-aged twins, including 106 twins (53 twin pairs) discordant for a lifetime history of MDD and 183 control twins (unrelated to any twins in the experimental group) without MDD. To calculate CFR, we used positron emission tomography with nitrogen 13 (13N) ammonia to evaluate myocardial blood flow at rest and after adenosine stress. A standard perfusion defect score was also used to assess myocardial ischemia. Results There was no difference in myocardial ischemia between twins with and without MDD. Among the dizygotic twin pairs discordant for MDD, the CFR was 14{\%} lower in the twins with MDD than in their brothers without MDD (2.36 vs 2.74) (P = .03). This association was not present in the monozygotic discordant pairs who were genetically matched (2.86 vs 2.64) (P = .19). The zygosity-MDD interaction after adjustment was significant (P = .006). The CFR in the dizygotic twins with MDD was also lower than in the control twins. Conclusions Our results provide evidence for a shared genetic pathway between MDD and microvascular dysfunction. Common pathophysiologic processes may link MDD and early atherosclerosis.},

Yet, the direct association of HRV with cognitive function remains relatively unexplored, particularly in midlife. METHODS In 2005, 2 measures of short-term HRV, the SD of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), were calculated for participants of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study, and then categorized into quartiles. Five years later, 3 cognitive tests were administered for verbal memory ("Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test", RAVLT, range 0-15), processing speed ("Digit Symbol Substitution Test", DSST, range 0-133), and executive function ("Stroop interference"). RESULTS Two thousand one hundred and eighteen participants (57.7{\%} female, 42.2{\%} Black) with a mean baseline age of 45.3 years were included in this analysis. In demographic-adjusted models, compared to participants with quartile 1 SDNN (lowest quartile), participants in the upper quartiles of SDNN scored better on the DSST (quartile 4: $\beta$ = 1.83 points better, P = 0.03; and quartile 3: $\beta$ = 1.95 points better, P = 0.03) and on the stroop (quartile 3: $\beta$ = 1.19 points better, P {\textless} 0.05; and quartile2: $\beta$ = 1.44 points better, P = 0.02). After adjusting for behavioral and cardiovascular risk factors, higher quartile SDNN remained significantly associated with better stroop score (quartile 3: $\beta$ = 1.21 points better, P = 0.04; and quartile 2: $\beta$ = 1.72 points better, P {\textless} 0.01) but not with DSST. There was no association between quartile of RMSSD and cognitive function, from fully adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that higher quartile SDDN is associated with better executive function in midlife, above, and beyond cardiovascular risk factors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression is associated with an increased risk for mortality after acute myocardial infarction (MI). The purpose of this study was to determine whether low heart rate variability (HRV) mediates the effect of depression on mortality. METHODS: Twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were obtained from 311 depressed patients with a recent acute MI who were enrolled in the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease (ENRICHD) clinical trial and from 367 nondepressed patients who met the ENRICHD medical inclusion criteria. Standard HRV indexes were extracted from the recordings. RESULTS: The log of very low-frequency (LnVLF) power, an index of HRV derived from power spectral analysis of the electrocardiogram signal (0.0033-0.04 Hz [in milliseconds squared]), was lower in the depressed than in the nondepressed patients (P{\textless}.001). There were 47 deaths (6.1{\%}) during a 30-month follow-up. After adjusting for potential confounders, the depressed patients remained at higher risk for all-cause mortality compared with the nondepressed patients (hazard ratio, 2.8; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.4-5.4; P{\textless}.003). When LnVLF power was entered into the model, the hazard ratio for depression dropped to 2.1 (95{\%} CI, 1.1-4.2; P = .03). The proportion of the risk for depression attributable to LnVLF power was 0.27 (95{\%} CI, 0.23-0.31; P{\textless}.001). CONCLUSIONS: Low HRV partially mediates the effect of depression on survival after acute MI. This finding helps to clarify the physiological mechanisms underlying depression's role as a risk factor for mortality in patients with coronary heart disease. It also raises the possibility that treatments that improve both depression and HRV might also improve survival in these patients.},

However, the physiologic mechanisms by which these effects occur are not entirely clear. Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia occurs in a significant percentage of the CAD population. It is unknown if the proarrhythmic effects of psychological stress are mediated through the development of myocardial ischemia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of psychological stress on QT dispersion (QTd) among CAD patients and whether these effects are mediated via the development of myocardial ischemia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Psychological stress was induced using a public speaking task. Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) were recorded at rest, during mental stress, and during recovery. QTd was calculated as the difference between the longest and the shortest QT interval in the 12-lead ECG. Rest-stress myocardial perfusion imaging was also performed to detect mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Mental stress induced a significant increase in QTd compared to the resting condition (P {\textless} 0.001). This effect persisted beyond the first 10 minutes of recovery (P {\textless} 0.001). QTd was significantly associated with the development of mental stress ischemia with ischemic patients having significantly higher QTd during mental stress than nonischemic patients (P = 0.006). This finding remained significant after controlling for possible confounding factors (P = 0.01).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: An acute psychological stress induces a significant increase in QTd, which persists for more than 10 minutes after the cessation of the stressor. This effect seems to be, at least partially, mediated by the development of mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia.},

abstract = {Background: Somatic depressive symptoms and certain biomarkers are each associated with worse acute myocardial infarction (AMI) prognosis, but the relationship between depressive symptom domains and inflammatory, neurohormonal, and coagulation markers is unknown. Methods: We examined the relationship between depressive symptoms and 1-month biomarker levels (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP], N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP], white blood cell [WBC], platelet counts) in 1265 AMI patients. Depressive symptoms (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire) were assessed during index hospitalization and categorized as somatic or cognitive. Using median regression models, the upper quartile of somatic and cognitive depression scores and each biomarker were compared with the lower three quartiles, adjusting for site, demographics, and clinical characteristics. Results: Although hs-CRP values were higher in patients with somatic symptoms, this association was attenuated after adjustment (B per SD increase =.02, 95{\%} confidence interval:.00;.05, p =.07). WBC count was independently associated with somatic depressive symptoms (B per SD increase =.28, 95{\%} confidence interval:.12;.44, p {\textless}.001). Cognitive depressive symptoms were not associated with hs-CRP or WBC count. Neither dimension was associated with NT-proBNP or platelet levels. For each biomarker, the depression dimensions explained {\textless}1{\%} of their variation. Conclusions: Neither somatic nor cognitive depressive symptoms were meaningfully associated with hs-CRP, NT-proBNP, WBC, or platelet counts 1 month after AMI, suggesting that the association between depression and long-term outcomes may be unrelated to these biomarkers. Future research should explore other biomarkers to better illuminate pathways by which depression adversely impacts AMI prognosis. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {Rationale: Leucocyte telomere length (LTL) is a biological marker of aging, and shorter LTL is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Reduced regenerative capacity has been proposed as a mechanism. Bone marrow-derived circulating progenitor cells (PCs) are involved in tissue repair and regeneration. Objective: To examine the relationship between LTL and PCs, and their impact on adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Methods and Results: We measured LTL by quantitative PCR in 566 outpatients (age 63±9 years, 76{\%} male) with coronary artery disease (CAD). Circulating PCs were enumerated by flow cytometry. After adjustment for age, gender, race, BMI, smoking and previous myocardial infarction, a shorter LTL was associated with a lower CD34+ cell count: for each 10{\%} shorter LTL, CD34+ levels were 5.2{\%} lower (p{\textless}0.001). After adjustment for the aforementioned factors, both short LTL ({\textless}Q1) and low CD34+ levels ({\textless}Q1) predicted adverse cardiovascular outcomes (death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization or cerebrovascular events) independently of each other, with a hazards ratio (HR) of 1.8, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.1-2.0, and a HR of 2.1, 95{\%} CI, 1.3-3.0, respectively, comparing Q1 to Q2-4. Patients who had both short LTL ({\textless}Q1) and low CD34+ cell count ({\textless}Q1), had the greatest risk of adverse outcomes (HR=3.5, 95{\%} CI, 1.7-7.1). Conclusion: Although shorter LTL is associated with decreased regenerative capacity, both LTL and circulating PC levels are independent and additive predictors of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in CAD patients. Our results suggest that both biological aging and reduced regenerative capacity contribute to cardiovascular events, independent of conventional risk factors.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Autonomic dysfunction frequently occurs in the context of Parkinson disease (PD) and may precede onset of motor symptoms. Limited data exist on the prospective association of heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of autonomic function, with PD risk.$\backslash$nMETHODS: We included 12,162 participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, a community-based cohort, without a diagnosis of PD at baseline (1987-1989) and with available HRV data (mean age = 54 years, 57{\%} women). A 2-minute electrocardiogram was used to measure HRV. Incident PD was identified through 2008 from multiple sources, and adjudicated. Multivariable Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) of PD by quartiles of HRV measurements.$\backslash$nRESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 18 years, we identified 78 incident PD cases. Lower values of the root mean square of successive differences in normal-to-normal R-R intervals (rMSSD) and standard deviation of normal-to-normal R-R intervals (SDNN), markers of parasympathetic activity and total variability, respectively, were associated with higher PD risk during follow-up. In multivariate models, the HR (95{\%} CI) of PD in the bottom quartiles of rMSSD and SDNN compared to the top quartiles were 2.1 (1.0-4.3) and 2.9 (1.4-6.1), respectively. Other measures of cardiac autonomic function, including mean R-R interval and frequency-domain measurements, were not associated with PD risk.$\backslash$nINTERPRETATION: In this prospective cohort, decreased HRV was associated with an increased risk of PD. Assessment of cardiac autonomic function may help identify individuals at risk for PD.},

abstract = {We investigated cardiac autonomic function in 16 patients with panic disorder before and after treatment with paroxetine using Holter ECG records. Our previous data suggest a relative increase in sympathetic activity in patients with panic disorder, especially during sleep. Data for 20 h and awake and sleep periods were analyzed using spectral analysis to quantify absolute and relative heart period variability in ultra low (ULF: {\textless} 0.0033 Hz), very low (VLF: 0.0033-0.04 Hz), low (LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz) and high (HF: 0.15-0.5 Hz) frequency bands. We also obtained fractal dimensions (FD) for the 20-hour, awake and sleep time series of RR intervals. Paroxetine treatment (19.7 + 4.7 mg/day for 105 + 37 days) resulted in a significant improvement in the frequency and intensity of panic attacks and also on the state anxiety inventory. Paroxetine treatment produced a significant decrease of 20-hour absolute HF power, awake absolute LF power and sleep absolute HF power. There was also a significant decrease of FDs after treatment with paroxetine for the sleep period. The decrease in LF and HF powers, and sleep FD is likely due to the antimuscarinic effect of paroxetine. The decrease in day-time LF power may also be due to a decrease in relative cardiac sympathetic activity after paroxetine treatment.},

abstract = {Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been linked to increased morbidity. An inflexibility of the autonomic nervous system might be the underlying mechanism. We aimed to assess whether PTSD and combat trauma exposure are associated with lower heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function and a predictor of death. Methods: We measured HRV by power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram in 459 middle-aged veteran male twins. Combat trauma was assessed with the combat exposure scale, and current and remitted PTSD was assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders. Mixed-effects regression models were used to test associations of PTSD and HRV between and within twin pairs. Results: Of all twins, 211 had combat exposure, 31 had current PTSD, and 43 had remitted PTSD. Current PTSD was inversely associated with very-low-frequency and low-frequency HRV both in individual twins and within 20 pairs discordant for current PTSD. Twins with current PTSD had a 49{\%} lower low-frequency HRV than their brothers without PTSD (p{\textless}.001). Remitted PTSD was not associated with HRV. Results were robust to adjustment for depression and other risk factors. Combat exposure was inversely associated with most HRV frequencies, but this association mostly diminished after adjustment for current PTSD. Conclusion: In middle-aged veteran men, combat exposure and current PTSD are associated with measures of autonomic inflexibility previously shown to have prognostic significance. The negative health impact of combat exposure on autonomic function is mediated largely through PTSD and might reverse with remission of PTSD. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

We evaluated the autonomic response to stress reactivity of young healthy subjects and aging subjects with coronary artery disease to understand how the autonomic stress response differs with aging. Methods Physiologic reactivity to arithmetic stress in a cohort of 25 young, healthy subjects ({\textless} 30 years) and another cohort of 25 older subjects ({\textgreater} 55 years) with CAD was evaluated using electrocardiography, impedance cardiography, and arterial pressure recordings. Stress-related changes in the pre-ejection period (PEP), which measures sympathetic activity, and high frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV), which measures parasympathetic activity, were analyzed as primary outcomes. Results Mental stress reduced PEP in both groups (p{\textless}0.01), although the decrease was 50{\%} greater in the healthy group. Mean HF HRV decreased significantly in the aging group only (p = 0.01). Discussion PEP decreases with stress regardless of health and age status, implying increased sympathetic function. Its decline with stress may be attenuated in CAD. The HF HRV (parasympathetic) stress reactivity is more variable and attenuated in younger individuals; perhaps this is related to a protective parasympathetic reflex.

abstract = {Objective: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is a common phenomenon in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and an emerging prognostic factor. Mental stress ischemia is correlated with ambulatory ischemia. However, whether it is related to angina symptoms during daily life has not been examined. Methods: We assessed angina frequency (past month) in 98 post-myocardial infarction (MI) subjects (age 18-60years) using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. Patients underwent [99mTc]sestamibi SPECT perfusion imaging at rest, after mental stress, and after exercise/pharmacological stress. Summed scores of perfusion abnormalities were obtained by observer-independent software. A summed difference score (SDS), the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. Results: The mean age was 50. years, 50{\%} were female and 60{\%} were non-white. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, CAD severity, depressive, anger, and anxiety symptoms, each 1-point increase in mental stress-SDS was associated with 1.73-unit increase in the angina frequency score (95{\%} CI: 0.09-3.37) and 17{\%} higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.17, 95{\%} CI: 1.00-1.38). Depressive symptoms were associated with 12{\%} higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.12, 95{\%} CI: 1.03-1.21). In contrast, exercise/pharmacological stress-induced SDS was not associated with angina frequency. Conclusion: Among young and middle-aged post-MI patients, myocardial ischemia induced by mental stress in the lab, but not by exercise/pharmacological stress, is associated with higher frequency of retrospectively reported angina during the day. Psychosocial stressors related to mental stress ischemia may be important contributory factor to daily angina.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To investigate sex-specific vascular mechanisms for mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI). APPROACH AND RESULTS Baseline data from a prospective cohort study of 678 patients with coronary artery disease underwent myocardial perfusion imaging before and during a public speaking stressor. The rate-pressure product response was calculated as the difference between the maximum value during the speech minus the minimum value during rest. Peripheral vasoconstriction by peripheral arterial tonometry was calculated as the ratio of pulse wave amplitude during the speech over the resting baseline; ratios {\textless}1 indicate a vasoconstrictive response. MSIMI was defined as percent of left ventricle that was ischemic and as a dichotomous variable. Men (but not women) with MSIMI had a higher rate-pressure product response than those without MSIMI (6500 versus 4800 mm Hg bpm), whereas women (but not men) with MSIMI had a significantly lower peripheral arterial tonometry ratio than those without MSIMI (0.5 versus 0.8). In adjusted linear regression, each 1000-U increase in rate-pressure product response was associated with 0.32{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.22-0.42) increase in inducible ischemia among men, whereas each 0.10-U decrease in peripheral arterial tonometry ratio was associated with 0.23{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.11-0.35) increase in inducible myocardial ischemia among women. Results were independent of conventional stress-induced myocardial ischemia. CONCLUSIONS Women and men have distinct cardiovascular reactivity mechanisms for MSIMI. For women, stress-induced peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress, and not increased hemodynamic workload, is associated with MSIMI, whereas for men, it is the opposite. Future studies should examine these pathways on long-term outcomes.},

abstract = {Objective: The association between cardiovascular reactivity and major depressive disorder (MDD) remains unclear. This study aimed to examine this association via reactive heart rate variability (HRV) in a well-diagnosed first-episode MDD group and a control group. Methods: A total of 160 physically healthy, drug-naive patients presenting with their first-episode MDD and 50 healthy controls were recruited. All participants underwent a 5-min electrocardiography at rest and during a mental arithmetic task. Depression severity was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI). Results: HRV measures that showed between-group differences at rest did not reached significance during mental stress. In contrast, HRV measures that revealed between-group differences during stress did not reach significance at rest. In response to mental stress, HRV measures did not significantly change in both group. However, LF and HF in response to stress were different between groups. Patients with MDD revealed an increasing trend in HF and a decreasing trend in LF; conversely, healthy controls had a decreasing trend in HF and an increasing trend in LF. BDI scores correlated with changes in heart rate in the control group. Conclusions: The fundamental change to reactive HRV in patients with first-episode MDD appears qualitative, not quantitative. A distinctly reverse trend in reactive HRV measures were evident between these two groups. Moreover, patients with MDD showed entirely distinct changes in reactive HRV from those in resting HRV. We suggest that in patients with MDD, autonomic system shifts to sympathetic dominance at rest but toward parasympathetic dominance in response to stress. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Emerging data suggest that young women with coronary heart disease (CHD) are disproportionally vulnerable to the adverse cardiovascular effects of psychological stress. We hypothesized that younger, but not older, women with stable CHD are more likely than their male peers to develop mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI). METHODS AND RESULTS We studied 686 patients (191 women) with stable coronary heart disease (CHD). Patients underwent (99m)Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest and with both mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) stress testing. We compared quantitative (by automated software) and visual parameters of inducible ischemia between women and men and assessed age as an effect modifier. Women had a more-adverse psychosocial profile than men whereas there were few differences in medical history and CHD risk factors. Both quantitative and visual indicators of ischemia with mental stress were disproportionally larger in younger women. For each 10 years of decreasing age, the total reversibility severity score with mental stress was 9.6 incremental points higher (interaction, P{\textless}0.001) and the incidence of MSIMI was 82.6{\%} higher (interaction, P=0.004) in women than in men. Incidence of MSIMI in women ≤50 years was almost 4-fold higher than in men of similar age and older patients. These results persisted when adjusting for sociodemographic and medical risk factors, psychosocial factors, and medications. There were no significant sex differences in inducible ischemia with conventional stress. CONCLUSIONS Young women with stable CHD are susceptible to MSIMI, which could play a role in the prognosis of this group.},

abstract = {Early childhood trauma has been associated with increased risk for subsequent coronary heart disease (CHD), but little is known regarding what role genetic and shared familial factors play in this relationship. Early trauma was measured retrospectively in 562 male middle-aged twins with the Early Trauma Inventory. CHD was assessed by history and by myocardial perfusion imaging with positron emission tomography [(13)N] ammonia. Coronary flow reserve, a measure of coronary microcirculatory function, was defined as the ratio of myocardial blood flow at rest to flow during stress. Early trauma was associated with a higher prevalence of CHD by clinical history, OR = 1.48 per early trauma inventory quartile increase, 95{\%} CI [1.18, 1.86]. When within- and between-pair effects were estimated, only the between-pair association was significant, OR = 1.76, 95{\%} CI [1.30, 2.40], showing that the odds of CHD in the twin pair increased as the average early trauma exposure in the pair increased. A marginal between-pair (but not within-pair) relationship was also found between early trauma and coronary flow reserve (n = 416, unstandardized B = -0.04, SE B = 0.02, p = .036). In conclusion, early trauma was associated with CHD and familial factors played a key role.},

In 440 middle-aged men and women, resting HF-HRV was related to regional CBF derived from a resting arterial spin-labeled MRI scan and to seven neuropsychological tests of executive function.

abstract = {The current study was designed to evaluate the effects of a disrupted social environment on the endothelial integrity of various vascular segments in male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Each of 20 single-caged adult monkeys was fed a diet comparable to a person's ingestion of 240 mg cholesterol/day for a 10-week baseline period and then was introduced as a stranger into a four-member social group for 3 days. Half of the monkeys received a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (metoprolol) via subcutaneous implant 2 days before and during group housing. The social manipulation produced persistent sympathetic arousal as evidenced by significantly elevated heart rates among untreated monkeys (p less than 0.01) but not among their metoprolol-treated counterparts, whose heart rate declined (p less than 0.05). After the social manipulation, all monkeys were necropsied and evaluated for endothelial incorporation of immunoglobulin G (as an indicator of cell death), endothelial cell replication, the presence of adherent leukocytes, and arterial low density lipoprotein permeability and concentration. At branching sites in the thoracic aorta, immunoglobulin G incorporation and endothelial cell replication were significantly greater in untreated monkeys than in metoprolol-treated monkeys (p less than 0.01 for both analyses); no differences existed at nonbranch sites. Endothelial cell replication in the coronary arteries (where immunoglobulin G incorporation was not examined) was also greater among untreated than among metoprolol-treated monkeys. No significant differences were observed between treatment groups in arterial low density lipoprotein permeability or leukocyte adherence; estimates of arterial low density lipoprotein concentrations were higher among untreated than among metoprolol-treated monkeys, but only in the abdominal portion of the aorta. These results indicate that social disruption is associated with both sympathetic nervous system arousal and indexes of endothelial dysfunction, effects that may be prevented by treatment with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent.},

The harmful consequences of poor social support and the protective effects of good social support in mental illness have been well documented.

abstract = {Background: Depression is associated with an increased risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation, proinflammatory processes, and procoagulant processes have been suggested as possible explanations. Methods: Heart rate variability (HRV), an indicator of cardiac autonomic regulation, and markers of inflammation [C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$)] and coagulation (fibrinogen) were assessed in 44 depressed patients with CHD. Results: Moderate, negative correlations were found between fibrinogen and four measures of HRV. IL-6 also negatively correlated with one measure of HRV (total power) and was marginally related to two others (very low frequency and low frequency power). Neither CRP nor TNF-$\alpha$ was significantly related to any measure of HRV. Conclusions: The finding that fibrinogen and IL-6 are moderately related to HRV suggests a link between these factors in depressed CHD patients. The relationship between ANS function and inflammatory and coagulant processes should be investigated in larger mechanistic studies of depression and cardiac morbidity and mortality. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In the present paper we present the outlines of a model that integrates autonomic, attentional, and affective systems into a functional and structural network that may help to guide us in our understanding of emotion regulation and dysregulation. We will emphasize the relationship between attentional regulation and affective processes and propose a group of underlying physiological systems that serve to integrate these functions in the service of self-regulation and adaptability of the organism. We will attempt to place this network in the context of dynamical systems models which involve feedback and feedforward circuits with special attention to negative feedback mechanisms, inhibitory processes, and their role in response selection. From a systems perspective, inhibitory processes can be viewed as negative feedback circuits that allow for the interruption of ongoing behavior and the re-deployment of resources to other tasks. When these negative feedback mechanisms are compromised, positive feedback loops may develop as a result (of dis-inhibition). From this perspective, the relative sympathetic activation seen in anxiety disorders may represent dis-inhibition due to faulty inhibitory mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {How do adverse childhood experiences get 'under the skin' and influence health outcomes through the life-course? Research reviewed here suggests that adverse childhood experiences are associated with changes in biological systems responsible for maintaining physiological stability through environmental changes, or allostasis. Children exposed to maltreatment showed smaller volume of the prefrontal cortex, greater activation of the HPA axis, and elevation in inflammation levels compared to non-maltreated children. Adults with a history of childhood maltreatment showed smaller volume of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, greater activation of the HPA axis, and elevation in inflammation levels compared to non-maltreated individuals. Despite the clear limitations in making longitudinal claims from cross-sectional studies, work so far suggests that adverse childhood experiences are associated with enduring changes in the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems. These changes are already observable in childhood years and remain apparent in adult life. Adverse childhood experiences induce significant biological changes in children (biological embedding), modifying the maturation and the operating balance of allostatic systems. Their chronic activation can lead to progressive wear and tear, or allostatic load and overload, and, thus, can exert long-term effects on biological aging and health. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Major depressive disorder (MDD) occurs in 15{\%} to 23{\%} of patients with acute coronary syndromes and constitutes an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality. However, no published evidence exists that antidepressant drugs are safe or efficacious in patients with unstable ischemic heart disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of sertraline treatment of MDD in patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina and free of other life-threatening medical conditions. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 40 outpatient cardiology centers and psychiatry clinics in the United States, Europe, Canada, and Australia. Enrollment began in April 1997 and follow-up ended in April 2001. PATIENTS: A total of 369 patients with MDD (64{\%} male; mean age, 57.1 years; mean 17-item Hamilton Depression [HAM-D] score, 19.6; MI, 74{\%}; unstable angina, 26{\%}). INTERVENTION: After a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in, patients were randomly assigned to receive sertraline in flexible dosages of 50 to 200 mg/d (n = 186) or placebo (n = 183) for 24 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary (safety) outcome measure was change from baseline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); secondary measures included surrogate cardiac measures and cardiovascular adverse events, as well as scores on the HAM-D scale and Clinical Global Impression Improvement scale (CGI-I) in the total randomized sample, in a group with any prior history of MDD, and in a more severe MDD subgroup defined a priori by a HAM-D score of at least 18 and history of 2 or more prior episodes of MDD. RESULTS: Sertraline had no significant effect on mean (SD) LVEF (sertraline: baseline, 54{\%} [10{\%}]; week 16, 54{\%} [11{\%}]; placebo: baseline, 52{\%} [13{\%}]; week 16, 53{\%} [13{\%}]), treatment-emergent increase in ventricular premature complex (VPC) runs (sertraline: 13.1{\%}; placebo: 12.9{\%}), QTc interval greater than 450 milliseconds at end point (sertraline: 12{\%}; placebo: 13{\%}), or other cardiac measures. All comparisons were statistically nonsignificant (P{\textgreater} or = .05). The incidence of severe cardiovascular adverse events was 14.5{\%} with sertraline and 22.4{\%} with placebo. In the total randomized sample, the CGI-I (P =.049), but not the HAM-D (P =.14), favored sertraline. The CGI-I responder rates for sertraline were significantly higher than for placebo in the total sample (67{\%} vs 53{\%}; P =.01), in the group with at least 1 prior episode {\ldots}},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of cardiovascular changes (i.e., QT interval, QT dispersion (QTD), heart rate variability (HRV), and other cardiovascular measures) in subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). DESIGN: Each subject underwent clinical and cognitive examination, a structural brain imaging study, echocardioDoppler, electrocardiogram (ECG), HRV analysis using 24-hour ECG monitoring, and 24-hour blood pressure monitoring. SETTING: Community population-based sample of patients admitted to an AD center for investigation of cognitive disturbances. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-three subjects with AD, 39 subjects with MCI, and 29 cognitive healthy subjects (controls) matched for demographic characteristics, hypertensive condition, smoking habits, and laboratory parameters were enrolled consecutively. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical and cognitive examination, structural brain imaging study, echocardioDoppler, ECG, HRV analysis using 24-hour ECG monitoring, and 24-hour blood pressure monitoring. RESULTS: QTD and QT corrected dispersion mean values were significantly higher in patients with AD than in patients with MCI and controls and higher in patients with MCI than in controls. HRV time and domain parameters were lower in patients with AD than in patients with MCI and controls. No difference in other cardiovascular measures was found. QTD and HRV were found to be significantly correlated with the degree of cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: These findings support the presence of a peculiar neuroanatomic dysfunction in patients with AD and MCI that parallels the disease progression. These noninvasive parameters might prove to be powerful predictive tools in the worsening of cognitive function and mortality risk.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is set to become a major health problem with the exponential ageing of the world's population. The association between MCI and autonomic dysfunction, supported by indirect evidence and rich with clinical implications in terms of progression to dementia and increased risk of mortality and falls, has never been specifically demonstrated. AIM To conduct a comprehensive assessment of autonomic function in subjects with MCI by means of power spectral analysis (PSA) of heart rate variability (HRV) at rest and during provocative manoeuvres. METHODS This cross-sectional study involved 80 older outpatients (aged ≥ 65) consecutively referred to a geriatric unit and diagnosed with MCI or normal cognition (controls) based on neuropsychological testing. PSA was performed on 5-minute electrocardiographic recordings under three conditions--supine rest with free breathing (baseline), supine rest with paced breathing at 12 breaths/minute (parasympathetic stimulation), and active standing (orthosympathetic stimulation)--with particular focus on the changes from baseline to stimulation of indices of sympathovagal balance: normalized low frequency (LFn) and high frequency (HFn) powers and the LF/HF ratio. Blood pressure (BP) was measured at baseline and during standing. Given its exploratory nature in a clinical population the study included subjects on medications with a potential to affect HRV. RESULTS There were no significant differences in HRV indices between the two groups at baseline. MCI subjects exhibited smaller physiological changes in all three HRV indices during active standing, consistently with a dysfunction of the orthosympathetic system. Systolic BP after 10 minutes of standing was lower in MCI subjects, suggesting dysautonomia-related orthostatic BP dysregulation. CONCLUSIONS Our study is novel in providing evidence of autonomic dysfunction in MCI. This is associated with orthostatic BP dysregulation and the ongoing follow-up of the study population will determine its prognostic relevance as a predictor of adverse health outcomes.},

No previous study has assessed neighborhood poverty with hemodynamic, neuroendocrine, and immune reactivity to stress. We used data from 632 patients with coronary artery disease. Patients' residential addresses were geocoded and merged with poverty data from the 2010 American Community Survey at the census-tract level. A z-transformation was calculated to classify census tracts (neighborhoods) as either having 'high' or 'low' poverty. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, rate-pressure product, epinephrine, interleukin-6, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were measured before and after a public speaking stress task. Multilevel models were used for repeated measures and accounting for individuals nested within census tracts. Adjusted models included demographics, lifestyle and medical risk factors, and medication use. Another set of models included propensity scores weighted by the inverse probability of neighborhood status for sex, age, race, and individual-level income. The mean age was 63 years and 173 were women. After adjusting for potential confounders, participants living in high (vs. low) poverty neighborhoods had similar hemodynamic values at rest and lower values during mental stress for systolic blood pressure (157 mmHg vs. 161 mmHg; p = 0.07), heart rate (75 beats/min vs. 78 beats/min; p = 0.02) and rate-pressure product (11839 mmHg x beat/min vs 12579 mmHg x beat/min; p = 0.01). P-values for neighborhood poverty-by-time interactions were {\textless}0.05. Results were similar in the propensity weighted models. There were no significant differences in inflammatory and epinephrine responses to mental stress based on neighborhood poverty status. A blunted hemodynamic response to mental stress was observed among participants living in high poverty neighborhoods. Future studies should explore whether neighborhood poverty and blunted hemodynamic response to stress translate into differences in long-term cardiovascular outcomes.},

abstract = {Epidemiologic studies have linked exposure to severe environment stress, such as natural disasters and combat operations, to the onset of specific psychiatric disorders. Some research also suggests that these exposures may be associated with the onset of chronic diseases as well. However, these chronic disease outcome studies often have been obscured by bias and confounding. The medical histories of 1,399 male Vietnam veterans approximately 20 years after combat exposure were analyzed by lifetime posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) status (lifetime PTSD = 332 cases). These Ss were included in a national, random in-person study of United States Army veterans of the Vietnam War. After controlling for preservice, in-service, and postservice factors (including intelligence, race, region of birth, enlistment status, volunteer status, Army marital status, Army medical profile, hypochondriasis, age, smoking history, substance abuse, education, and income), associations were found for reported circulatory, digestive, musculoskeletal, endocrine-nutritional-metabolic, nervous system, respiratory, and nonsexually transmitted infectious disease after military service.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies have found that depression is an independent predictor of poor outcome after the onset of clinical coronary artery disease. There are few data concerning depression as a risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine if clinical depression is an independent risk factor for incident coronary artery disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Johns Hopkins Precursors Study is a prospective, observational study of 1190 male medical students who were enrolled between 1948 and 1964 and who continued to be followed up. In medical school and through the follow-up period, information was collected on family history, health behaviors, and clinical depression. Cardiovascular disease end points have been assessed with reviews of annual questionnaires, National Death Index searches, medical records, death certificates, and autopsy reports. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of clinical depression in the medical students at 40 years of follow-up was 12{\%}. Men who developed clinical depression drank more coffee than those who did not but did not differ in terms of baseline blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, smoking status, physical activity, obesity, or family history of coronary artery disease. In multivariate analysis, the men who reported clinical depression were at significantly greater risk for subsequent coronary heart disease (relative risk [RR], 2.12; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.24-3.63) and myocardial infarction (RR, 2.12; 95{\%} CI, 1.11-4.06). The increased risk associated with clinical depression was present even for myocardial infarctions occurring 10 years after the onset of the first depressive episode (RR, 2.1; 95{\%} CI, 1.1-4.0). CONCLUSION: Clinical depression appears to be an independent risk factor for incident coronary artery disease for several decades after the onset of the clinical depression.},

The systematic review included nine independent case-crossover studies of anger outbursts and MI/ACS (four studies), ischaemic stroke (two studies), ruptured intracranial aneurysm (one study), and ventricular arrhythmia (two studies). There was evidence of substantial heterogeneity between the studies (I(2) = 92.5{\%} for MI/ACS and 89.8{\%} for ischaemic stroke).

abstract = {Background-Among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), depression is both common and underrecognized. The association of different manifestations of depression, somatic and cognitive, with depression recognition and long-term prognosis is poorly understood. Methods and Results-Depression was confirmed in 481 AMI patients enrolled from 21 sites during their index hospitalization with a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score ≥10. Within the PHQ-9, separate somatic and cognitive symptom scores were derived, and the independent association between these domains and the clinical recognition of depression, as documented in the medical records, was evaluated. In a separate multisite AMI registry of 2347 patients, the association between somatic and cognitive depressive symptoms and 4-year all-cause mortality and 1-year all-cause rehospitalization was evaluated. Depression was clinically recognized in 29{\%} (n=140) of patients. Cognitive depressive symptoms (relative risk per SD increase, 1.14; 95{\%} CI, 1.03 to 1.26; P≥0.01) were independently associated with depression recognition, whereas the association for somatic symptoms and recognition (relative risk, 1.04; 95{\%} CI, 0.87 to 1.26; P=0.66) was not significant. However, unadjusted Cox regression analyses found that only somatic depressive symptoms were associated with 4-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR] per SD increase, 1.22; 95{\%} CI, 1.08 to 1.39) or 1-year rehospitalization (HR, 1.22; 95{\%} CI, 1.11 to 1.33), whereas cognitive manifestations were not (HR for mortality, 1.01; 95{\%} CI, 0.89 to 1.14; HR for rehospitalization, 1.01; 95{\%} CI, 0.93 to 1.11). After multivariable adjustment, the association between somatic symptoms and rehospitalization persisted (HR, 1.16; 95{\%} CI, 1.06 to 1.27; P=0.01) but was attenuated for mortality (HR, 1.07; 95{\%} CI, 0.94 to 1.21; P=0.30). Conclusions-Depression after AMI was recognized in fewer than 1 in 3 patients. Although cognitive symptoms were associated with recognition of depression, somatic symptoms were associa ed with long-term outcomes. Comprehensive screening and treatment of both somatic and cognitive symptoms may be necessary to optimize depression recognition and treatment in AMI patients.

abstract = {AIMS Heart failure (HF) is associated with tissue hypoperfusion and congestion leading to organ dysfunction. Although cerebral blood flow (CBF) is preserved over a wide range of perfusion pressures in healthy subjects, it is impaired in end-stage HF. We aimed to compare CBF, autoregulation, and cognitive function in patients with mild non-ischaemic HF with healthy controls. METHODS AND RESULTS Fifteen patients with mild idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and 15 matched healthy controls were studied. Co-existing cerebrovascular disease was excluded. All subjects, except five patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, underwent magnetic resonance imaging for measurements of both CBF by arterial spin labelling and quantitative volume flow entering the brain. Cardiocerebral vascular function was assessed with Doppler techniques testing cerebral dynamic autoregulation and vasomotor reactivity. Cognitive analysis was performed by neuropsychological testing. Global and regional CBF did not differ between HF patients (44.3 mL/100 g.min) and controls (42.1 mL/100 g.min). Basilar but not carotid artery inflow was reduced in patients (1.95 mL/s vs. 2.51 mL/s, P = 0.009). Testing autoregulation revealed fewer dampened blood flow fluctuations in HF patients vs. controls (0.96{\%} vs. 0.67{\%}, P {\textless} 0.001). Vasomotor reactivity in HF patients showed a reduced CBF velocity (48.4{\%} vs. 61.0{\%}, P = 0.05) and regional cerebral oxygen saturation (18.3{\%} vs. 23.8{\%}, P = 0.02). Cognitive function overall was not affected. CONCLUSION Although global CBF was unaffected in patients with mild HF, significant changes in basilar inflow volume, cerebral autoregulation and vasomotor reactivity were observed. We describe a model of dynamic cerebral mechanisms required to compensate for the impaired haemodynamics in early-stage HF.},

abstract = {Psychological depression is shown to be associated with several aspects of coronary artery disease (CAD), including arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, heart failure and sudden death. The physiological mechanisms accounting for this association are unclear. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal dysregulation, diminished heart rate variability, altered blood platelet function and noncompliance with medial treatments have been proposed as mechanisms underlying depression and cardiovascular disease. Recent evidence also suggests that reduced baroreflex sensitivity, impaired immune function, chronic fatigue and the co-morbidity of depression and anxiety may be involved in the relationship between depression and cardiovascular dysregulation. An experimental strategy using animal models for investigating underlying physiological abnormalities in depression is presented. A key to understanding the bidirectional association between depression and heart disease is to determine whether there are common changes in brain systems that are associated with these conditions. Such approaches may hold promise for advancing our understanding of the interaction between this mood disorder and CAD. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: Studies investigating inflammatory markers in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have yielded mixed results. The aim of our study was to compare concentrations of inflammatory markers in patients with PTSD compared with healthy controls. Methods: We did a meta-analysis and meta-regression of studies comparing inflammatory markers between patients with PTSD and healthy controls by searching PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO for articles published between Jan 1, 1960, and April 7, 2015. From eligible studies (ie, cross-sectional studies or baseline data from longitudinal studies of peripheral blood cytokine concentrations that compared adults with PTSD with healthy controls), we extracted outcomes of interest, such as mean and SD of peripheral blood cytokines, the time of day blood was collected, whether the study allowed patients with comorbid major depressive disorder in the PTSD group, whether patients were medication free, and severity of PTSD symptoms. We undertook meta-analyses whenever values of inflammatory markers were available in two or more studies. A random-effects model with restricted maximum-likelihood estimator was used to synthesise the effect size (assessed by standardised mean difference [SMD]) across studies. Findings: 8057 abstracts were identified and 20 studies were included. Interleukin 6 (SMD 0.88; p=0.0003), interleukin 1$\beta$ (SMD 1.42; p=0.045), and interferon $\gamma$ (SMD 0.49; p=0.002) levels were higher in the PTSD group than in healthy controls. Subgroup meta-analysis of patients who were not given medication showed higher tumour necrosis factor $\alpha$ (TNF$\alpha$ SMD 0.69, 95{\%} CI 0.35-1.02; p{\textless}0.0001) in the PTSD group than the control group in addition to the aforementioned cytokines. TNF$\alpha$ (SMD 1.32, 0.13-2.50; p=0.003), interleukin 1$\beta$ (SMD 2.35, 0.01-4.68; p=0.048), and interleukin 6 (SMD 1.75, 0.97-2.53; p{\textless}0.0001) levels remained increased in the PTSD group in a subgroup meta-analysis of studies that excluded comorbid major depressive disorder. Illness duration was positively associated with interleukin 1$\beta$ levels (b=0.33, p{\textless}0.0001) and severity with interleukin 6 (b=0.02, p=0.042). A model composed of several variables-presence of comorbid major depressive disorder, use of psychotropic medications, assay used, and time of day blood was collected-explained the large amount of heterogeneity between interleukin 1$\beta$, interleukin 6, and C-reactive protein studies. Egger's linear regression test revealed a potential publication bias for interleukin 1$\beta$. Additionally, for most inflammatory markers, study heterogeneity was reported to be high (I2{\textgreater}75{\%}). Interpretation: PTSD is associated with increased interleukin 6, interleukin 1$\beta$, TNF$\alpha$, and interferon $\gamma$ levels. This information might be useful for consideration of chronic low-grade inflammation as a potential target or biomarker in PTSD treatment. Use of psychotropic medication and presence of comorbid major depressive disorder were important moderators that might explain the inconsistency between results of previous studies. Our search strategy used a range of databases and we made exhaustive effort to acquire data by contacting the authors. Notably, high levels of between-study heterogeneity were recorded for most cytokine variables measured in our analysis. However, meta-regression analysis could explain a large amount of this heterogeneity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Coronary microvascular dysfunction may contribute to myocardial ischemia during mental stress (MS). However, the role of coronary epicardial and microvascular function in regulating coronary blood flow (CBF) responses during MS remains understudied. We hypothesized that coronary vasomotion during MS is dependent on the coronary microvascular endothelial function and will be reflected in the peripheral microvascular circulation. METHODS AND RESULTS In 38 patients aged 59±8 years undergoing coronary angiography, endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent coronary epicardial and microvascular responses were measured using intracoronary acetylcholine and nitroprusside, respectively, and after MS induced by mental arithmetic testing. Peripheral microvascular tone during MS was measured using peripheral arterial tonometry (Itamar Inc, Caesarea, Israel) as the ratio of digital pulse wave amplitude compared to rest (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio). MS increased the rate-pressure product by 22{\%} (±23{\%}) and constricted epicardial coronary arteries by -5.9{\%} (-10.5{\%}, -2.6{\%}) (median [interquartile range]), P=0.001, without changing CBF. Acetylcholine increased CBF by 38.5{\%} (8.1{\%}, 91.3{\%}), P=0.001, without epicardial coronary diameter change (0.1{\%} [-10.9{\%}, 8.2{\%}], P=not significant). The MS-induced CBF response correlated with endothelium-dependent CBF changes with acetylcholine (r=0.38, P=0.03) but not with the response to nitroprusside. The peripheral arterial tonometry ratio also correlated with the demand-adjusted change in CBF during MS (r=-0.60, P=0.004), indicating similarity between the microcirculatory responses to MS in the coronary and peripheral microcirculation. CONCLUSIONS The coronary microvascular response to MS is determined by endothelium-dependent, but not endothelium-independent, coronary microvascular function. Moreover, the coronary microvascular responses to MS are reflected in the peripheral microvascular circulation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Depression among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is prevalent and associated with an adverse quality of life and prognosis. Despite recommendations from some national organizations to screen for depression, it is unclear whether treatment of depression in patients with AMI is associated with better outcomes. We aimed to determine whether the prognosis of patients with treated versus untreated depression differs. METHODS The TRIUMPH study (Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients' Health Status) is an observational multicenter cohort study that enrolled 4062 patients aged ≥18 years with AMI between April 11, 2005, and December 31, 2008, from 24 US hospitals. Research coordinators administered the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) during the index AMI admission. Depression was defined by a PHQ-9 score of ≥10. Depression was categorized as treated if there was documentation of a discharge diagnosis, medication prescribed for depression, or referral for counseling, and as untreated if none of these 3 criteria was documented in the medical records despite a PHQ score ≥10. One-year mortality was compared between patients with AMI having: (1) no depression (PHQ-9{\textless}10; reference); (2) treated depression; and (3) untreated depression adjusting for demographics, AMI severity, and clinical factors. RESULTS Overall, 759 (18.7{\%}) patients met PHQ-9 criteria for depression and 231 (30.4{\%}) were treated. In comparison with 3303 patients without depression, the 231 patients with treated depression had 1-year mortality rates that were not different (6.1{\%} versus 6.7{\%}; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.12; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.63-1.99). In contrast, the 528 patients with untreated depression had higher 1-year mortality in comparison with patients without depression (10.8{\%} versus 6.1{\%}; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.91; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.39-2.62). CONCLUSIONS Although depression in patients with AMI is associated with increased long-term mortality, this association may be confined to patients with untreated depression.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Clinical depression is a risk factor for cardiac mortality in patients with coronary heart disease. High QT interval variability is a risk factor for arrhythmic events, including sudden cardiac death. The purpose of this study was to determine whether depression is associated with increased QT variability in patients recovering from myocardial infarction. METHODS: Twenty patients with major depression recovering from a recent myocardial infarction were matched with 20 nondepressed post-myocardial infarction patients on age and sex, and all underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring. RESULTS: There were no differences between groups on average heart rate, heart rate variability, or other electrocardiographic measures. However, the QT interval showed significantly greater variability in the depressed than in the nondepressed group, especially at midnight and at 6:00 AM. CONCLUSIONS: Depressed post-myocardial infarction patients may be at greater risk for sudden cardiac death as a result of abnormalities in ventricular repolarization. More work is needed to determine the clinical and prognostic significance of QT variability in these patients.},

abstract = {Objective Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and despite important advances in our understanding of this disorder, the underlying mechanisms remain under investigation. Recently, increased attention has been placed on the role of behavioral factors such as emotional stress on CAD risk. Brain areas involved in memory and the stress response, including medial prefrontal cortex, insula, and parietal cortex, also have outputs to the peripheral cardiovascular system. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of mental stress on brain and cardiac function in patients with CAD. Methods CAD patients (N = 170) underwent cardiac imaging with [Tc-99m] sestamibi single-photon emission tomography at rest and during a public speaking mental stress task. On another day, they underwent imaging of the brain with [O-15] water positron emission tomography (PET) during mental stress (arithmetic and public speaking) and control conditions. Results Patients with mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia showed increased activation with stress in anterior cingulate, inferior frontal gyrus, and parietal cortex (p {\textless}.005). This was seen with both arithmetic stress and public speaking stress. Arithmetic stress was additionally associated with left insula activation, and public speaking with right pre/postcentral gyrus and middle temporal gyrus activation (p {\textless}.005). Conclusions These findings suggest that mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is associated with activation in brain areas involved in the stress response and autonomic regulation of the cardiovascular system. Altered brain reactivity to stress could possibly represent a mechanism through which stress leads to increased risk of CAD-related morbidity and mortality.},

abstract = {The amount of time between heartbeats is controlled by the rate of depolarization of the sinoatrial node. This rate is controlled by a combination of sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs. For this reason, analysis of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) derived from intervals between normal heart beats provides insights into changing cardiac autonomic function. Increased sympathetic control of the heart from one time point to the next tends to increase HRs, decrease the amount of vagally modulated sinus arrhythmia measured as high-frequency (HF) spectral power, and increase the ratio between low-frequency (LF) spectral power and HF (the LF/HF ratio). Conversely, a shift toward greater vagal control of the heart tends to produce decreased HRs, increases in HF power, and decreases the LF/HF ratio. Clear circadian cycles of HR and HRV are seen in most subjects and correspond to periods of sleep and activity. The magnitude of these cycles is well captured by traditional HRV indices such as deviation of all normal-to-normal (NN) intervals. Cosinor analysis also provides a rough estimate of the magnitude of circadian rhythms. We have observed that HR and HRV fluctuate over time in a cyclic manner in most subjects. Although these cycles are especially prominent during the nighttime, they are seen in the daytime as well. We have developed a number of measures that quantify ultradian properties of HR/HRV cycles and would permit comparisons between subjects. We applied these measures during overnight polysomnography and have shown that ultradian rhythms of cardiac autonomic modulation have a variable and often weak correspondence with traditional sleep stages . In the current study, we applied the methodology developed for the nighttime recordings to 24-h recordings in young healthy subjects and compared these results to those obtained during the nighttime only in the same subjects and in an older group of cardiac patients. Our purpose was to explore the presenc- e and magnitude of ultradian cycles of HRV during the entire 24-h period and during sleep.},

abstract = {KEY POINTS: The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is critical for adaptation to environment demands. Alzheimer's disease (AD), via frontal compensatory processes, may affect PNS regulation, thereby compromising older adults' capacity for adaptation, and increasing morbidity and mortality risk. Here we found that AD-associated neurodegeneration accompanied an overactive anterior cingulate cortex, which in turn resulted in a high level of PNS activity at rest, as well as strong PNS activity withdrawal in response to the mental effort. This discovery provides the first line of evidence to suggest that AD-associated neurodegeneration links to altered PNS regulation during mental effort in older adults, and that the compensatory processes accompanying frontal hyperactivation appear to be responsible for these alterations. ABSTRACT: The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is critical for adaptation to environment demands. PNS can reflect an individual's regulatory capacity of frontal brain regions and has been linked to cognitive capacity. Yet, the relationship of PNS function to cognitive decline and abnormal frontal function that characterize preclinical progression toward Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unclear. Here, we aimed to elucidate the relationship between PNS function and AD-associated neurodegeneration by testing two competing hypotheses involving frontal regions' activity (neurodegeneration vs. compensation). In 38 older human adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or normative cognition, we measured AD-associated neurodegeneration (AD signature cortical thickness; ADSCT), resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging of frontal regions' spontaneous activation, and an electrocardiography measure of PNS (high frequency heart rate variability; HF-HRV). HF-HRV was assessed at rest and during a cognitive task protocol designed to capture HF-HRV reactivity. Higher HF-HRV at rest was significantly related to both more severe AD-associated neurodegeneration (lower ADSCT scores) and worse cognitive ability. Cognitive impairments were also related to greater suppression of HF-HRV reactivity. High activities of the anterior cingulate cortex significantly mediated relationships between ADSCT and both HF-HRV at rest and HF-HRV reactivity. Notably, these relationships were not affected by the clinical phenotype. We show that AD-associated neurodegeneration is associated with altered PNS regulation and that compensatory processes linked to frontal overactivation might be responsible for those alterations. This finding provides the first line of evidence in a new framework for understanding how early-stage AD-associated neurodegeneration affects autonomic regulation.},

abstract = {Background: The mechanisms by which psychological factors may influence possibly arrhythmia risk are not known. We hypothesized that psychological wellness, measured by the General Well-Being Schedule (GBWS), is associated with less repolarization heterogeneity as measured by T-axis. We also explored whether T-axis was a mediator in the relationship of GWBS with adverse cardiac outcomes. Methods: We studied 5533 adults aged 25–74 years without a history of CVD from NHANES I (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) (1971–75). Frontal T-axis was obtained through 12-lead ECG and characterized as normal (15° to 75°), borderline (−15° to 15° or 75° to 105°) or abnormal ({\textgreater}105° or {\textless}−15°). Results: The mean ± SD age was 43.1 ± 11.5 years and 55{\%} were women. A 1-SD increase in GWBS score associated with a 23{\%} reduced odds of abnormal T-axis (p {\textless} 0.001) and 11{\%} lower hazard of composite CHD hospitalization and death (p = 0.02). When adjusting for sociodemographic factors, health behaviors, and CHD risk factors, the association was minimally changed and remained statistically significant. Additional adjustment for T-axis did not change the relationship with outcomes. Conclusion: General well-being is independently associated with less abnormal frontal T-axis and CHD events in otherwise healthy individuals.},
