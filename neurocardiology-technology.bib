abstract = {We address both technical and clinical issues of wearable biosensors (WBS). First, design concepts of a WBS are presented, with emphasis on the ring sensor developed by the author's group at MIT. The ring sensor is an ambulatory, telemetric, continuous health-monitoring device. This WBS combines miniaturized data acquisition features with advanced photoplethysmographic (PPG) techniques to acquire data related to the patient's cardiovascular state using a method that is far superior to existing fingertip PPG sensors. In particular, the ring sensor is capable of reliably monitoring a patient's heart rate, oxygen saturation, and heart rate variability. Technical issues, including motion artifact, interference with blood circulation, and battery power issues, are addressed, and effective engineering solutions to alleviate these problems are presented. Second, based on the ring sensor technology the clinical potentials of WBS monitoring are addressed.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) is associated with positive physiological and psychological effects. HRV is affected by breathing parameters, yet debate remains regarding the best breathing interventions for strengthening HRV. The objective of the current study was to test whether the inclusion of a postexhalation rest period was effective at increasing HRV, while controlling for breathing rate. A within-subject crossover design was used with 40 participants who were assigned randomly to a breathing pattern including a postexhalation rest period or a breathing pattern that omitted the postexhalation rest period. Participants completed training on each breathing pattern, practiced for 6 min, and sat quietly during a 5-min washout period between practices. Participants were given instructions for diaphragmatic breathing at a pace of six breaths/minute with or without a postexhalation rest period. Recordings of heart rate, breathing rate, HF-HRV, RMSSD, LF-HRV, and SDNN were collected before and during each of the breathing trials. HRV indices were derived from Lead 1 ECG recordings. Pairwise contrasts showed that inclusion of a postexhalation rest period significantly decreased heart rate (p {\textless} .001) and increased HF-HRV (p {\textless} .05). No differences were found for breathing rates (p {\textgreater} .05), RMSSD (p {\textgreater} .05), and SDNN (p {\textgreater} .05). Results indicated that omission of the postexhalation rest period resulted in higher LF-HRV (p {\textless} .05). A postexhalation rest period improves HF-HRV, commonly associated with self-regulatory control, yet the importance of a postexhalation rest period requires further exploration.},

Previous studies demonstrated potential of analysis of short-term sequences of heart rate data in a time domain for continuous monitoring of levels of physiological stress however the value of HRV parameters in frequency domain for monitoring cycling exercise has not been established. The goal of this study was to assess whether HRV parameters in frequency domain differ depending on a stage of cycling exercise. We compared major HRV parameters in high, low and very low frequency ranges during rest, height of exercise, and recovery during cycling exercise. Our results indicated responsiveness of frequency-domain indices to different phases of cycling exercise program and their potential in monitoring autonomic balance and stress levels as a part of a tailored home-based telerehabilitation program. {\textcopyright} 2014 The authors and IOS Press.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE This study investigated whether short-term exposure to a passive online software application of purported subtle energy technology would affect heart rate variability (HRV) and associated autonomic nervous system measures. METHODS This was a randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled clinical trial (RCT). The study took place in a nonprofit laboratory in Emeryville, California. Twenty healthy, nonsmoking subjects (16 females), aged 40-75 years, participated. Quantum Code Technology™ (QCT), a purported subtle energy technology, was delivered through a passive software application (Heart+ App) on a smartphone placed {\textless}1 m from subjects who were seated and reading a catalog. HRV was measured for 5 min in triplicate for each condition via finger plethysmography using a Food and Drug Administration medically approved HRV measurement device. Measurements were made at baseline and 35 min following exposure to the software applications. The following parameters were calculated and analyzed: heart rate, total power, standard deviation node-to-node, root mean square sequential difference, low frequency to high frequency ratio (LF/HF), low frequency (LF), and high frequency (HF). RESULTS Paired samples t-tests showed that for the Heart+ App, mean LF/HF decreased (p = 9.5 × 10-4), while mean LF decreased in a trend (p = 0.06), indicating reduced sympathetic dominance. Root mean square sequential difference increased for the Heart+ App, showing a possible trend (p = 0.09). Post-pre differences in LF/HF for sham compared with the Heart+ App were also significant (p {\textless} 0.008) by independent t-test, indicating clinical relevance. CONCLUSIONS Significant beneficial changes in mean LF/HF, along with possible trends in mean LF and root mean square sequential difference, were observed in subjects following 35 min exposure to the Heart+ App that was working in the background on an active smartphone untouched by the subjects. This may be the first RCT to show that specific frequencies of a purported non-Hertzian type of subtle energy conveyed by software applications broadcast from personal electronic devices can be bioactive and beneficially impact autonomic nervous system balance.},

abstract = {Routine stress monitoring in daily life can predict potentially serious health impacts. Effective stress monitoring in medical and healthcare fields is dependent upon accurate determination of stress-related features. In this study, we determined the optimal stress-related features for effective monitoring of cumulative stress. We first investigated the effects of short- and long-term stress on various heart rate variability (HRV) features using a rodent model. Subsequently, we determined an optimal HRV feature set using support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE). Experimental results indicate that the HRV time domain features generally decrease under long-term stress, and the HRV frequency domain features have substantially significant differences under short-term stress. Further, an SVM classifier with a radial basis function kernel proved most accurate (93.11{\%}) when using an optimal HRV feature set comprising the mean of R-R intervals (mRR), the standard deviation of R-R intervals (SDRR), and the coefficient of variance of R-R intervals (CVRR) as time domain features, and the normalized low frequency (nLF) and the normalized high frequency (nHF) as frequency domain features. Our findings indicate that the optimal HRV features identified in this study can effectively and efficiently detect stress. This knowledge facilitates development of in-facility and mobile healthcare system designs to support stress monitoring in daily life.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is commonly used as a quantitative marker depicting the activity of autonomous nervous system (ANS) that may be related to mental stress. For mobile applications, short term ECG measurement may be used for HRV analysis since the conventional five minute long recordings might be inadequately long. Short term analysis of HRV features has been investigated mostly in ECG data from normal and cardiac patients. Thus, short term HRV features may not have any relevance on the assessment of acute mental stress. In this study, we obtained ultra short term HRV features from 24 subjects during baseline stage and Stroop color word test. We validated these HRV features by showing significant differences in HRV features existed between the two stages. Our results indicated that ultra short term analysis of heart rate and RR intervals within 10 s, RMSSD and PNN50 within 30 s, HF within 40 s, LF/HF, normalized LF, and normalized HF within 50 s could be reliably performed for monitoring mental stress in mobile settings.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) is traditionally derived from RR interval time series of electrocardiography (ECG). Photoplethysmography (PPG) also reflects the cardiac rhythm since the mechanical activity of the heart is coupled to its electrical activity. Thus, theoretically, PPG can be used for determining the interval between successive heartbeats and heart rate variability. However, the PPG wave lags behind the ECG signal by the time required for transmission of pulse wave. In this study, finger-tip PPG and standard lead II ECG were recorded for five minutes from 10 healthy subjects at rest. The results showed a high correlation (median = 0.97) between the ECG-derived RR intervals and PPG-derived peak-to-peak (PP) intervals. PP variability was accurate (0.1 ms) as compared to RR variability. The time domain, frequency domain and Poincar{\'{e}} plot HRV parameters computed using RR interval method and PP interval method showed no significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05). The error analysis also showed insignificant differences between the HRV indices obtained by the two methods. Bland-Altman analysis showed high degree of agreement between the two methods for all the parameters of HRV. Thus, HRV can also be reliably estimated from the PPG based PP interval method.},

abstract = {Background: The usefulness of heart rate variability (HRV) as a clinical research and diagnostic tool has been verified in numerous studies. The gold standard technique comprises analyzing time series of RR intervals from an electrocardiographic signal. However, some authors have used pulse cycle intervals instead of RR intervals, as they can be determined from a pulse wave (e.g. a photoplethysmographic) signal. This option is often called pulse rate variability (PRV), and utilizing it could expand the serviceability of pulse oximeters or simplify ambulatory monitoring of HRV. Methods: We review studies investigating the accuracy of PRV as an estimate of HRV, regardless of the underlying technology (photoplethysmography, continuous blood pressure monitoring or Finapresi, impedance plethysmography). Results/conclusions: Results speak in favor of sufficient accuracy when subjects are at rest, although many studies suggest that short-term variability is somewhat overestimated by PRV, which reflects coupling effects between respiration and the cardiovascular system. Physical activity and some mental stressors seem to impair the agreement of PRV and HRV, often to an inacceptable extent. Findings regarding the position of the sensor or the detection algorithm are not conclusive. Generally, quantitative conclusions are impeded by the fact that results of different studies are mostly incommensurable due to diverse experimental settings and/or methods of analysis. {\textcopyright} 2012 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {As the literature on heart rate variability (HRV) continues to burgeon, so too do the challenges faced with comparing results across studies conducted under different recording conditions and analysis options. Two important methodological considerations are (1) what sampling frequency (SF) to use when digitizing the electrocardiogram (ECG), and (2) whether to interpolate an ECG to enhance the accuracy of R-peak detection. Although specific recommendations have been offered on both points, the evidence used to support them can be seen to possess a number of methodological limitations. The present study takes a new and careful look at how SF influences 24 widely used time- and frequency-domain measures of HRV through the use of a Monte Carlo-based analysis of false positive rates (FPRs) associated with two-sample tests on independent sets of healthy subjects. HRV values from the first sample were calculated at 1000 Hz, and HRV values from the second sample were calculated at progressively lower SFs (and either with or without R-peak interpolation). When R-peak interpolation was applied prior to HRV calculation, FPRs for all HRV measures remained very close to 0.05 (i.e. the theoretically expected value), even when the second sample had an SF well below 100 Hz. Without R-peak interpolation, all HRV measures held their expected FPR down to 125 Hz (and far lower, in the case of some measures). These results provide concrete insights into the statistical validity of comparing datasets obtained at (potentially) very different SFs; comparisons which are particularly relevant for the domains of meta-analysis and mobile health.},

Both functions have been investigated for a long time; however, several challenges remain unsolved, such as the confusion between activities and the recognition of energy-consuming activities involving little or no movement. To solve these problems, we propose a novel approach using an accelerometer and electrocardiogram (ECG). First, we collected a database of six activities (sitting, standing, walking, ascending, resting and running) of 13 voluntary participants. We compared the HAR performances of three models with respect to the input data type (with none, all, or some of the heart-rate variability (HRV) parameters). The best recognition performance was 96.35{\%}, which was obtained with some selected HRV parameters. EE was also estimated for different choices of the input data type (with or without HRV parameters) and the model type (single and activity-specific). The best estimation performance was found in the case of the activity-specific model with HRV parameters. Our findings indicate that the use of human physiological data, obtained by wearable sensors, has a significant impact on both HAR and EE estimation, which are crucial functions in the mobile healthcare system.},

The PA exercises consisted of a vigorous-intensity activity of free choice. The MM exercises consisted of guided mindfulness meditation. The HRV-BF exercises consisted of slow breathing with a heart rate variability biofeedback device. Participants received daily reminders for their exercises and were contacted weekly to monitor their progress. They completed questionnaires prior to, directly after, and 6 weeks after the intervention. Results indicated an overall beneficial effect consisting of reduced stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and improved psychological well-being and sleep quality. No significant between-intervention effect was found, suggesting that PA, MM, and HRV-BF are equally effective in reducing stress and its related symptoms. These self-help interventions provide easily accessible help for people with stress complaints.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Acta Cardiologica. All rights reserved. Introduction Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction is associated with prognosis in coronary artery disease (CAD). We aimed to study the cardiac rehabilitation (CR) modulating effect on autonomic function, through heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate recovery (HRR) after exercise, in CAD patients and the associated factors. Methods This study is a retrospective analysis of CAD patients in sinus rhy thm who complete a single-centre CR programme and complementary evaluation including HRV study, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, echocardiogram. Results Our sample included 142 CAD patients (85.9{\%} male, 57.8 ± 10.2 years, 85{\%} post-acute coronary syndrome, 15{\%} stable CAD). There was a significant improvement in SDNN (120.7 ± 40.7 ms vs 127.6 ± 41.5 ms; P = 0.019), resting HR (71.3 ± 10.7 min -1 vs 69.0 ± 10.9 min -1 ; P = 0.015) and HRR (23.8 ± 12.3 min -1 vs 27.1 ± 12.5 min -1 ; P = 0.017) following CR. Lower erythrocyte sedimentation rate (OR 0.911; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.838-0.989, P = 0.027), normal left ventricular (LV) function/mild LV systolic dysfunction (OR 7.879; 95{\%} CI 2.753-17.351, P = 0.009) and SDNN lower than 100 ms (OR 9.325; 95{\%} CI 1.775-48.978, P = 0.008) were independently associated with SDNN improvement; quit smoking (OR 4.323; 95{\%} CI 1.136-16.454, P = 0.014) and abnormal HRR (OR 8.023; 95{\%} CI 1.049-64.811, P = 0.035) were independently associated with HRR improvement. Conclusion The cardiac rehabilitation programme induced a positive modulation of the autonomic function in CAD patients, as reflected by SDNN and HRR improvement. This benefit was associated with ANS baseline dysfunction, lower systemic inflammation, quit smoking and normal LV function to mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction.},

abstract = {Cardiac coherence biofeedback training consist on slowing one's breathing to 0.1 Hz in order to simulate the baroreflex sensitivity and increase the respiratory sinus arrhythmia efficiency. Several studies have shown that these breathing exercises can constitute an efficient therapy in many clinical contexts like cardiovascular diseases, asthma, fibromyalgia or post-traumatic stress. Such a non-intrusive therapeutic solution needs to be performed on an 8 to 10 weeks period. Even if some heart rate variability based solutions exist, they presented some mobility constrain rendering these cardiac / respiratory control technologies more difficult to perform on a daily used. In this paper, we present a new simplified smartphone based solution allowing people to process efficient cardiac coherence biofeedback exercises. Based on photo-plethysmographic imaging through the smartphone camera, this sensor-less technology allows controlling cardiac coherence biofeedback exercises through a simplified heart rate variability algorithm.},

abstract = {Background: An efficient cardiac rehabilitation programme (CRP) can improve the functional ability of patients after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Objective: To examine the effect of a CRP on parasympathetic reactivation and heart rate recovery (HRR) measured after a 6-min walk test (6MWT), and correlation with 6MWT distance and well-being after ACS. Methods: Eleven normoweight patients after ACS (BMI {\textless} 25 kg/m2; 10 males; mean [SD] age 61 [9] years) underwent an 8-week CRP. Before (pre-) and at weeks 4 (W4) and 8 (W8) during the CRP, they performed a 6MWT on a treadmill, followed by 10-min of seated passive recovery, with HRR and HR variability (HRV) recordings. HRR was measured at 1, 3, 5 and 10 min after the 6MWT (HRR1, HRR3, HRR5, HRR10), then modelized by a mono-exponential function. Time-domain (square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent normal R-R intervals [RMSSD]) and frequency-domain (with high- and low-frequency band powers) were used to analyse HRV. Participants completed a mental and physical well-being questionnaire at pre- and W8. Exhaustion after tests was assessed by the Borg scale. Pearson correlation was used to assess correlations. Results: HRR3, HRR5 and HRR10 increased by 37{\%}, 36{\%} and 28{\%}, respectively, between pre- and W8 (P {\textless} 0.05), and were positively correlated with change in 6MWT distance (r = 0.58, 0.66 and 0.76; P {\textless} 0.05). Percentage change in HRR3 was positively correlated with change in well-being (r = 0.70; P = 0.01). Parasympathic reactivation (RMSSD) was improved only during the first 30 sec of recovery (P = 0.04). Conclusion: Among patients undergoing a CRP after ACS, increased HRR after a 6MWT, especially at 3 min, was positively correlated with 6MWT distance and improved well-being. HRR raw data seem more sensitive than post-exercise HRV analysis for monitoring functional and autonomic improvement after ACS.},

Methods {\&} results: 29 young adult healthy volunteers underwent a simultaneous recording of heart rate using an ECG and a chest heart rate monitor at supine rest, during mental stress and active standing. Mean RR interval, Standard Deviation of Normal-to-Normal (SDNN) of RR intervals, and Root Mean Square of the Successive Differences (RMSSD) between RR intervals were computed in 168 pairs of 5-minute epochs by in-house software on a PC (only sinus beats) and by mobile application “ELITEHRV” on a smartphone (no beat type identification).

abstract = {Objective Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is characterised by persistent fatigue, exhaustion, and several physical complaints. Research has shown cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and graded exercise training (GET) to be the most effective treatments. In a first step we aimed to assess the efficacy of heart rate variability biofeedback therapy (HRV-BF) as a treatment method comprising cognitive and behavioural strategies and GET in the pilot trial. In a second step we aimed to compare both interventions with regard to specific parameters. Methods The study was conducted in an outpatient treatment setting. A total of 28 women with CFS (50.3 ± 9.3 years) were randomly assigned to receive either eight sessions of HRV-BF or GET. The primary outcome was fatigue severity. Secondary outcomes were mental and physical quality of life and depression. Data were collected before and after the intervention as well as at a 5-month follow-up. Results General fatigue improved significantly after both HRV-BF and GET. Specific cognitive components of fatigue, mental quality of life, and depression improved significantly after HRV-BF only. Physical quality of life improved significantly after GET. There were significant differences between groups regarding mental quality of life and depression favouring HRV-BF. Conclusion Both interventions reduce fatigue. HRV-BF seems to have additional effects on components of mental health, including depression, whereas GET seems to emphasise components of physical health. These data offer implications for further research on combining HRV-BF and GET in patients with CFS.

However, there is a stunning lack of practical tools for effective stress management that can help people navigate through their daily stress. This paper presents the feasibility evaluation of StressHacker, a smartwatch-based system designed to continuously and passively monitor one's stress level using bio-signals obtained from the on-board sensors. With the proliferation of smartwatches, StressHacker is highly accessible and suited for daily use. Our preliminary evaluation is based on 300 hours of data collected in a real-life setting (12 subjects, 29 days). The result suggests that StressHacker is capable of reliably capturing daily stress dynamics (precision = 86.1{\%}, recall = 91.2{\%}), thus with great potential to enable seamless and personalized stress management.},

abstract = {Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia are directly associated with autonomic flexibility, self-regulation and well-being, and inversely associated with physiological stress, psychological stress and pathology. Yoga enhances autonomic activity, mitigates stress and benefits stress-related clinical conditions, yet the relationship between autonomic activity and psychophysiological responses during yoga practices and stressful stimuli has not been widely explored. This experimental study explored the relationship between HRV, mood states and flow experiences in regular yoga practitioners (YP), non-yoga practitioners (NY) and people with metabolic syndrome (MetS), during Mental Arithmetic Stress Test (MAST) and various yoga practices. The study found that the MAST placed a cardio-autonomic burden in all participants with the YP group showing the greatest reactivity and the most rapid recovery, while the MetS group had significantly blunted recovery. The YP group also reported a heightened experience of flow and positive mood states compared to NY and MetS groups as well as having a higher vagal tone during all resting conditions. These results suggest yoga practitioners have a greater homeostatic capacity and autonomic, metabolic and physiological resilience. Further studies are now needed to determine if regular yoga practice may improve autonomic flexibility in non-yoga practitioners and metabolic syndrome patients.

In this study we investigated the utility of the smartphone-derived HRV score to predict and diagnose AMS at HA. Twenty-one healthy adults were investigated at baseline at 1400 m and over 10 days during a trek to 5140 m. HRV was recorded using the ithlete HRV device. Acute mountain sickness occurred in 11 subjects (52.4{\%}) at {\textgreater}2650 m. HRV inversely correlated with AMS Scores (r = −0.26; 95{\%} CI, −0.38 to −0.13: P {\textless} 0.001). HRV significantly fell at 3700, 4100, and 5140 m versus low altitude. HRV scores were lower in those with both mild (69.7 ± 14.0) and severe AMS (67.1 ± 13.1) versus those without AMS (77.5 ± 13.1; effect size n2 = 0.043: P = 0.007). The HRV score was weakly predictive of severe AMS (AUC 0.74; 95{\%} CI, 0.58-0.89: P = 0.006). The change (delta) in the HRV Score (compared with baseline at 1400 m) was a moderate diagnostic marker of severe AMS (AUC 0.80; 95{\%} CI, 0.70-0.90; P = 0.0004). A fall in the HRV score of {\textgreater}5 had a sensitivity of 83{\%} and specificity of 60{\%} to identify severe AMS (likelihood ratio 1.9). Baseline HRV at 1400 m was not predictive of either AMS at higher altitudes. The ithlete HRV score can be used to help in the identification of severe AMS; however, a baseline score is not predictive of future AMS development at HA.},

Methods: The Deep ECGNet was developed through various experiments and analysis of ECG waveforms. We proposed the optimal recurrent and convolutional neural networks architecture, and also the optimal convolution filter length (related to the P, Q, R, S, and T wave durations of ECG) and pooling length (related to the heart beat period) based on the optimization experiments and analysis on the waveform characteristics of ECG signals.

This review aims to place sympathovagal balance as an essential element to be considered in management for cardiovascular disease patients who benefit from a cardiac rehabilitation program. Many studies showed that exercise training, as non-pharmacologic treatment, plays an important role in enhancing sympathovagal balance and could normalize levels of markers of sympathetic flow measured by microneurography, heart rate variability or plasma catecholamine levels. This alteration positively affects prognosis with cardiovascular disease. In general, cardiac rehabilitation programs include moderate-intensity and continuous aerobic exercise. Other forms of activities such as high-intensity interval training, breathing exercises, relaxation and transcutaneous electrical stimulation can improve sympathovagal balance and should be implemented in cardiac rehabilitation programs. Currently, the exercise training programs in cardiac rehabilitation are individualized to optimize health outcomes. The sports science concept of the heart rate variability (HRV)-vagal index used to manage exercise sessions (for a goal of performance) could be implemented in cardiac rehabilitation to improve cardiovascular fitness and autonomic nervous system function.},

abstract = {Introduction: Research suggests that people with schizophrenia have autonomic dysfunctions. These have been linked to functioning problems, symptoms and considered a risk factor for illness chronicity. The aim of this study is to introduce a new Mobile Health (mHealth) method using wearable technology to assessing autonomic activity in people's everyday life. We aim to evaluate the new method acceptability and characterise the association between schizophrenia illness features and autonomic abnormalities. Method: Thirty participants with schizophrenia and 25 controls were asked to wear a mHealth device measuring autonomic activity and movements during their normal everyday life. Measures of device use acceptability were collected from all participants. Participants with schizophrenia were also assessed for symptoms and functioning levels. Measures of heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA) and movement were collected by the device and groups were compared. Correlation between physiological measures, functioning, symptoms and medication levels were assessed in people with schizophrenia. Results: The mHealth device method proved to be acceptable and produced reliable measures of autonomic activity and behaviour. Compared to controls, people with schizophrenia showed lower levels of HRV, movement and functioning. In people with schizophrenia illness severity, particularly positive symptoms, was associated with parasympathetic deregulation. Conclusions: Autonomic abnormalities can be detected using wearable technology from people's everyday life. These are in line with previous research and support the notion that autonomic deregulation are relevant illness features for mental and physical health in schizophrenia. This method may be developed as a monitoring system for well-being and relapse prevention.},

Cohorts were compared with respect to life-space mobility in a continuum of environments ranging from home to outside town, using analysis of variance and chi-square tests. Baseline personal, assistive device, intervention, and environmental factors associated with life-space mobility were explored with age-adjusted linear regression models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSETTING: Four Canadian rehabilitation centers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPARTICIPANTS: Random sample of middle-aged and older adults (N=116; 50-89y) living in the community or residential care.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERVENTION: Procurement of a powered wheelchair or scooter.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Life-Space Assessment composite score.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Cohort comparisons showed higher frequency of outings for PMD users in the neighborhood (P{\textless}.001) and around home (P{\textless}.05) and significantly greater Life-Space Assessment composite scores for initial and long-term users than for the reference group (P{\textless}.05). Factors such as sex, the nature of activities, and device type explained variances in Life-Space Assessment composite score ranging from 15.9{\%} to 18.0{\%} (P{\textless}.006).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Life-space mobility increases after PMD use and remains stable across the stages of initial and long-term use. To appreciate the impact of PMDs, clinicians should consider the environment and a combination of personal and device factors that are associated with the range of life-space mobility in the first 18 months after procurement.},

Livers from four pups and ten adult harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) stranded in San Francisco Bay (SFB) and the Gulf of Maine (GOM) were analyzed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and their hydroxylated metabolites (OH-PCBs). We used GC-ECD and GC-NCI/MS to investigate the presence of 28 PCBs and 8 OH-PCB metabolites, respectively. Sigma(28)PCB concentrations (di- to octa-CBs) ranged from 1.81 to 35.9 microg/g lipid with a median of 6.53 for the seal pups and 2.31 to 249 microg/g lipid with a median of 28.9 for the adult seals. Sigma(8)OH-PCB concentrations (penta- to hepta-OH-PCBs) ranged from 0.02 to 0.69 microg/g lipid with a median of 0.04 for the adult seals, i.e., at much lower concentrations than those for PCBs. Ratios of OH-PCBs to PCBs (0.24{\%} on average) were comparable to those in beluga whale, but were lower than ratios in human livers. The OH-PCB profiles were slightly different between SFB and GOM seal livers, although similar PCB congener patterns were observed. Generally, 4-OH-CB107 was found predominantly in seal livers and was the only OH-PCB detectable in most of seal pup livers. This study provides information on OH-PCBs in seals, adding to the scarce exposure data for these chemicals.},

abstract = {Autonomic dysfunction is implicated in prehypertension, and previous studies have suggested that therapies that improve modulation of sympathovagal balance, such as biofeedback and slow abdominal breathing, are effective in patients with prehypertension at rest. However, considering that psychophysiological stressors may be associated with greater cardiovascular risk in prehypertensives, it is important to investigate whether heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BF) results in equivalent effects on autonomic cardiovascular responses control during stressful conditions in prehypertensives. A total of 32 college students with prehypertension were enrolled and randomly assigned to HRV-BF (n=12), slow abdominal breathing (SAB, n=10) or no treatment (control, n=10) groups. Then, a training experiment consisting of 15 sessions was employed to compare the effect of each intervention on the following cardiovascular response indicators before and after intervention: heart rate (HR); heart rate variability (HRV) components; blood volume pulse amplitude (BVPamp); galvanic skin response; respiration rate (RSP); and blood pressure. In addition, the cold pressor test and the mental arithmetic challenge test were also performed over two successive days before and after the invention as well as after 3 months of follow-up. A significant decrease in HR and RSP and a significant increase in BVPamp were observed after the HRV-BF intervention (P{\textless}0.001). For the HRV analysis, HRV-BF significantly reduced the ratio of low-frequency power to high-frequency power (the LF/HF ratio, P{\textless}0.001) and increased the normalized high-frequency power (HFnm) (P{\textless}0.001) during the stress tests, and an added benefit over SAB by improving HRV was also observed. In the 3-month follow-up study, similar effects on RSP, BVPamp, LF/HF and HFnm were observed in the HRV-BF group compared with the SAB group. HRV-BF training contributes to the beneficial effect of reducing the stress-related cardiovascular response in prehypertensives by improving autonomic sympathovagal modulation.Journal of Human Hypertension advance online publication, 30 April 2015; doi:10.1038/jhh.2015.27.},

It has been applied to patients with various cardiovascular disorders. The purpose of this study was to investigate the practical feasibility and the psychophysiological effects of biofeedback applied to heart rate variability (HRV biofeedback) in order to increase cardiac coherence in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients participating in a cardiac rehabilitation programme.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: In this randomised and controlled study, 31 CAD patients were randomly assigned to an experimental or to a control group. The experimental group participated in a programme of 10 sessions of cardiac coherence biofeedback training, in addition to the rehabilitation programme. The control group participated in the usual cardiac rehabilitation programme only. Physiological variables (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, SDNN) and psychosocial variables (anxiety, depression, type D personality) were measured at the start and at the end of the programme in both groups. Statistical comparisons assessed the inter and intra group differences. The small sample size precludes any firm conclusions concerning the effect of cardiac coherence biofeedback on physiological or psychological variables. However, we observed a significant increase of the percentage of cardiac coherence, in relation with an increased SDNN index.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the practical feasibility of cardiac coherence biofeedback training in CAD patients. Further research is desirable to investigate the potential benefit of cardiac coherence biofeedback as an adjunct to stress management in cardiac rehabilitation.},

However, there lacks a practical and unobtrusive means to obtain real-time and longitudinal stress information. In this paper, we attempt to derive a convenient HRV-based (heart rate variability) biomarker named cHRV, which can be used to reliably reflect stress dynamics. cHRV's key advantage lies in its low maintenance and high practicality. It can be efficiently calculated only using data from photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, the mainstream heart rate sensor embedded in most of the consumer wearables like Apple Watch. Benefiting from the proliferation of wearables, cHRV is ideal for day-to-day stress monitoring. To evaluate its feasibility and performance, we have conducted 14 in-lab controlled experiments. The result shows that the proposed cHRV has strong correlation with the stress dynamics (r{\textgreater}0.95), therefore exhibits great potential for continuous stress assessment.},

However, it is not known about the low intensity of RE training that could modify the heart rate variability (HRV), muscular strength and endurance in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). AIM To investigate the effects of high repetition/low load resistance training (HR/LL-RT) program on HRV and muscular strength and endurance in CAD patients. DESIGN Randomized and controlled trial. SETTING Patients seen at the Cardiopulmonary Physical Therapy Laboratory between May 2011 and November 2013. POPULATION Twenty male patients with CAD were randomized to a training group (61.3±5.2 years) or control group (61±4.4 years). METHODS 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) maneuver, discontinuous exercise test on the leg press (DET-L), and resting HRV were performed before and after 8 weeks of HR/LL-RT on a 45° leg press. RMSSD, SD1, mean HR and ApEn indices were calculated. The HR/LL-RT program consisted of a lower limb exercise using a 45° leg press; 3 sets of 20 repetitions, two times a week. The initial load was set at 30{\%} of the 1-RM load and the duration of the HR/LL-RT program was performed for 8 weeks. RESULTS After 8 weeks of HR/LL-RT there were significant increases of RMSSD and SD1 indices in the training group only (P{\textless}0.05). There was a significant decrease in mean HR after HR/LL-RT in the training group (P{\textless}0.05). There was a significantly higher ApEn after in the training group (P{\textless}0.05). There were significantly higher values in the training group in contrast to the control group (P{\textless}0.05). CONCLUSION These results show positive improvements on HRV, as well as muscle strength and endurance in CAD patients. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT Eight weeks of HR/LL-RT is an effective sufficient to beneficially modify important outcomes as HRV, muscle strength and endurance in CAD patients.},

abstract = {Measures of heart rate variability (HRV) are widely used to assess autonomic nervous system (ANS) function. The signal from which they are derived requires accurate determination of the interval between successive heartbeats; it can be recorded via electrocardiography (ECG), which is both non-invasive and widely available. However, methodological problems inherent in the recording and analysis of ECG traces have motivated a search for alternatives. Photoplethysmography (PPG) constitutes another means of determining the timing of cardiac cycles via continuous monitoring of changes in blood volume in a portion of the peripheral microvasculature. This technique measures pulse waveforms, which in some instances may prove a practical basis for HRV analysis. We investigated the feasibility of using earlobe PPG to analyse HRV by applying the same analytic process to PPG and ECG recordings made simultaneously. Comparison of 5-minute recordings demonstrated a very high degree of correlation in the temporal and frequency domains and in nonlinear dynamic analyses between HRV measures derived from PPG and ECG. Our results confirm that PPG provides accurate interpulse intervals from which HRV measures can be accurately derived in healthy subjects under ideal conditions, suggesting this technique may prove a practical alternative to ECG for HRV analysis. This finding is of particular relevance to the care of patients suffering from peripheral hyperkinesia or tremor, which make fingertip PPG recording impractical, and following clinical interventions known to introduce electrical artefacts into the electrocardiogram.},

abstract = {Objective: The association between cardiovascular reactivity and major depressive disorder (MDD) remains unclear. This study aimed to examine this association via reactive heart rate variability (HRV) in a well-diagnosed first-episode MDD group and a control group. Methods: A total of 160 physically healthy, drug-naive patients presenting with their first-episode MDD and 50 healthy controls were recruited. All participants underwent a 5-min electrocardiography at rest and during a mental arithmetic task. Depression severity was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI). Results: HRV measures that showed between-group differences at rest did not reached significance during mental stress. In contrast, HRV measures that revealed between-group differences during stress did not reach significance at rest. In response to mental stress, HRV measures did not significantly change in both group. However, LF and HF in response to stress were different between groups. Patients with MDD revealed an increasing trend in HF and a decreasing trend in LF; conversely, healthy controls had a decreasing trend in HF and an increasing trend in LF. BDI scores correlated with changes in heart rate in the control group. Conclusions: The fundamental change to reactive HRV in patients with first-episode MDD appears qualitative, not quantitative. A distinctly reverse trend in reactive HRV measures were evident between these two groups. Moreover, patients with MDD showed entirely distinct changes in reactive HRV from those in resting HRV. We suggest that in patients with MDD, autonomic system shifts to sympathetic dominance at rest but toward parasympathetic dominance in response to stress. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

RESULTS Measurement equipment for recording of interbeat intervals should have a high storage capacity and a sampling rate of 1000 Hz ideally. The quality criteria of freedom of feedback (small, little disruptive), robustness and a non-invasive measurement (e. g. freeze-electrodes or sensors) have to be fulfilled. In addition to the Holter ECG, several portable heart rate watch and chest belt systems provide adequate validity and good applicability. DISCUSSION The Holter ECG is still the gold standard for the measurement of NN intervals and for the analysis of HRV. Modern heart rate watches show a good correlation with the conformance of freedom from discomfort, robustness and non-invasive measurement and are a good alternative due to the lower disturbance of test persons.},

abstract = {The Poincare plot emerges as an effective tool for assessing cardiovascular autonomic regulation. It displays nonlinear characteristics of heart rate variability (HRV) from electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings and gives a global view of the long range of ECG signals. In the telemedicine or computer-aided diagnosis system, it would offer significant auxiliary information for diagnosis if the patterns of the Poincare plots can be automatically classified. Therefore, we developed an automatic classification system to distinguish five geometric patterns of the Poincare plots from four types of cardiac arrhythmias. The statistics features are designed on measurements and an ensemble classifier of three types of neural networks is proposed. Aiming at the difficulty to set a proper threshold for classifying the multiple categories, the threshold selection strategy is analyzed. 24 h ECG monitoring recordings from 674 patients, which have four types of cardiac arrhythmias, are adopted for recognition. For comparison, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers with linear and Gaussian kernels are also applied. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the extracted features and the better performance of the designed classifier. Our study can be applied to diagnose the corresponding sinus rhythm and arrhythmia substrates disease automatically in the telemedicine and computer-aided diagnosis system.},

abstract = {Heart rate (HR) and normalized pulse volume (NPV) are physiological indices that have been used in a diversity of psychological studies. However, measuring these indices often requires laborious processes. We therefore developed a new smartphone program, named iPhysioMeter, that makes it possible to measure beat-by-beat HR and ln NPV using only a smartphone. We examined its accuracy against conventional laboratory measures. Mental stress tasks were used to alter HR and ln NPV in 12 participants. Bland-Altman analyses revealed negligible proportional bias for HR and ln NPV or for their change values, expressed as $\Delta$HR and $\Delta$ln NPV. However, a relatively large fixed bias did emerge for ln NPV, as well as a small one for $\Delta$ln NPV, although both were within the limits of agreement. These findings suggest that iPhysioMeter can yield valid measures of the absolute level of HR and of relative changes in ln NPV.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BFB) has been shown as useful tool to manage stress in various populations. The present study was designed to investigate whether the biofeedback-based stress management tool consisting of rhythmic breathing, actively self-generated positive emotions and a portable biofeedback device induce changes in athletes' HRV, EEG patterns, and self-reported anxiety and self-esteem. The study involved 41 healthy male athletes, aged 16-21 (mean 18.34 +/- 1.36) years. Participants were randomly divided into two groups: biofeedback and control. Athletes in the biofeedback group received HRV biofeedback training, athletes in the control group didn't receive any intervention. During the randomized controlled trial (days 0-21), the mean anxiety score declined significantly for the intervention group (change-4 p {\textless} 0.001) but not for the control group (p = 0.817). In addition, as compared to the control, athletes in biofeedback group showed substantial and statistically significant improvement in heart rate variability indices and changes in power spectra of both theta and alpha brain waves, and alpha asymmetry. These changes suggest better self-control in the central nervous system and better flexibility of the autonomic nervous system in the group that received biofeedback training. A HRV biofeedback-based stress management tool may be beneficial for stress reduction for young male athletes.},

@article{Piotrowicz2016,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction appears in the course of both chronic heart failure (CHF) and depression. Comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation (CCR), apart from improving physical capacity, can reduce depressive symptoms and leads to the restoration of ANS function among CHF patients. The purpose was to evaluate the influence of the reversion of depression (measured by Beck Depression Inventory [BDI] score, cut point {\textless}10) and the physical capacity improvement (measured by peak oxygen consumption [peak VO2 ; ml/kg per minute]) on the sympathovagal balance (measured by low/high frequency ratio [LF/HF]) after CCR in CHF patients. METHODS: The study group comprised 111 CHF patients (New York Heart Association II-III; left ventricular ejection fraction {\textless}/= 40{\%}). Patients were randomized (2:1) to 8-week CCR based on Nordic walking training (five times weekly) at 40-70{\%} of maximal heart rate, training group (TG) n = 77, or to control group (CG) n = 34. The effectiveness of CCR was assessed by changes-delta (Delta) in LF/HF, BDI score, and peak VO2 , as a result of comparing these parameters from the beginning and the end of the program. RESULTS: Eventually, 46 patients in TG and 23 patients in CG were eligible for simultaneous ANS and psychological status analysis. Only in TG the LF/HF decreased 2.06 +/- 1.14 versus 1.19 +/- 0.80 (P {\textless} 0.0001) and peak VO2 increased 16.83 +/- 3.72 versus 19.14 +/- 4.20 ml/kg per minute (P {\textless} 0.0001). Favorable results in CG were not observed. The differences between TG and CG were significant: Deltapeak VO2 (P {\textless} 0.0001); DeltaLF/HF (P = 0.0001). Depressive symptoms were substantially reduced in both groups (TG, P = 0.0006; CG, P = 0.0490). Nevertheless, the greatest improvement of sympathovagal balance was observed in patients whose depression was reversed, thanks to the CCR in comparison to other patients from TG and the entire CG. CONCLUSION: Positive effect of the sympatho-parasympathetic balance obtained during the home CCR based on Nordic walking training results from the additive effects of the reversion of depression and physical capacity improvement in CHF patients.},
