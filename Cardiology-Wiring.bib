abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is common practice to restore and maintain sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure. This approach is based in part on data indicating that atrial fibrillation is a predictor of death in patients with heart failure and suggesting that the suppression of atrial fibrillation may favorably affect the outcome. However, the benefits and risks of this approach have not been adequately studied. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial comparing the maintenance of sinus rhythm (rhythm control) with control of the ventricular rate (rate control) in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35{\%} or less, symptoms of congestive heart failure, and a history of atrial fibrillation. The primary outcome was the time to death from cardiovascular causes. RESULTS: A total of 1376 patients were enrolled (682 in the rhythm-control group and 694 in the rate-control group) and were followed for a mean of 37 months. Of these patients, 182 (27{\%}) in the rhythm-control group died from cardiovascular causes, as compared with 175 (25{\%}) in the rate-control group (hazard ratio in the rhythm-control group, 1.06; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.86 to 1.30; P = 0.59 by the log-rank test). Secondary outcomes were similar in the two groups, including death from any cause (32{\%} in the rhythm-control group and 33{\%} in the rate-control group), stroke (3{\%} and 4{\%}, respectively), worsening heart failure (28{\%} and 31{\%}), and the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, stroke, or worsening heart failure (43{\%} and 46{\%}). There were also no significant differences favoring either strategy in any predefined subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure, a routine strategy of rhythm control does not reduce the rate of death from cardiovascular causes, as compared with a rate-control strategy.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Despite improvements in the management of atrial fibrillation, patients with this condition remain at increased risk for cardiovascular complications. It is unclear whether early rhythm-control therapy can reduce this risk. METHODS In this international, investigator-initiated, parallel-group, open, blinded-outcome-assessment trial, we randomly assigned patients who had early atrial fibrillation (diagnosed ≤1 year before enrollment) and cardiovascular conditions to receive either early rhythm control or usual care. Early rhythm control included treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs or atrial fibrillation ablation after randomization. Usual care limited rhythm control to the management of atrial fibrillation-related symptoms. The first primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, stroke, or hospitalization with worsening of heart failure or acute coronary syndrome; the second primary outcome was the number of nights spent in the hospital per year. The primary safety outcome was a composite of death, stroke, or serious adverse events related to rhythm-control therapy. Secondary outcomes, including symptoms and left ventricular function, were also evaluated. RESULTS In 135 centers, 2789 patients with early atrial fibrillation (median time since diagnosis, 36 days) underwent randomization. The trial was stopped for efficacy at the third interim analysis after a median of 5.1 years of follow-up per patient. A first-primary-outcome event occurred in 249 of the patients assigned to early rhythm control (3.9 per 100 person-years) and in 316 patients assigned to usual care (5.0 per 100 person-years) (hazard ratio, 0.79; 96{\%} confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.94; P = 0.005). The mean (±SD) number of nights spent in the hospital did not differ significantly between the groups (5.8±21.9 and 5.1±15.5 days per year, respectively; P = 0.23). The percentage of patients with a primary safety outcome event did not differ significantly between the groups; serious adverse events related to rhythm-control therapy occurred in 4.9{\%} of the patients assigned to early rhythm control and 1.4{\%} of the patients assigned to usual care. Symptoms and left ventricular function at 2 years did not differ significantly between the groups. CONCLUSIONS Early rhythm-control therapy was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular outcomes than usual care among patients with early atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular conditions.

abstract = {Aims: Electrical cardioversion is commonly performed to restore sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), but it is unsuccessful in 10-12{\%} of attempts. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a novel cardioversion protocol for this arrhythmia. Methods and results: Consecutive elective cardioversion attempts for AF between October 2012 and July 2017 at a tertiary cardiovascular centre before (Phase I) and after (Phase II) implementing the Ottawa AF cardioversion protocol (OAFCP) as an institutional initiative in July 2015 were evaluated. The primary outcome was cardioversion success, defined as ≥2 consecutive sinus beats or atrial-paced beats in patients with implanted cardiac devices. Secondary outcomes were first shock success, sustained success (sinus or atrial-paced rhythm on 12-lead electrocardiogram prior to discharge from hospital), and procedural complications. Cardioversion was successful in 459/500 (91.8{\%}) in Phase I compared with 386/389 (99.2{\%}) in Phase II (P {\textless} 0.001). This improvement persisted after adjusting for age, body mass index, amiodarone use, and transthoracic impedance using modified Poisson regression [adjusted relative risk 1.08, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.11; P {\textless} 0.001] and when analysed as an interrupted time series (change in level +9.5{\%}, 95{\%} CI 6.8-12.1{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001). The OAFCP was also associated with greater first shock success (88.4{\%} vs. 79.2{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001) and sustained success (91.6{\%} vs 84.7{\%}; P=0.002). No serious complications occurred. Conclusion: Implementing the OAFCP was associated with a 7.4{\%} absolute increase in cardioversion success and increases in first shock and sustained success without serious procedural complications. Its use could safely improve cardioversion success in patients with AF. Clinical trial number: www.clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT02192957.},

abstract = {The occurrence of ventricular premature depolarizations in survivors of myocardial infarction is a risk factor for subsequent sudden death, but whether antiarrhythmic therapy reduces the risk is not known. The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) is evaluating the effect of antiarrhythmic therapy (encainide, flecainide, or moricizine) in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic ventricular arrhythmia (six or more ventricular premature beats per hour) after myocardial infarction. As of March 30, 1989, 2309 patients had been recruited for the initial drug-titration phase of the study: 1727 (75 percent) had initial suppression of their arrhythmia (as assessed by Holter recording) through the use of one of the three study drugs and had been randomly assigned to receive active drug or placebo. During an average of 10 months of follow-up, the patients treated with active drug had a higher rate of death from arrhythmia than the patients assigned to placebo. Encainide and flecainide accounted for the excess of deaths from arrhythmia and nonfatal cardiac arrests (33 of 730 patients taking encainide or flecainide [4.5 percent]; 9 of 725 taking placebo [1.2 percent]; relative risk, 3.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 8.5). They also accounted for the higher total mortality (56 of 730 [7.7 percent] and 22 of 725 [3.0 percent], respectively; relative risk, 2.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 4.5). Because of these results, the part of the trial involving encainide and flecainide has been discontinued. We conclude that neither encainide nor flecainide should be used in the treatment of patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic ventricular arrhythmia after myocardial infarction, even though these drugs may be effective initially in suppressing ventricular arrhythmia. Whether these results apply to other patients who might be candidates for antiarrhythmic therapy is unknown. {\textcopyright} 1989, Massachusetts Medical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background - Whether catheter ablation (CA) is superior to amiodarone (AMIO) for the treatment of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with heart failure is unknown. Methods and Results - This was an open-label, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter study. Patients with persistent AF, dual-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator, New York Heart Association II to III, and left ventricular ejection fraction {\textless}40{\%} within the past 6 months were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to undergo CA for AF (group 1, n=102) or receive AMIO (group 2, n=101). Recurrence of AF was the primary end point. All-cause mortality and unplanned hospitalization were the secondary end points. Patients were followed up for a minimum of 24 months. At the end of follow-up, 71 (70{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval, 60{\%}-78{\%}) patients in group 1 were recurrence free after an average of 1.4±0.6 procedures in comparison with 34 (34{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval, 25{\%}-44{\%}) in group 2 (log-rank P{\textless}0.001). The success rate of CA in the different centers after a single procedure ranged from 29{\%} to 61{\%}. After adjusting for covariates in the multivariable model, AMIO therapy was found to be significantly more likely to fail (hazard ratio, 2.5; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.5-4.3; P{\textless}0.001) than CA. Over the 2-year follow-up, the unplanned hospitalization rate was (32 [31{\%}] in group 1 and 58 [57{\%}] in group 2; P{\textless}0.001), showing 45{\%} relative risk reduction (relative risk, 0.55; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.39-0.76). A significantly lower mortality was observed in CA (8 [8{\%}] versus AMIO (18 [18{\%}]; P=0.037). Conclusions - This multicenter randomized study shows that CA of AF is superior to AMIO in achieving freedom from AF at long-term follow-up and reducing unplanned hospitalization and mortality in patients with heart failure and persistent AF.},

abstract = {Background There are two approaches to the treat- ment of atrial fibrillation: one is cardioversion and treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm, and the other is the use of rate-controlling drugs, allowing atrial fibrillation to persist. In both ap- proaches, the use of anticoagulant drugs is recom- mended. Methods We conducted a randomized, multicenter comparison of these two treatment strategies in pa- tients with atrial fibrillation and a high risk of stroke or death. The primary end point was overall mortality. Results A total of 4060 patients (mean [±SD] age, 69.7±9.0 years) were enrolled in the study; 70.8 per- cent had a history of hypertension, and 38.2 percent had coronary artery disease. Of the 3311 patients with echocardiograms, the left atrium was enlarged in 64.7 percent and left ventricular function was depressed in 26.0 percent. There were 356 deaths among the patients assigned to rhythm-control therapy and 310 deaths among those assigned to rate-control therapy (mortality at five years, 23.8 percent and 21.3 percent, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.15 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.34]; P=0.08). More patients in the rhythm-control group than in the rate-control group were hospitalized, and there were more adverse drug effects in the rhythm-control group as well. In both groups, the majority of strokes occurred after warfarin had been stopped or when the international normal- ized ratio was subtherapeutic. Conclusions Management of atrial fibrillation with the rhythm-control strategy offers no survival advan- tage over the rate-control strategy, and there are po- tential advantages, such as a lower risk of adverse drug effects, with the rate-control strategy. Anticoag- ulation should be continued in this group of high-risk patients. (N},

abstract = {Spatial dispersion of repolarization in the form of transmural, trans-septal and apico-basal dispersion of repolarization creates voltage gradients that inscribe the J wave and T wave of the EGG. Amplification of this spatial dispersion of repolarization (SDR) underlies the development of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias associated with inherited or acquired ion channelopathies giving rise to the long QT, short QT and Brugada syndromes (BrS). This review focuses on the role of spatial dispersion of repolarization in drug-induced arrhythmogenesis associated with the long QT and BrS. In the long QT syndrome, drug-induced amplification of SDR is often secondary to preferential prolongation of the action potential duration (APD) of M cells, whereas in the BrS, it is thought to be due to selective abbreviation of the APD of right ventricular epicardium. Among the challenges ahead is the identification of a means to quantitate SDR non-invasively. This review also discusses the value of the interval between the peak and end of the T wave (Tpeak-Tend, Tp-Te) as an index of SDR and transmural dispersion of repolarization, in particular.

abstract = {Importance: Catheter ablation is effective in restoring sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation (AF), but its effects on long-term mortality and stroke risk are uncertain. Objective: To determine whether catheter ablation is more effective than conventional medical therapy for improving outcomes in AF. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Catheter Ablation vs Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation trial is an investigator-initiated, open-label, multicenter, randomized trial involving 126 centers in 10 countries. A total of 2204 symptomatic patients with AF aged 65 years and older or younger than 65 years with 1 or more risk factors for stroke were enrolled from November 2009 to April 2016, with follow-up through December 31, 2017. Interventions: The catheter ablation group (n = 1108) underwent pulmonary vein isolation, with additional ablative procedures at the discretion of site investigators. The drug therapy group (n = 1096) received standard rhythm and/or rate control drugs guided by contemporaneous guidelines. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was a composite of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. Among 13 prespecified secondary end points, 3 are included in this report: all-cause mortality; total mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization; and AF recurrence. Results: Of the 2204 patients randomized (median age, 68 years; 37.2{\%} female; 42.9{\%} had paroxysmal AF and 57.1{\%} had persistent AF), 89.3{\%} completed the trial. Of the patients assigned to catheter ablation, 1006 (90.8{\%}) underwent the procedure. Of the patients assigned to drug therapy, 301 (27.5{\%}) ultimately received catheter ablation. In the intention-to-treat analysis, over a median follow-up of 48.5 months, the primary end point occurred in 8.0{\%} (n = 89) of patients in the ablation group vs 9.2{\%} (n = 101) of patients in the drug therapy group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86 [95{\%} CI, 0.65-1.15]; P =.30). Among the secondary end points, outcomes in the ablation group vs the drug therapy group, respectively, were 5.2{\%} vs 6.1{\%} for all-cause mortality (HR, 0.85 [95{\%} CI, 0.60-1.21]; P =.38), 51.7{\%} vs 58.1{\%} for death or cardiovascular hospitalization (HR, 0.83 [95{\%} CI, 0.74-0.93]; P =.001), and 49.9{\%} vs 69.5{\%} for AF recurrence (HR, 0.52 [95{\%} CI, 0.45-0.60]; P {\textless}.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with AF, the strategy of catheter ablation, compared with medical therapy, did not significantly reduce the primary composite end point of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. However, the estimated treatment effect of catheter ablation was affected by lower-than-expected event rates and treatment crossovers, which should be considered in interpreting the results of the trial.},

abstract = {Background: Atrial fibrillation occurs frequently in patients with congestive heart failure and commonly results in clinical deterioration and hospitalization. Sinus rhythm may be maintained with antiarrhythmic drugs, but some of these drugs increase the risk of death. Methods: We studied 1518 patients-with symptomatic congestive heart failure and severe left ventricular dysfunction at 34 Danish hospitals. We randomly assigned 762 patients to receive dofetilide, a novel class III antiarrhythmic agent, and 756 to receive placebo in a double-blind study. Treatment was initiated in the hospital and included three days of cardiac monitoring and dose adjustment. The primary end point was death from any cause. Results: During a median follow-up of 18 months, 311 patients in the dofetilide group (41 percent) and 317 patients in the placebo group (42 percent) died (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.81 to 1.11). Treatment with dofetilide significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization for worsening congestive heart failure (risk ratio, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.63 to 0.89). Dofetilide was effective in converting atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. After one month, 22 of 190 patients with atrial fibrillation at base line (12 percent) had sinus rhythm restored with dofetilide, as compared with only 3 of 201 patients (1 percent) given placebo. Once sinus rhythm was restored, dofetilide was significantly more effective than placebo in maintaining sinus rhythm (hazard ratio for the recurrence of atrial fibrillation, 0.35; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.22 to 0.57; P{\textless}0.001). There were 25 cases of torsade de pointes in the dofetilide group (3.3 percent) as corn pared with none in the placebo group. Conclusions: In patients with congestive heart failure and reduced left ventricular function, dofetilide was effective in converting atrial fibrillation, preventing its recurrence, and reducing the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure. Dofetilide had no effect on mortality.},

abstract = {Impaired left ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is associated with an increased risk of death. Despite recent advances in the management of these patients, sudden death accounts for up to 50{\%} of this mortality, and effective treatment strategies have yet to be identified. Preliminary trials with amiodarone have offered promise that drugs that prolong action potential duration by blocking the potassium channel may be useful in reducing this mortality. The Survival With Oral d-Sotalol (SWORD) trial is a multicenter, multinational study which tests the hypothesis that the class III agent d-sotalol will reduce all-cause mortality in high-risk survivors of AMI. The trial will enroll 6,400 patients with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤40{\%}) and a recent (6 to 42 days) or a remote ({\textgreater}42 days) AMI with overt heart failure (New York Heart Association class II or III). In approximately 500 centers throughout the world, men and women aged ≥18 years will be enrolled and randomized to placebo or d-sotalol (200 mg/day). The minimal follow-up will be 18 months. The trial has a 90{\%} power to detect a 20{\%} reduction in all-cause mortality. The rationale, design, and trial methods are described. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

@article{Hirao1996,
abstract = {Background: Differentiation between ventriculoatrial (VA) conduction over an accessory AV pathway (AP) and the AV node (AVN) may be difficult, especially in patients with a septal AP. Methods and Results: A new pacing method, para-Hisian pacing, was tested in 149 patients with AP and 53 patients without AP who had AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). Ventricular pacing was performed adjacent to the His bundle and proximal right bundle branch (HB-RB), initially at high output to capture both RV and HB-RB. The output was then decreased to lose HB-RB capture. The change in timing and sequence of retrograde atrial activation between HB-RB capture and noncapture was examined. Loss of HB-RB capture without change in stimulus- atrial (S-A) interval or atrial activation sequence indicated exclusive retrograde AP conduction. An increase in S-A interval without change in His bundle-atrial interval or atrial activation sequence indicated exclusive retrograde AVN conduction. A change in atrial activation sequence indicated the presence of both retrograde AP and AVN conduction. Para-Hisian pacing correctly identified retrograde AP conduction in 132 of 147 AP patients, including all septal and right free wall APs. Retrograde AVN conduction masked AP conduction in 9 of 34 patients with a left free wall AP and 6 of 9 patients with the permanent form of junctional reciprocating tachycardia. Para-Hisian pacing correctly excluded AP conduction in all 53 patients with AVNRT. Conclusions: Para-Hisian pacing reliably identifies retrograde conduction over septal and right free wall APs, but AVN conduction may mask APs located far from the pacing site or with a long retrograde conduction time.},

@article{Arruda1998,
abstract = {Introduction: Delta wave morphology correlates with the site of ventricular insertion of accessory AV pathways. Because lesions due to radiofrequency (RF) current are small and well defined, it may allow precise localization of accessory pathways. The purpose of this study was to use RF catheter ablation to develop an ECG algorithm to predict accessory pathway location. Methods and Results: An algorithm was developed by correlating a resting 12-lead ECG with the successful RF ablation site in 135 consecutive patients with a single, anterogradely conducting accessory pathway (Retrospective phase). This algorithm was subsequently tested prospectively in 121 consecutive patients (Prospective phase). The ECG findings included the initial 20 msec of the delta wave in leads I, II, aVF, and V1 [classified as positive (+), negative (-), or isoelectric (±)] and the ratio of R and S wave amplitudes in leads III and V1 (classified as R ≤ S or R {\textless} S). When tested prospectively, the ECG algorithm accurately localized the accessory pathway to 1 of 10 sites around the tricuspid and mitral annuli or at subepicardial locations within the venous system of the heart. Overall sensitivity was 90{\%} and specificity was 99{\%}. The algorithm was particularly useful in correctly localizing anteroseptal (sensitivity 75{\%}, specificity 99{\%}), and mid-septal (sensitivity 100{\%}, specificity 98{\%}) accessory pathways as well as pathways requiring ablation from within ventricular venous branches or anomalies of the coronary sinus (sensitivity 100{\%}, specificity 100{\%}). Conclusion: A simple ECG algorithm identifies accessory pathway ablation site in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. A truly negative delta wave in lead II predicts ablation within the coronary venous system.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Mortality and morbidity are higher among patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure than among those with heart failure alone. Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation has been proposed as a means of improving outcomes among patients with heart failure who are otherwise receiving appropriate treatment. METHODS We randomly assigned patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation who did not have a response to antiarrhythmic drugs, had unacceptable side effects, or were unwilling to take these drugs to undergo either catheter ablation (179 patients) or medical therapy (rate or rhythm control) (184 patients) for atrial fibrillation in addition to guidelines-based therapy for heart failure. All the patients had New York Heart Association class II, III, or IV heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35{\%} or less, and an implanted defibrillator. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause or hospitalization for worsening heart failure. RESULTS After a median follow-up of 37.8 months, the primary composite end point occurred in significantly fewer patients in the ablation group than in the medicaltherapy group (51 patients [28.5{\%}] vs. 82 patients [44.6{\%}]; hazard ratio, 0.62; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.87; P = 0.007). Significantly fewer patients in the ablation group died from any cause (24 [13.4{\%}] vs. 46 [25.0{\%}]; hazard ratio, 0.53; 95{\%} CI, 0.32 to 0.86; P = 0.01), were hospitalized for worsening heart failure (37 [20.7{\%}] vs. 66 [35.9{\%}]; hazard ratio, 0.56; 95{\%} CI, 0.37 to 0.83; P = 0.004), or died from cardiovascular causes (20 [11.2{\%}] vs. 41 [22.3{\%}]; hazard ratio, 0.49; 95{\%} CI, 0.29 to 0.84; P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure was associated with a significantly lower rate of a composite end point of death from any cause or hospitalization for worsening heart failure than was medical therapy.
