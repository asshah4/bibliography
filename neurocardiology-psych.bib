abstract = {RATIONALE: Excessive vasoconstriction in response to mental stress may be a potential mechanism by which acute psychological stress leads to adverse cardiac events. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether excessive digital vasoconstriction during acute mental stress predicts adverse cardiovascular outcomes among patients with coronary artery disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Five hundred forty-nine patients with stable coronary artery disease (age 63Â±9, 76{\%} male, 29{\%} black) underwent mental stress testing with a standardized public speaking stressor and followed prospectively for cardiovascular end points. Digital pulse wave amplitude was continuously measured using peripheral artery tonometry (PAT, Itamar Inc). Stress/rest PAT ratio (sPAT) of pulse wave amplitude during mental stress/baseline was calculated and dichotomized by the median value into low and high sPAT ratio groups. Upon 3-year follow-up, Fine and Gray's subdistribution hazard ratios were used to examine the association between sPAT ratio and the composite end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, revascularization, and hospitalization for heart failure. The median sPAT ratio was 0.68 (interquartile range, 0.48-0.88), indicating 32{\%} vasoconstriction with mental stress. Men were more likely to have low sPAT ratio than women (odds ratio, 1.79; P=0.007) while those on $\beta$-blockers were less likely to have low sPAT ratio (odds ratio, 0.52; P=0.003). After adjusting for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors, medications, and rate-pressure product change during mental stress, those with low sPAT ratio were at significantly higher risk of adverse outcomes (subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.77 [95{\%} CI, 1.12-2.80]). CONCLUSIONS: Greater peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress, denoted by a low sPAT ratio, is associated with a higher risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES After a previous report demonstrated blunted heart rate (HR) reactivity in association with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) [Voellmin, A., Winzeler, K., Hug, E., Wilhelm, F. H., Schaefer, V., Gaab, J., {\ldots} Bader, K. (2015). Blunted endocrine and cardiovascular reactivity in young healthy women reporting a history of childhood adversity. Psychoneuroendocrinology, 51, 58-67. doi: 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.09.008 ], the present analysis aimed at clarifying the role of the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system in this relationship. DESIGN AND METHODS One hundred eighteen healthy young women provided data on ACEs and underwent psychosocial stress testing. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA, quantified by high-frequency HR variability) were assessed as measures of sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiovascular activity, respectively. A mediation model was calculated to test the indirect effects of ACEs on HR via SBP and RSA. RESULTS The effect of ACEs on HR reactivity was mediated by SBP reactivity but not by RSA reactivity. ACEs were associated with reduced SBP at rest. CONCLUSIONS ACEs were associated with down-regulation in a measure of sympathetic but no alteration in a measure of parasympathetic cardiovascular stress reactivity in adulthood. Future research will need to clarify whether this indicates risk or resilience.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Low heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of cardiac autonomic dysfunction, has been associated with major risk factors of cognitive impairment. Yet, the direct association of HRV with cognitive function remains relatively unexplored, particularly in midlife. METHODS In 2005, 2 measures of short-term HRV, the SD of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), were calculated for participants of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study, and then categorized into quartiles. Five years later, 3 cognitive tests were administered for verbal memory ("Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test", RAVLT, range 0-15), processing speed ("Digit Symbol Substitution Test", DSST, range 0-133), and executive function ("Stroop interference"). RESULTS Two thousand one hundred and eighteen participants (57.7{\%} female, 42.2{\%} Black) with a mean baseline age of 45.3 years were included in this analysis. In demographic-adjusted models, compared to participants with quartile 1 SDNN (lowest quartile), participants in the upper quartiles of SDNN scored better on the DSST (quartile 4: $\beta$ = 1.83 points better, P = 0.03; and quartile 3: $\beta$ = 1.95 points better, P = 0.03) and on the stroop (quartile 3: $\beta$ = 1.19 points better, P {\textless} 0.05; and quartile2: $\beta$ = 1.44 points better, P = 0.02). After adjusting for behavioral and cardiovascular risk factors, higher quartile SDNN remained significantly associated with better stroop score (quartile 3: $\beta$ = 1.21 points better, P = 0.04; and quartile 2: $\beta$ = 1.72 points better, P {\textless} 0.01) but not with DSST. There was no association between quartile of RMSSD and cognitive function, from fully adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that higher quartile SDDN is associated with better executive function in midlife, above, and beyond cardiovascular risk factors.},

abstract = {Background: Depression is associated with an increased risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation, proinflammatory processes, and procoagulant processes have been suggested as possible explanations. Methods: Heart rate variability (HRV), an indicator of cardiac autonomic regulation, and markers of inflammation [C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$)] and coagulation (fibrinogen) were assessed in 44 depressed patients with CHD. Results: Moderate, negative correlations were found between fibrinogen and four measures of HRV. IL-6 also negatively correlated with one measure of HRV (total power) and was marginally related to two others (very low frequency and low frequency power). Neither CRP nor TNF-$\alpha$ was significantly related to any measure of HRV. Conclusions: The finding that fibrinogen and IL-6 are moderately related to HRV suggests a link between these factors in depressed CHD patients. The relationship between ANS function and inflammatory and coagulant processes should be investigated in larger mechanistic studies of depression and cardiac morbidity and mortality. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Background: Studies have linked depression to sudden death and serious cardiovascular events in patients with preexisting cardiac illness. Recent studies have shown decreased vagal function in cardiac patients with depression and depressed patients without cardiac illness. Methods: We compared 20-hour, sleeping, and awake heart period variability measures using spectral analysis, fractal dimension, and symbolic dynamics in two patient groups with major depression and ischemic heart disease (mean age 59-60 years) before and after 6 weeks of paroxetine or nortriptyline treatment. Results: Spectral measures showed decreases in awake and sleeping total power (TP: 0.0-0.5 Hz), ultra low frequency power (ULF: 0-0.0033 Hz), very low frequency power (VLF: 0.0033-0.04 Hz), and low-frequency power (LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz) for nortriptyline condition and a decrease in high-frequency power (HF: 0.15-0.5 Hz) for the awake condition in patients who received nortriptyline. A measure of nonlinear complexity, WC-100, significantly increased after paroxetine during the awake condition. Conclusions: These findings suggest that nortriptyline has stronger vagolytic effects on cardiac autonomic function compared with paroxetine, which is in agreement with previous clinical and preclinical reports. Paroxetine may have some cardio-protective effects, especially in cardiac patients. {\textcopyright} 2002 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {Context: Depression and low perceived social support (LPSS) after myocardial infarction (MI) are associated with higher morbidity and mortality, but little is known about whether this excess risk can be reduced through treatment. Objective: To determine whether mortality and recurrent infarction are reduced by treatment of depression and LPSS with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), supplemented with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant when indicated, in patients enrolled within 28 days after MI. Design, Setting, and Patients: Randomized clinical trial conducted from October 1996 to April 2001 in 2481 MI patients (1084 women, 1397 men) enrolled from 8 clinical centers. Major or minor depression was diagnosed by modified Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria and severity by the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD); LPSS was determined by the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease Patients (ENRICHD) Social Support Instrument (ESSI). Random allocation was to usual medical care or CBT-based psychosocial intervention. Intervention: Cognitive behavior therapy was initiated at a median of 17 days after the index MI for a median of 11 individual sessions throughout 6 months, plus group therapy when feasible, with SSRIs for patients scoring higher than 24 on the HRSD or having a less than 50{\%} reduction in Beck Depression Inventory scores after 5 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: Composite primary end point of death or recurrent MI; secondary outcomes included change in HRSD (for depression) or ESSI scores (for LPSS) at 6 months. Results: Improvement in psychosocial outcomes at 6 months favored treatment: mean (SD) change in HRSD score, -10.1 (7.8) in the depression and psychosocial intervention group vs -8.4 (7.7) in the depression and usual care group (P{\textless}.001); mean (SD) change in ESSI score, 5.1 (5.9) in the LPSS and psychosocial intervention group vs 3.4 (6.0) in the LPSS and usual care group (P{\textless}.001). After an average follow-up of 29 months, there was no significant difference in event-free survival between usual care (75.9{\%}) and psychosocial intervention (75.8{\%}). There were also no differences in survival between the psychosocial intervention and usual care arms in any of the 3 psychosocial risk groups (depression, LPSS, and depression and LPSS patients). Conclusions: The intervention did not increase event-free survival. The intervention improved depression and social isolation, although the relative improvement in the psychosocial intervention group compared with the usual care group was less than expected due to substantial improvement in usual care patients.},

abstract = {Objectives Although there is substantial evidence that psychological factors play an important role in the onset and course of cardiovascular disease (CVD), less is known about their combined effect and the pathways by which they affect cardiovascular health. The present work aimed to prospectively explore the effects of depression and anxiety on the 10-year CVD incidence, in relation to other lifestyle determinants, as linking factors in the context of the ATTICA study. Study design/Main outcome measures: The ATTICA study is a population-based, health and nutrition prospective cohort study (2002â2012), during which 853 middle-aged participants without a history of CVD [453 men (aged 45 Â± 13 years) and 400 women (aged 44 Â± 18 years)], underwent psychological evaluations at enrollment. The latent trait of depression and anxiety combined measure was estimated and referred as âPsychological distressâ; path analysis was applied to describe the relationships among the different factors. Results âPsychological distressâ was positively associated with the 10-year CVD incidence (adjusted OR per 10 units: 1.4, 95{\%} CI: 1.1, 1.7). Three linking pathways were revealed: sedentariness, inflammation and metabolic syndrome. Moreover, âPsychological distressâ mediated the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and CVD, with participants of low SES scoring higher on the psychological measure (adjusted linear regression coefficient b: â7.1, 95{\%} CI: â9.7, â4.5). Conclusions Lifestyle and clinical factors seem to link psychological distress with CVD development. Joint psychological assessments should be considered for inclusion in CVD preventive strategies, which should incorporate interventions for interrupting the linking pathways.},

abstract = {Objective: To examine the association between cumulative life course and adult socioeconomic status (SES) and adult levels of inflammatory risk markers (fibrinogen, white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), von Willebrand factor (vWF) and an overall inflammatory score). Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: 12 681 white and African-American participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and two ancillary studies. Methods: Participants provided information on SES and place of residence in childhood and young (30-40 years) and mature (45+) adulthood. Residences were linked to census data for neighbourhood SES information. Multiple imputation (MI) was used for missing data. Linear regression and adjusted geometric means were used to estimate the effects of SES on inflammatory risk marker levels. Results: Graded, statistically significant associations were observed between greater cumulative life-course exposure to low education and social class and elevated levels of fibrinogen and WBC among white participants. Stronger graded, statistically significant associations were observed between low adult education, social class and neighbourhood SES and elevated inflammatory levels. Associations were weaker and less consistent in African-Americans. Covariate adjustment attenuated results but many associations remained strong. Conclusions: Our results suggest that cumulative exposure to adverse SES conditions across the life course and low adult SES are associated with an elevated systemic inflammatory burden in adulthood. Chronic systemic inflammation may be one pathway linking low life-course SES and elevated cardiovascular disease risk.},

abstract = {Objectives: This study examined whether blood pressure (BP) and heart rate responses to acute mental stress were associated with mortality in patients with heart failure (HF). Background: HF is characterized by reduced contractility and impaired BP reactivity. Compared to exercise-induced physiological changes, the effects of mental stress on BP and heart rate in HF are not well understood. Methods: Patients with systolic HF (N= 100, 26{\%} female, mean 65 Â± 12 years of age) underwent a structured public speech task, during which BP and heart rate were recorded. Stress-induced BP and heart rate reactivity were categorized as high ({\textgreater}75{\%}), intermediate (25{\%} to 75{\%}), or low ({\textless}25{\%}). Cox proportional hazards regressions were used to examine the predictive value of cardiovascular stress responses for mortality (median follow-up= 48.5 months), adjusting for age, implanted devices, and baseline BP and heart rate levels. Results: At follow-up, 31 patients had died (31{\%}). Mortality rates were 2 times higher (hazard ratio [HR]:2.04; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 1.15 to 3.60; p= 0.014) among patients with the lowest diastolic BP responses (mean=-2.4 Â± 5.4mmHg) to mental stress than among those patients with an intermediate diastolic BP response (mean= 7.3 Â± 2.5mmHg), adjusting for covariates. High diastolic BP reactivity (mean= 16.3 Â± 3.4 mmHg) was not related to mortality (HR: 0.95; 95{\%} CI: 0.55 to 1.66). Systolic BP responses showed a similar but nonsignificant association. Multivariate analyses showed that a high heart rate response ({\textgreater}6.3 beats/min) to acute mental stress was associated with a reduced mortality risk (HR: 0.40; 95{\%} CI: 0.16 to 1.00; p= 0.051) compared to patients with intermediate responses. Conclusions: Low diastolic BP reactivity to mental stress is independently associated with all-cause mortality inpatients with HF. Larger studies need to replicate this finding and examine the role of psychosocial variables.},

abstract = {Background: Mental stressâinduced myocardial ischemia is a frequent phenomenon in patients with coronary artery disease. Women with coronary artery disease tend to have more mental stressâinduced myocardial ischemia and more chest pain/anginal symptoms than men, but whether the association between mental stressâinduced myocardial ischemia and angina burden differs in women and men is unknown. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with experimental manipulation of 950 individuals with stable coronary artery disease. Chest pain/angina frequency in the previous 4 weeks was assessed with the Seattle Angina Questionnaire's angina-frequency subscale. Mental stressâinduced myocardial ischemia was assessed with myocardial perfusion imaging during mental stress (standardized public speaking task). Presence of mental stressâinduced myocardial ischemia was based on expert readers and established criteria. A conventional (exercise or pharmacologic) stress test was used as a control condition. Results: Overall, 338 individuals (37{\%}) reported angina; 112 (12{\%}) developed mental stressâinduced myocardial ischemia, and 256 (29{\%}) developed conventional stress ischemia. Women who reported angina had almost double the probability to develop mental stressâinduced myocardial ischemia (19{\%} vs 10{\%}, adjusted prevalence rate ratio, 1.90; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.04-3.46), whereas there was no such difference in men (11{\%} vs 11{\%}, adjusted prevalence rate ratio, 1.09; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.66-1.82). No association was found between angina symptoms and conventional stress ischemia for women or men. Results for ischemia as a continuous variable were similar. Conclusions: In women, but not in men, anginal symptoms may be a marker of vulnerability toward ischemia induced by psychologic stress. These results highlight the psychosocial origins of angina in women and may have important implications for the management and prognosis of women with angina.},

abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and depression are common. Patients with CVD have more depression than the general population. Persons with depression are more likely to eventually develop CVD and also have a higher mortality rate than the general population. Patients with CVD, who are also depressed, have a worse outcome than those patients who are not depressed. There is a graded relationship: the more severe the depression, the higher the subsequent risk of mortality and other cardiovascular events. It is possible that depression is only a marker for more severe CVD which so far cannot be detected using our currently available investigations. However, given the increased prevalence of depression in patients with CVD, a causal relationship with either CVD causing more depression or depression causing more CVD and a worse prognosis for CVD is probable. There are many possible pathogenetic mechanisms that have been described, which are plausible and that might well be important. However, whether or not there is a causal relationship, depression is the main driver of quality of life and requires prevention, detection, and management in its own right. Depression after an acute cardiac event is commonly an adjustment disorder than can improve spontaneously with comprehensive cardiac management. Additional management strategies for depressed cardiac patients include cardiac rehabilitation and exercise programmes, general support, cognitive behavioural therapy, antidepressant medication, combined approaches, and probably disease management programmes. {\textcopyright} The Author 2013.},

In Study 1 three items selected for high correlations with the total score (SSQ3) were administered to 182 university students together with several personality measures. SSQ3 had acceptable test-retest reliability and correlations with personality variables similar to those of the SSQ. Internal reliability was marginal although acceptable for an instrument with so few items. Study 2 employed three sets of data in developing a six-item instrument (SSQ6). The SSQ6 had high internal reliability and correlated highly with the SSQ and similarly to it with personality variables. The research findings accompanying the development of the short form social support measure suggest that perceived social support in adults may be a reflection of early attachment experience. {\textcopyright} 1987, Sage Publications.

abstract = {Notes that depression in patients with cardiovascular disease is a significant risk factor for developing symptomatic and fatal ischemic heart disease. Moreover, depressed patients have a higher than expected rate of sudden cardiovascular death. Therefore, appropriate treatment of patients with depression and cardiovascular disease cannot be restricted to considerations of either depression or cardiovascular disease in isolation. The tricyclic antidepressants have various effects on the cardiovascular system, including Type IA antiarrhythmic activity that has been associated with an increased risk of mortality in post-myocardial infarction patients. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are not associated with adverse cardiac effects. On the basis of this favorable cardiovascular profile, the SSRIs should therefore be the preferred choice for the treatment of most patients with comorbid depression and cardiovascular disease. Investigation of putative pathophysiologic mechanisms linking depression and cardiovascular mortality, such as the role of platelet activation, will form the basis for further investigation of antidepressant treatments in order to establish if the antidepressants have a beneficial effect on the prognosis of cardiovascular diseases.

abstract = {Both social isolation and loneliness are associated with increased mortality, but it is uncertain whether their effects are independent or whether loneliness represents the emotional pathway through which social isolation impairs health. We therefore assessed the extent to which the association between social isolation and mortality is mediated by loneliness. We assessed social isolation in terms of contact with family and friends and participation in civic organizations in 6,500 men and women aged 52 and older who took part in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing in 2004-2005. A standard questionnaire measure of loneliness was administered also. We monitored all-cause mortality up to March 2012 (mean follow-up 7.25 y) and analyzed results using Cox proportional hazards regression. We found that mortality was higher among more socially isolated and more lonely participants. However, after adjusting statistically for demographic factors and baseline health, social isolation remained significantly associated with mortality (hazard ratio 1.26, 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.08-1.48 for the top quintile of isolation), but loneliness did not (hazard ratio 0.92, 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.78-1.09). The association of social isolation with mortality was unchanged when loneliness was included in the model. Both social isolation and loneliness were associated with increased mortality. However, the effect of loneliness was not independent of demographic characteristics or health problems and did not contribute to the risk associated with social isolation. Although both isolation and loneliness impair quality of life and well-being, efforts to reduce isolation are likely to be more relevant to mortality.},

abstract = {Objective: This study examines how the social environment is related to allostatic load (AL), a multisystem index of biological risk. Method: A national sample of adults (N = 949) aged 34-84 rated their relationships with spouse, family, and friends at 2 time points 10 years apart. At the second time point, participants completed a biological protocol in which indices of autonomic, hypothalamicpituitary- adrenal axis, cardiovascular, inflammatory, and metabolic function were obtained and used to create an AL summary score. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the associations among 3 aspects of social relationships-social support, social negativity, and frequency of social contact-and AL. Results: Higher levels of spouse negativity, family negativity, friend contact, and network level contact were each associated with higher AL, and higher levels of spouse support were associated with lower AL, independent of age, sociodemographic factors, and health covariates. Tests for age interactions suggested that friend support and network support were each associated with higher AL among older adults, but at younger ages there appeared to be no association between friend support and AL and a negative association between network support and AL. For network negativity, there was a marginal interaction such that network negativity was associated with higher AL among younger adults but there was no association among older adults. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that structural and functional aspects of the social environment are associated with AL, and extend previous work by demonstrating that these associations vary based on the type of relationship assessed and by age.},

Methods: Heart rate variability was measured during 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring in 40 medically stable out-patients with documented coronary heart disease meeting current diagnostic criteria for major depression, and 32 nondepressed, but otherwise comparable, patients. Patients discontinued $\beta$-blockers and antidepressant medications at the time of study. Depressed patients were classified as mildly (n = 21) or moderately-to-severely depressed (n = 19) on the basis of Beck Depression Inventory scores. Results: There were no significant differences among the groups in age, gender, blood pressure, history of myocardial infarction, diabetes, or smoking. Heart rates were higher and nearly all indices of heart rate variability were significantly reduced in the moderately-to-severely versus the nondepressed group. Heart rates were also higher and mean values for heart rate variability lower in the mildly depressed group compared with the nondepressed group, but these differences did not attain statistical significance. Conclusion: The association of moderate to severe depression with reduced heart rate variability in patients with stable coronary heart disease may reflect altered cardiac autonomic modulation and may explain their increased risk for mortality.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression is associated with an increased risk for mortality after acute myocardial infarction (MI). The purpose of this study was to determine whether low heart rate variability (HRV) mediates the effect of depression on mortality. METHODS: Twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were obtained from 311 depressed patients with a recent acute MI who were enrolled in the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease (ENRICHD) clinical trial and from 367 nondepressed patients who met the ENRICHD medical inclusion criteria. Standard HRV indexes were extracted from the recordings. RESULTS: The log of very low-frequency (LnVLF) power, an index of HRV derived from power spectral analysis of the electrocardiogram signal (0.0033-0.04 Hz [in milliseconds squared]), was lower in the depressed than in the nondepressed patients (P{\textless}.001). There were 47 deaths (6.1{\%}) during a 30-month follow-up. After adjusting for potential confounders, the depressed patients remained at higher risk for all-cause mortality compared with the nondepressed patients (hazard ratio, 2.8; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.4-5.4; P{\textless}.003). When LnVLF power was entered into the model, the hazard ratio for depression dropped to 2.1 (95{\%} CI, 1.1-4.2; P = .03). The proportion of the risk for depression attributable to LnVLF power was 0.27 (95{\%} CI, 0.23-0.31; P{\textless}.001). CONCLUSIONS: Low HRV partially mediates the effect of depression on survival after acute MI. This finding helps to clarify the physiological mechanisms underlying depression's role as a risk factor for mortality in patients with coronary heart disease. It also raises the possibility that treatments that improve both depression and HRV might also improve survival in these patients.},

To date, the pathophysiological mechanisms whereby panic leads to attenuated HRV are not fully elu- cidated.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Major depression is a common problem in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and is associated with an increased risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality. It is not known whether treating depression will improve medical prognosis in patients with CHD. Depression is also associated with elevated heart rate and reduced heart rate variability (HRV), which are known risk factors for cardiac morbidity and mortality that may explain the increased risk associated with depression. The purpose of this study was to determine whether treatment for depression with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is associated with decreased heart rate or increased HRV. METHODS Thirty depressed patients with stable CHD, classified as either mildly or moderately to severely depressed, received up to 16 sessions of CBT. The 24-hour heart rate and HRV were measured in these patients and in 22 medically comparable nondepressed controls before and after treatment of the depressed patients. RESULTS Average heart rate and daytime rMSSD (reflecting mostly parasympathetic activity) improved significantly in the severely depressed patients, but remained unchanged in the mildly depressed and the control patients. However, only rMSSD improved to a level comparable to the control patients. None of the remaining indices of HRV showed improvement. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that treating depression with CBT may reduce heart rate and increase short-term HRV. Thus, CBT may have a beneficial effect on a risk factor for mortality in depressed patients with coronary heart disease. A randomized, controlled study is needed to confirm these findings.},

This population-based cohort study aimed to determine the association between depression of varying severity and risk for CVD and to study the effect of concomitant anxious distress on this association. METHODS We utilized data from a longitudinal cohort study of mental health, work and relations among adults (20-64 years), with a total of 10,443 individuals. Depression and anxious distress were assessed using psychiatric rating scales and defined according to DSM-5. Outcomes were register-based and self-reported cardiovascular diseases. FINDINGS Overall increased odds ratios of 1.5 to 2.6 were seen for the different severity levels of depression, with the highest adjusted OR for moderate depression (OR 2.1 (95{\%} CI 1.3, 3.5). Similar odds ratios were seen for sub-groups of CVD: ischemic/hypertensive heart disease and stroke, 2.4 (95{\%} CI 1.4, 3.9) and OR 2.1 (95{\%}CI 1.2, 3.8) respectively. Depression with anxious distress as a specifier of severity showed OR of 2.1 (95{\%} CI 1.5, 2.9) for CVD. CONCLUSION This study found that severity level of depression seems to be of significance for increased risk of CVD among depressed persons, although not in a dose-response manner which might be obscured due to treatment of depression. Further, we found a higher risk of CVD among depressed individuals with symptoms of anxious distress.},

All underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring after hospital discharge. In univariate analyses, 4 indices of HRV were significantly lower in patients with depression than in patients without depression. Variables associated with HRV were then compared between patients with and without depression, and potential confounds were identified. These variables (age, sex, diabetes, and present cigarette smoking) were entered into an analysis of covariance model, followed by depression status. In the final model, all but one HRV index (high-frequency power) remained significantly lower in patients with depression than in patients without depression. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that greater autonomic dysfunction, as reflected by decreased HRV, is a plausible mechanism linking depression to increased cardiac mortality in post-MI patients.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine prospectively early-age heart disease (HD) among a national random sample of 4328 male Vietnam veterans, who did not have HD at baseline in 1985. Studies have suggested that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may result in cardiovascular disease. However, many past studies had important methodological limitations to their designs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: Using Cox regressions, we assessed PTSD, age, race, intelligence, family history, obesity, smoking, alcohol abuse, antisocial personality, and depression in predicting HD mortality at follow-up in December 31, 2000. The men were {\textless}65 years old at follow-up.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Using two PTSD measures, a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd Edition (DSM-III) measure (D-PTSD) and one developed by Keane (K-PTSD), we found that among Vietnam theater and era veterans combined (era veterans had no Vietnam service), having PTSD was associated with HD mortality for D-PTSD (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.25, p = .045) and approached significance for K-PTSD (HR = 2.16, p = .066). However, having higher PTSD symptoms on either scale was associated with mortality, with a 5-point increase associated with approximately 20{\%} increase in mortality risk (all p {\textless} .05). Controlling for lifetime depression only slightly altered the results. The effects for theater veterans alone were stronger (D-PTSD: HR = 2.58, p = .025; K-PTSD: HR = 2.73, p = .022). Among theater veterans, controlling for lifetime depression or combat exposure made little difference.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: PTSD was prospectively associated with HD mortality among veterans free of HD at baseline. This study suggests that early-age HD may be an outcome after military service among PTSD-positive veterans.},

abstract = {Mental stress testing has been proposed as a noninvasive tool to evaluate endothelium-dependent coronary vasomotion. In patients with coronary artery disease, mental stress can induce myocardial ischemia. However, even the determinants of the physiological myocardial blood flow (MBF) response to mental stress are poorly understood. Twenty-four individuals (12 males/12 females, mean age 49 +/- 13 yr, range 31-74 yr) with a low likelihood for coronary artery disease were studied. Serum catecholamines, cardiac work, and MBF (measured quantitatively with N-13 ammonia and positron emission tomography) were assessed. During mental stress (arithmetic calculation) MBF increased significantly from 0.70 +/- 0.14 to 0.92 +/- 0.21 ml x min(-1) x g(-1) (P {\textless} 0.01). Mental stress caused significant increases (P {\textless} 0.01) in serum epinephrine (26 +/- 16 vs. 42 +/- 17 pg/ml), norepinephrine (272 +/- 139 vs. 322 +/- 136 pg/ml), and cardiac work [rate-pressure product (RPP) 8,011 +/- 1,884 vs. 10,416 +/- 2,711]. Stress-induced changes in cardiac work were correlated with changes in MBF (r = 0.72; P {\textless} 0.01). Multiple-regression analysis revealed stress-induced changes in the RPP as the only significant (P = 0.0001) predictor for the magnitude of mental stress-induced increases in MBF in healthy individuals. Data from this group of healthy individuals should prove useful to investigate coronary vasomotion in individuals at risk for or with documented coronary artery disease.},

abstract = {Background: The economic burden of depression in the United States-including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, and dysthymia-was estimated at {\$}83.1 billion in 2000. We update these findings using recent data, focusing on MDD alone and accounting for comorbid physical and psychiatric disorders. Method: Using national survey (DSM-IV criteria) and administrative claims data (ICD-9 codes), we estimate the incremental economic burden of individuals with MDD as well as the share of these costs attributable to MDD, with attention to any changes that occurred between 2005 and 2010. Results: The incremental economic burden of individuals with MDD increased by 21.5{\%} (from {\$}173.2 billion to {\$}210.5 billion, inflation-adjusted dollars). The composition of these costs remained stable, with approximately 45{\%} attributable to direct costs, 5{\%} to suicide-related costs, and 50{\%} to workplace costs. Only 38{\%} of the total costs were due to MDD itself as opposed to comorbid conditions. Conclusions: Comorbid conditions account for the largest portion of the growing economic burden of MDD. Future research should analyze further these comorbidities as well as the relative importance of factors contributing to that growing burden. These include population growth, increase in MDD prevalence, increase in treatment cost per individual with MDD, changes in employment and treatment rates, as well as changes in the composition and quality of MDD treatment services.},

abstract = {Background: Depression is associated with an increased risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation, proinflammatory processes, and procoagulant processes have been suggested as possible explanations. Methods: Heart rate variability (HRV), an indicator of cardiac autonomic regulation, and markers of inflammation [C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$)] and coagulation (fibrinogen) were assessed in 44 depressed patients with CHD. Results: Moderate, negative correlations were found between fibrinogen and four measures of HRV. IL-6 also negatively correlated with one measure of HRV (total power) and was marginally related to two others (very low frequency and low frequency power). Neither CRP nor TNF-$\alpha$ was significantly related to any measure of HRV. Conclusions: The finding that fibrinogen and IL-6 are moderately related to HRV suggests a link between these factors in depressed CHD patients. The relationship between ANS function and inflammatory and coagulant processes should be investigated in larger mechanistic studies of depression and cardiac morbidity and mortality. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Importance: Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and elevated depressive symptoms are at increased risk for recurrent cardiovascular events and mortality, worse quality of life, and higher health care costs. These observational findings prompted multiple scientific panels to advise universal depression screening in survivors of ACS prior to evidence from randomized screening trials. Objective: To determine whether systematically screening for depression in survivors of ACS improves quality of life and depression compared with usual care. Design, Setting, and Participants: A 3-group multisite randomized trial enrolled 1500 patients with ACS from 4 health care systems between November 1, 2013, and March 31, 2017, with follow-up ending July 31, 2018. Patients were eligible if they had been hospitalized for ACS in the previous 2 to 12 months and had no prior history of depression. All analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Interventions: Patients with ACS were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive (1) systematic depression screening using the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire, with notification of primary care clinicians and provision of centralized, patient-preference, stepped depression care for those with positive screening results (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire score â¥10; screen, notify, and treat, n = 499); (2) systematic depression screening, with notification of primary care clinicians for those with positive screening results (screen and notify, n = 501); and (3) usual care (no screening, n = 500). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was change in quality-adjusted life-years. The secondary outcome was depression-free days. Adverse effects and mortality were assessed by patient interview and hospital records. Results: A total of 1500 patients (424 women and 1076 men; mean [SD] age, 65.9 [11.5] years) were randomized in the 18-month trial. Only 71 of 1000 eligible survivors of ACS (7.1{\%}) had elevated 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire scores indicating depressive symptoms at screening. There were no differences in mean (SD) change in quality-adjusted life-years (screen, notify and treat, -0.06 [0.20]; screen and notify, -0.06 [0.20]; no screen, -0.06 [0.18]; P =.98) or cumulative mean (SD) depression-free days (screen, notify and treat, 343.1 [179.0] days; screen and notify, 351.3 [175.0] days; no screen, 339.0 [176.6] days; P =.63). Harms including death, bleeding, or sleep difficulties did not differ among groups. Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with ACS without a history of depression, systematic depression screening with or without providing depression treatment did not alter quality-adjusted life-years, depression-free days, or harms.

abstract = {High cardiac vagal control (as measured by respiratory sinus arrhythmia; RSA) is associated with lower depression. Recent theories argue that people's responsiveness to social resources is a key mechanism in this association. This argument implies two hypotheses: first, high RSA should be related to decreased depressive symptoms only when social resources (social support) are available; second, utilization of available social resources (social engagement) should serve as a mechanism for the positive effects of RSA. To test these hypotheses, we measured RSA in 131 adults. Participants reported their social support, social engagement, and depressive symptoms. Six months later, they again reported their depressive symptoms. Participants with higher RSA reported fewer depressive symptoms six months later, but only under conditions of high social support. The interaction between RSA and social support in predicting depressive symptoms was fully mediated by social engagement. These findings provide crucial support for the idea that cardiac vagal control contributes to decreased depressive symptoms via social processes. Implications for biological sensitivity to context and differential susceptibility theories as well as for the prevention and treatment of depression are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Background Heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of cardiac autonomic nervous system functioning, has emerged as a physiological indicator for emotional regulation and psychological well-being. HRV is understudied in the context of depression and anxiety in young people (10â24 years old). Main objectives: (1) describe the nature and breadth of reviewed studies; and (2) synthesize main findings in the context of clinical and non-clinical populations of young people with depression and/or anxiety. Methods The Arksey and O'Malley methodology was utilized for this scoping review. CINHAL, EMBASE, Medline, PsychInfo, Scopus, Web of Science, as well as grey literature, were searched. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full papers for inclusion. A total of 20 citations were included in the final review (19 citations peer-reviewed journal articles, 1 journal abstract). Numerical and thematic analysis was used to summarize study findings. Results In clinical populations of either depression or anxiety, HRV was lower compared to controls. In non-clinical populations of either depression or anxiety, HRV was found to be lower in those who reported more depression or anxiety symptoms. Limitations The quality of the reviewed articles was not assessed which limits the ability to generate conclusions regarding study findings. Conclusion Changes in HRV were found across the spectrum of clinical and non-clinical populations of young people with depression or anxiety. Neurophysiological research on depression and anxiety in young people can act as a first step to understanding how physiological flexibility (i.e. HRV) is related to psychological flexibility (i.e. adaptive or maladaptive responses to life events).},

abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with increased risk of multiple medical problems including myocardial infarction. However, a direct link between PTSD and atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) has not been made. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is an excellent method to detect atherosclerosis. This study investigated the association of PTSD to atherosclerotic CAD and mortality. Six hundred thirty-seven veterans without known CAD (61 Â± 9 years of age, 12.2{\%} women) underwent CAC scanning for clinical indications and their psychological health status (PTSD vs non-PTSD) was evaluated. In subjects with PTSD, CAC was more prevalent than in the non-PTSD cohort (76.1{\%} vs 59{\%}, p = 0.001) and their CAC scores were significantly higher in each Framingham risk score category compared to the non-PTSD group. Multivariable generalized linear regression analysis identified PTSD as an independent predictor of presence and extent of atherosclerotic CAD (p {\textless}0.01). During a mean follow-up of 42 months, the death rate was higher in the PTSD compared to the non-PTSD group (15, 17.1{\%}, vs 57, 10.4{\%}, p = 0.003). Multivariable survival regression analyses revealed a significant linkage between PTSD and mortality and between CAC and mortality. After adjustment for risk factors, relative risk (RR) of death was 1.48 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.03 to 2.91, p = 0.01) in subjects with PTSD and CAC score {\textgreater}0 compared to subjects without PTSD and CAC score equal to 0. With a CAC score equal to 0, risk of death was not different between subjects with and without PTSD (RR 1.04, 95{\%} CI 0.67 to 6.82, p = 0.4). Risk of death in each CAC category was higher in subjects with PTSD compared to matched subjects without PTSD (RRs 1.23 for CAC scores 1 to 100, 1.51 for CAC scores 101 to 400, and 1.81 for CAC scores {\textless}400, p {\textless}0.05 for all comparisons). In conclusion, PTSD is associated with presence and severity of coronary atherosclerosis and predicts mortality independent of age, gender, and conventional risk factors. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is a common phenomenon in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and an emerging prognostic factor. Mental stress ischemia is correlated with ambulatory ischemia. However, whether it is related to angina symptoms during daily life has not been examined. METHODS: We assessed angina frequency (past month) in 98 post-myocardial infarction (MI) subjects (age 18-60 years) using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. Patients underwent [(99m)Tc]sestamibi SPECT perfusion imaging at rest, after mental stress, and after exercise/pharmacological stress. Summed scores of perfusion abnormalities were obtained by observer-independent software. A summed difference score (SDS), the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. RESULTS: The mean age was 50 years, 50{\%} were female and 60{\%} were non-white. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, CAD severity, depressive, anger, and anxiety symptoms, each 1-point increase in mental stress-SDS was associated with 1.73-unit increase in the angina frequency score (95{\%} CI: 0.09-3.37) and 17{\%} higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.17, 95{\%} CI: 1.00-1.38). Depressive symptoms were associated with 12{\%} higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.12, 95{\%} CI: 1.03-1.21). In contrast, exercise/pharmacological stress-induced SDS was not associated with angina frequency. CONCLUSION: Among young and middle-aged post-MI patients, myocardial ischemia induced by mental stress in the lab, but not by exercise/pharmacological stress, is associated with higher frequency of retrospectively reported angina during the day. Psychosocial stressors related to mental stress ischemia may be important contributory factor to daily angina.},

Significant group by trial interaction effects was found for systolic blood pressure following administration of verbal fluency [F(1,54) = 5.86, p {\textless} 0.05] and nonverbal fluency stressors [F(1,54) = 13.68, p {\textless} .001].

The corresponding results are discussed in terms of functional cerebral systems and potential implications for physiological models of anger.

abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and depression are common. Patients with CVD have more depression than the general population. Persons with depression are more likely to eventually develop CVD and also have a higher mortality rate than the general population. Patients with CVD, who are also depressed, have a worse outcome than those patients who are not depressed. There is a graded relationship: the more severe the depression, the higher the subsequent risk of mortality and other cardiovascular events. It is possible that depression is only a marker for more severe CVD which so far cannot be detected using our currently available investigations. However, given the increased prevalence of depression in patients with CVD, a causal relationship with either CVD causing more depression or depression causing more CVD and a worse prognosis for CVD is probable. There are many possible pathogenetic mechanisms that have been described, which are plausible and that might well be important. However, whether or not there is a causal relationship, depression is the main driver of quality of life and requires prevention, detection, and management in its own right. Depression after an acute cardiac event is commonly an adjustment disorder than can improve spontaneously with comprehensive cardiac management. Additional management strategies for depressed cardiac patients include cardiac rehabilitation and exercise programmes, general support, cognitive behavioural therapy, antidepressant medication, combined approaches, and probably disease management programmes. {\textcopyright} The Author 2013.},

Elevated aggressiveness predicts high-risk to suicide in humans and despite the difficulty in reproducing a complex human suicidal behavior in rodents, aggressive behavior is a well reproducible behavioral trait of suicide. PTSD animal models are based on a peculiar phenotype, including exaggerated fear memory, anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors associated with neurochemical dysregulations in emotional brain circuitry. The endocannabinoid and the neurosteroid systems regulate emotions and stress responses, and recent evidence shows these two systems are interrelated and critically compromised in neuropsychiatric disorders. For instance, levels of the neurosteroid, allopregnanolone, as well as those of the endocannabinoids, anandamide and its congener, palmitoylethanolamide are decreased in PTSD. Similarly, the endocannabinoid system and neurosteroid biosynthesis are altered in suicidal individuals. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the only FDA-approved treatments for PTSD and depression, fail to help half of the treatment-seeking patients. This highlights the need for developing biomarker-based efficient therapies. One promising hypothesis points to stimulation of allopregnanolone biosynthesis as a valid end-point to predict treatment response in PTSD patients. This review highlights running findings on the role of the endocannabinoid and neurosteroid systems in PTSD and suicidal behavior both in a preclinical and clinical perspective. A specific focus is given to predictive PTSD/suicide animal models. Ultimately, we discuss the idea that disruption of neurosteroid and endocannabinoid biosynthesis may offer novel promising biomarker candidates to develop new treatments for PTSD and, perhaps, suicidal behavior.},

We sought to examine whether mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI), but not exercise-induced ischemia, is more common in young women with previous myocardial infarction (MI) than in men.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We studied 98 post-MI patients (49 women and 49 men) aged 38 to 60 years. Women and men were matched for age, MI type, and months since MI. Patients underwent technetium-99m sestamibi perfusion imaging at rest, after mental stress, and after exercise/pharmacological stress. Perfusion defect scores were obtained with observer-independent software. A summed difference score (SDS), the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify ischemia under both stress conditions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Women 50 years or younger, but not older women, showed a more adverse psychosocial profile than did age-matched men but did not differ for conventional risk factors and tended to have less angiographic coronary artery disease. Compared with age-matched men, women 50 years or younger exhibited a higher SDS with mental stress (3.1 versus 1.5, p = .029) and had twice the rate of MSIMI (SDS â¥ 3; 52{\%} versus 25{\%}), whereas ischemia with physical stress did not differ (36{\%} versus 25{\%}). In older patients, there were no sex differences in MSIMI. The higher prevalence of MSIMI in young women persisted when adjusting for sociodemographic and life-style factors, coronary artery disease severity, and depression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: MSIMI post-MI is more common in women 50 years or younger compared with age-matched men. These sex differences are not observed in post-MI patients who are older than 50 years.},

abstract = {Objectives Although there is substantial evidence that psychological factors play an important role in the onset and course of cardiovascular disease (CVD), less is known about their combined effect and the pathways by which they affect cardiovascular health. The present work aimed to prospectively explore the effects of depression and anxiety on the 10-year CVD incidence, in relation to other lifestyle determinants, as linking factors in the context of the ATTICA study. Study design/Main outcome measures: The ATTICA study is a population-based, health and nutrition prospective cohort study (2002â2012), during which 853 middle-aged participants without a history of CVD [453 men (aged 45 Â± 13 years) and 400 women (aged 44 Â± 18 years)], underwent psychological evaluations at enrollment. The latent trait of depression and anxiety combined measure was estimated and referred as âPsychological distressâ; path analysis was applied to describe the relationships among the different factors. Results âPsychological distressâ was positively associated with the 10-year CVD incidence (adjusted OR per 10 units: 1.4, 95{\%} CI: 1.1, 1.7). Three linking pathways were revealed: sedentariness, inflammation and metabolic syndrome. Moreover, âPsychological distressâ mediated the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and CVD, with participants of low SES scoring higher on the psychological measure (adjusted linear regression coefficient b: â7.1, 95{\%} CI: â9.7, â4.5). Conclusions Lifestyle and clinical factors seem to link psychological distress with CVD development. Joint psychological assessments should be considered for inclusion in CVD preventive strategies, which should incorporate interventions for interrupting the linking pathways.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies have found that depression is an independent predictor of poor outcome after the onset of clinical coronary artery disease. There are few data concerning depression as a risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine if clinical depression is an independent risk factor for incident coronary artery disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Johns Hopkins Precursors Study is a prospective, observational study of 1190 male medical students who were enrolled between 1948 and 1964 and who continued to be followed up. In medical school and through the follow-up period, information was collected on family history, health behaviors, and clinical depression. Cardiovascular disease end points have been assessed with reviews of annual questionnaires, National Death Index searches, medical records, death certificates, and autopsy reports. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of clinical depression in the medical students at 40 years of follow-up was 12{\%}. Men who developed clinical depression drank more coffee than those who did not but did not differ in terms of baseline blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, smoking status, physical activity, obesity, or family history of coronary artery disease. In multivariate analysis, the men who reported clinical depression were at significantly greater risk for subsequent coronary heart disease (relative risk [RR], 2.12; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.24-3.63) and myocardial infarction (RR, 2.12; 95{\%} CI, 1.11-4.06). The increased risk associated with clinical depression was present even for myocardial infarctions occurring 10 years after the onset of the first depressive episode (RR, 2.1; 95{\%} CI, 1.1-4.0). CONCLUSION: Clinical depression appears to be an independent risk factor for incident coronary artery disease for several decades after the onset of the clinical depression.},

abstract = {Depression increases the risk of cardiac mortality and morbidity in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), but the mechanisms that underlie this association remain unclear. This review considers the evidence for several behavioral and physiological mechanisms that might explain how depression increases the risk for incident coronary disease and for subsequent cardiac morbidity and mortality. The candidate mechanisms include: (1) antidepressant cardiotoxicity; (2) association of depression with cardiac risk factor such as cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and reduced functional capacity; (3) association of depression with greater coronary disease severity; (4) nonadherence to cardiac prevention and treatment regimens; (5) lower heart rate variability (HRV) reflecting altered cardiac autonomic tone; (6) increased platelet aggregation; and (7) inflammatory processes. Despite recent advances in our understanding of these potential mechanisms, further research is needed to determine how depression increases risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The topic of this review has incited perennial debate, because of disagreements over definitions, controversial inferences, and limited availability of relevant measurement tools. The discussion begins appropriately with Cannon's "homeostasis" and his pioneering work in the area. This is followed by mental stress as a scientific idea and the relatively new notions of allostasis and allostatic load. Experimental models of mental stress in rodents and humans are discussed, with particular attention to ethical constraints in humans. Sections follow on sympathoneural responses to mental stress, reactivity of catecholamine systems, clinical pathophysiologic states, and the cardiovascular reactivity hypothesis. Future advancement of the field will require integrative approaches and coordinated efforts between physiologists and psychologists on this interdisciplinary topic.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is frequent in patients with coronary artery disease and is associated with worse prognosis. Young women with a previous myocardial infarction (MI), a group with unexplained higher mortality than men of comparable age, have shown elevated rates of MSIMI, but the mechanisms are unknown. METHODS We studied 306 patients (150 women and 156 men) â¤61 years of age who were hospitalized for MI in the previous 8 months and 112 community controls (58 women and 54 men) frequency matched for sex and age to the patients with MI. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation and microvascular reactivity (reactive hyperemia index) were measured at rest and 30 minutes after mental stress. The digital vasomotor response to mental stress was assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry. Patients received 99mTc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest, with mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) stress. RESULTS The mean age of the sample was 50 years (range, 22-61). In the MI group but not among controls, women had a more adverse socioeconomic and psychosocial profile than men. There were no sex differences in cardiovascular risk factors, and among patients with MI, clinical severity tended to be lower in women. Women in both groups showed a higher peripheral arterial tonometry ratio during mental stress but a lower reactive hyperemia index after mental stress, indicating enhanced microvascular dysfunction after stress. There were no sex differences in flow-mediated dilation changes with mental stress. The rate of MSIMI was twice as high in women as in men (22{\%} versus 11{\%}, P=0.009), and ischemia with conventional stress was similarly elevated (31{\%} versus 16{\%}, P=0.002). Psychosocial and clinical risk factors did not explain sex differences in inducible ischemia. Although vascular responses to mental stress (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio and reactive hyperemia index) also did not explain sex differences in MSIMI, they were predictive of MSIMI in women only. CONCLUSIONS Young women after MI have a 2-fold likelihood of developing MSIMI compared with men and a similar increase in conventional stress ischemia. Microvascular dysfunction and peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress are implicated in MSIMI among women but not among men, perhaps reflecting women's proclivity toward ischemia because of microcirculatory abnormalities.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity. MEASUREMENTS The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as "0" (not at all) to "3" (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients. RESULTS As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score {\textgreater} or =10 had a sensitivity of 88{\%} and a specificity of 88{\%} for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples. CONCLUSION In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of psychosocial factors with heart rate (HR) and its variability across multiple ethnic groups and by gender. Increased HR and reduced HR variability are markers of increased cardiovascular risk. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2002, 6814 men and women (2624 Whites, 1895 African-Americans, 1492 Hispanics, and 803 Chinese) aged 45 to 84 years took part in the first examination of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Associations of psychosocial variables with mean values of HR and its short-term variability were tested, using multivariate regression models. RESULTS: In age, gender, race/ethnicity, and risk factor-adjusted analyses, a depressive symptom score was positively associated with HR and inversely associated with HR variability (standard deviation of normal-to-normal (N-N) interbeat intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences in N-N intervals (RMSSD)). The adjusted mean differences per 1-SD (8 points) increment of depression score for HR, RMSSD, and SDNN were 0.5 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 0.2-0.7), -0.8 (95{\%} CI, -1.5 to -0.2), and -0.7 (95{\%} CI, -1.1 to -0.2). The social support score was inversely associated with HR, but nonsignificantly associated with RMSSD and SDNN. There was no association of trait anger or trait anxiety with HR, RMSSD, or SDNN. Associations were generally consistent in men and women. CONCLUSIONS: These findings generally support the hypothesis that depression may be associated with increased HR and reduced HR variability, which increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

abstract = {Mental stress testing has been proposed as a noninvasive tool to evaluate endothelium-dependent coronary vasomotion. In patients with coronary artery disease, mental stress can induce myocardial ischemia. However, even the determinants of the physiological myocardial blood flow (MBF) response to mental stress are poorly understood. Twenty-four individuals (12 males/12 females, mean age 49 +/- 13 yr, range 31-74 yr) with a low likelihood for coronary artery disease were studied. Serum catecholamines, cardiac work, and MBF (measured quantitatively with N-13 ammonia and positron emission tomography) were assessed. During mental stress (arithmetic calculation) MBF increased significantly from 0.70 +/- 0.14 to 0.92 +/- 0.21 ml x min(-1) x g(-1) (P {\textless} 0.01). Mental stress caused significant increases (P {\textless} 0.01) in serum epinephrine (26 +/- 16 vs. 42 +/- 17 pg/ml), norepinephrine (272 +/- 139 vs. 322 +/- 136 pg/ml), and cardiac work [rate-pressure product (RPP) 8,011 +/- 1,884 vs. 10,416 +/- 2,711]. Stress-induced changes in cardiac work were correlated with changes in MBF (r = 0.72; P {\textless} 0.01). Multiple-regression analysis revealed stress-induced changes in the RPP as the only significant (P = 0.0001) predictor for the magnitude of mental stress-induced increases in MBF in healthy individuals. Data from this group of healthy individuals should prove useful to investigate coronary vasomotion in individuals at risk for or with documented coronary artery disease.},

As such, standardized screening pathways for depression in patients with CVD offer the potential for early identification and optimal management of depression to improve health outcomes. Unfortunately, the burden of depression in patients with CVD is under-recognized; as a result, screening and management strategies targeting depression have been poorly implemented in patients with CVD.

abstract = {Depression occurs in people of all ages across all world regions; it is the second leading cause of disability and its global burden increased by 37.5{\%} between 1990 and 2010. Autonomic changes are often found in altered mood states and appear to be a central biological substrate linking depression to a number of physical dysfunctions. Alterations of autonomic nervous system functioning that promotes vagal withdrawal are reflected in reductions of heart rate variability (HRV) indexes. Reduced HRV characterizes emotional dysregulation, decreased psychological flexibility and defective social engagement, which in turn are linked to prefrontal cortex hypoactivity. Altogether, these pieces of evidence support the idea that HRV might represent a useful endophenotype for psychological/physical comorbidities, and its routine application should be advised to assess the efficacy of prevention/intervention therapies in a number of psychosomatic and psychiatric dysfunctions. Further research, also making use of appropriate animal models, could provide a significant support to this point of view and possibly help to identify appropriate antidepressant therapies that do not interefere with physical health.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased research attention is being paid to the negative impact of anger on coronary heart disease (CHD). METHODS AND RESULTS: This study examined prospectively the association between trait anger and the risk of combined CHD (acute myocardial infarction [MI]/fatal CHD, silent MI, or cardiac revascularization procedures) and of "hard" events (acute MI/fatal CHD). Participants were 12 986 black and white men and womenenrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities study. In the entire cohort, individuals with high trait anger, compared with their low anger counterparts, were at increased risk of CHD in both event categories. The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) (95{\%} CI) was 1.54 (95{\%} CI 1.10 to 2.16) for combined CHD and 1.75 (95{\%} CI 1.17 to 2.64) for "hard" events. Heterogeneity of effect was observed by hypertensive status. Among normotensive individuals, the risk of combined CHD and of "hard" events increased monotonically with increasing levels of trait anger. The multivariate-adjusted HR of CHD for high versus low anger was 2.20 (95{\%} CI 1.36 to 3.55) and for moderate versus low anger was 1.32 (95{\%} CI 0.94 to 1.84). For "hard" events, the multivariate-adjusted HRs were 2.69 (95{\%} CI 1.48 to 4.90) and 1.35 (95{\%} CI 0.87 to 2.10), respectively. No statistically significant association between trait anger and incident CHD risk was observed among hypertensive individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Proneness to anger places normotensive middle-aged men and women at significant risk for CHD morbidity and death independent of the established biological risk factors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Depression among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is prevalent and associated with an adverse quality of life and prognosis. Despite recommendations from some national organizations to screen for depression, it is unclear whether treatment of depression in patients with AMI is associated with better outcomes. We aimed to determine whether the prognosis of patients with treated versus untreated depression differs. METHODS The TRIUMPH study (Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients' Health Status) is an observational multicenter cohort study that enrolled 4062 patients aged â¥18 years with AMI between April 11, 2005, and December 31, 2008, from 24 US hospitals. Research coordinators administered the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) during the index AMI admission. Depression was defined by a PHQ-9 score of â¥10. Depression was categorized as treated if there was documentation of a discharge diagnosis, medication prescribed for depression, or referral for counseling, and as untreated if none of these 3 criteria was documented in the medical records despite a PHQ score â¥10. One-year mortality was compared between patients with AMI having: (1) no depression (PHQ-9{\textless}10; reference); (2) treated depression; and (3) untreated depression adjusting for demographics, AMI severity, and clinical factors. RESULTS Overall, 759 (18.7{\%}) patients met PHQ-9 criteria for depression and 231 (30.4{\%}) were treated. In comparison with 3303 patients without depression, the 231 patients with treated depression had 1-year mortality rates that were not different (6.1{\%} versus 6.7{\%}; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.12; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.63-1.99). In contrast, the 528 patients with untreated depression had higher 1-year mortality in comparison with patients without depression (10.8{\%} versus 6.1{\%}; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.91; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.39-2.62). CONCLUSIONS Although depression in patients with AMI is associated with increased long-term mortality, this association may be confined to patients with untreated depression.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Depression is an established risk factor for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), with an impact on cardiac prognosis; nonetheless, the literature disagrees on the role played by anxiety. No study has evaluated this relationship in a cardiac population with no history of depression and after their first diagnosis of ACS. The aim of this study is to explore these associations without the confounding role of long-lasting heart disease or psychiatric illnesses. METHOD Two hundred sixty-six patients with no history of depression completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorder at baseline and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months follow-up after their first diagnosis of ACS. During the follow-up period, we collected information regarding the major adverse cardiac events. RESULTS Developing a first-ever depressive episode, in a proportional hazard model, was associated with almost 3 times the risk of a recurrent cardiac event (odds ratio = 2.590, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] [1.321, 5.078], p = .006). Furthermore, a moderation analysis revealed that increasing levels of baseline anxiety had opposing effects on cardiac outcomes, being protective only in those who did not develop incident depression (B = -0.0824, 95{\%} CI [-0.164, -0.005], p = .048). No dose-response effect between depressive or anxious symptoms and cardiac outcomes emerged. CONCLUSION Our results confirm the detrimental effect of depression on cardiac prognosis in a selected population and suggest that anxiety after the first diagnosis of ACS might have different roles depending on the illness' course.

abstract = {Importance: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is a recognized phenomenon in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), but its clinical significance in the contemporary clinical era has not been investigated. Objective: To compare the association of mental stress-induced or conventional stress-induced ischemia with adverse cardiovascular events in patients with CHD. Design, Setting, and Participants: Pooled analysis of 2 prospective cohort studies of patients with stable CHD from a university-based hospital network in Atlanta, Georgia: the Mental Stress Ischemia Prognosis Study (MIPS) and the Myocardial Infarction and Mental Stress Study 2 (MIMS2). Participants were enrolled between June 2011 and March 2016 (last follow-up, February 2020). Exposures: Provocation of myocardial ischemia with a standardized mental stress test (public speaking task) and with a conventional (exercise or pharmacological) stress test, using single-photon emission computed tomography. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or first or recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction. The secondary end point additionally included hospitalizations for heart failure. Results: Of the 918 patients in the total sample pool (mean age, 60 years; 34{\%} women), 618 participated in MIPS and 300 in MIMS2. Of those, 147 patients (16{\%}) had mental stress-induced ischemia, 281 (31{\%}) conventional stress ischemia, and 96 (10{\%}) had both. Over a 5-year median follow-up, the primary end point occurred in 156 participants. The pooled event rate was 6.9 per 100 patient-years among patients with and 2.6 per 100 patient-years among patients without mental stress-induced ischemia. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for patients with vs those without mental stress-induced ischemia was 2.5 (95{\%} CI, 1.8-3.5). Compared with patients with no ischemia (event rate, 2.3 per 100 patient-years), patients with mental stress-induced ischemia alone had a significantly increased risk (event rate, 4.8 per 100 patient-years; HR, 2.0; 95{\%} CI, 1.1-3.7) as did patients with both mental stress ischemia and conventional stress ischemia (event rate, 8.1 per 100 patient-years; HR, 3.8; 95{\%} CI, 2.6-5.6). Patients with conventional stress ischemia alone did not have a significantly increased risk (event rate, 3.1 per 100 patient-years; HR, 1.4; 95{\%} CI, 0.9-2.1). Patients with both mental stress ischemia and conventional stress ischemia had an elevated risk compared with patients with conventional stress ischemia alone (HR, 2.7; 95{\%} CI, 1.7-4.3). The secondary end point occurred in 319 participants. The event rate was 12.6 per 100 patient-years for patients with and 5.6 per 100 patient-years for patients without mental stress-induced ischemia (adjusted HR, 2.0; 95{\%} CI, 1.5-2.5). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with stable coronary heart disease, the presence of mental stress-induced ischemia, compared with no mental stress-induced ischemia, was significantly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Although these findings may provide insights into mechanisms of myocardial ischemia, further research is needed to assess whether testing for mental stress-induced ischemia has clinical value..},

METHODS We prospectively enrolled patients with confirmed CAD in the Mental Stress Ischemia Prognosis Study (MIPS) between 2011 and 2014. All patients underwent mental stress testing using a standardized public speaking task, and ischemia was detected by Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging. Patients also underwent conventional stress testing for myocardial ischemia (CSIMI) using exercise or pharmacological stress testing. Furthermore, digital microvascular flow, endothelial function, arterial stiffness, and blood sample collections were performed before, during, and after mental stress. Two-year adverse clinical outcomes are being assessed. RESULTS Six-hundred ninety-five patients completed baseline enrollment in the MIPS. Their mean (standard deviation) age was 62.9 (9.1) years, 72{\%} were men, 30{\%} were African American, and 32{\%} had a history myocardial infarction. The prevalence of MSIMI and CSIMI is 16.1{\%} and 34.7{\%}, respectively. A total of 151 patients (22.9{\%}) had only CSIMI, 28 (4.2{\%}) had only MSIMI, and 78 (11.8{\%}) had both MSIMI and CSIMI. Patients with ischemia had a lower ejection fraction and higher prevalence of previous coronary artery bypass grafting compared with those without inducible ischemia (p {\textless} .050). The prevalence of obstructive CAD was not statistically different between patients with and without MSIMI (p = .426); in contrast, it was higher in patients with CSIMI (p {\textless} .001). CONCLUSIONS The MIPS data will provide useful information to assess the prognostic significance and underlying mechanisms of MSIMI.},

Objective To investigate the effect on long-term major adverse cardiac events (MACE) of escitalopram treatment of depression in patients with recent ACS. Design, Setting, and Participants Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted among 300 patients with recent ACS and depression enrolled from May 2007 to March 2013, with follow-up completed in June 2017, at Chonnam National University Hospital, Gwangju, South Korea. Interventions Patients were randomly assigned to receive either escitalopram in flexible dosages of 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg/d (n = 149) or matched placebo (n = 151) for 24 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was MACE, a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Four secondary outcomes were the individual MACE components of all-cause mortality, cardiac death, MI, and PCI. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the escitalopram and placebo groups by time to first MACE. Results Among 300 randomized patients (mean age, 60 years; 119 women [39.3{\%}]), 100{\%} completed a median of 8.1 (interquartile range, 7.5-9.0) years of follow-up.

This study systematically reviewed existing literature investigating, in healthy subjects, the associations between acute mental stress and short term Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measures in time, frequency and non-linear domain. The goal of this study was to provide reliable information about the trends and the pivot values of HRV measures during mental stress. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence was conducted, performing an exhaustive research of electronic repositories and linear researching references of papers responding to the inclusion criteria. After removing duplicates and not pertinent papers, journal papers describing well-designed studies that analyzed rigorously HRV were included if analyzed the same population of healthy subjects at rest and during mental stress. 12 papers were shortlisted, enrolling overall 758 volunteers and investigating 22 different HRV measures, 9 of which reported by at least 2 studies and therefore meta-analyzed in this review. Four measures in time and non-linear domains, associated with a normal degree of HRV variations resulted significantly depressed during stress. The power of HRV fluctuations at high frequencies was significantly depressed during stress, while the ratio between low and high frequency resulted significantly increased, suggesting a sympathetic activation and a parasympathetic withdrawal during acute mental stress. Finally, among the 15 non-linear measures extracted, only 2 were reported by at least 2 studies, therefore pooled, and only one resulted significantly depressed, suggesting a reduced chaotic behaviour during mental stress. HRV resulted significantly depressed during mental stress, showing a reduced variability and less chaotic behaviour. The pooled frequency domain measures demonstrated a significant autonomic balance shift during acute mental stress towards the sympathetic activation and the parasympathetic withdrawal. Pivot values for the pooled mean differences of HRV measures are provided. Further studies investigating HRV non-linear measures during mental stress are still required. However, the method proposed to transform and then meta-analyze the HRV measures can be applied to other fields where HRV proved to be clinically significant.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED In patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), mental stress may provoke ischemic electrocardiograph changes and abnormalities in regional and global left ventricular function. However, little is known about the underlying myocardial blood flow response (MBF) in these patients. METHODS We investigated the hemodynamic, neurohumoral, and myocardial blood flow responses to mental stress in 17 patients with CAD and 17 healthy volunteers of similar age. Mental stress was induced by asking individuals to solve mathematic subtractions in a progressively challenging sequence; MBF was quantified at rest and during mental stress using 13N ammonia PET. RESULTS Mental stress induced significant (P {\textless} 0.01) and comparable increases in rate-pressure product, measured in beats per minute x mm Hg, in both patients (from 7826 +/- 2006 to 10586 +/- 2800) and healthy volunteers (from 8227 +/- 1272 to 10618 +/- 2468). Comparable increases also occurred in serum epinephrine (58{\%} in patients versus 52{\%} in healthy volunteers) and norepinephrine (22{\%} in patients versus 27{\%} in healthy volunteers). Although MBF increased in patients (from 0.67 +/- 0.15 to 0.77 +/- 0.18 mL/min/g, P {\textless} 0.05) and healthy volunteers (from 0.73 +/- 0.13 to 0.95 +/- 0.22 mL/min/g, P {\textless} 0.001), the magnitude of flow increase was smaller in patients (14{\%} +/- 17{\%}) than in healthy volunteers (29{\%} +/- 14{\%}) (P = 0.01). The increase in MBF during mental stress correlated significantly with changes in cardiac work in healthy volunteers (r = 0.77; P {\textless} 0.001) but not in patients. CONCLUSION Despite similar increases in cardiac work and comparable sympathetic stimulation in CAD patients and healthy volunteers, CAD patients exhibit an attenuated blood flow response to mental stress that may contribute to mental stress-induced ischemic episodes in daily life.},

abstract = {Decreased heart rate (HR) variability is an independent risk factor for mortality in cardiac populations. Clinical depression has also been associated with adverse outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). This study tests the hypothesis that depressed patients with CAD have decreased HR variability compared with nondepressed CAD patients. Nineteen patients with angiographically documented CAD and either major or minor depression were compared with a sample of nondepressed CAD patients according to age, sex, and smoking status. All patients underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring, and the standard deviation of all normal-to-normal intervals was used as the primary index of HR variability. HR variability was significantly lower in depressed than nondepressed patients (90 Â± 35 vs 117 Â± 26 ms; p {\textless} 0.01), even after adjusting for relevant covariates. Thus, decreased HR variability may help explain the increased risk for cardiac mortality and morbidity in depressed CAD patients. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Background--Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is associated with adverse prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), yet the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. We hypothesized that compared with exercise/pharmacological stress-induced myocardial ischemia (PSIMI) that is secondary to the atherosclerotic burden of CAD, MSIMI is primarily due to vasomotor changes. Methods and Results--Patients with angiographically documented CAD underwent 99mTc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest and following both mental and physical stress testing, performed on separate days. The severity and extent of CAD were quantified using the Gensini and Sullivan scores. Peripheral arterial tonometry (Itamar Inc) was used to assess the digital microvascular tone during mental stress as a ratio of pulse wave amplitude during speech compared with baseline. Measurements were made in a discovery sample (n=225) and verified in a replication sample (n=159). In the pooled (n=384) sample, CAD severity and extent scores were not significantly different between those with and without MSIMI, whereas they were greater in those with compared with those without PSIMI (P {\textless} 0.04 for all). The peripheral arterial tonometry ratio was lower in those with compared with those without MSIMI (0.55Â±0.36 versus 0.76Â±0.52, P=0.009). In a multivariable analysis, the peripheral arterial tonometry ratio was the only independent predictor of MSIMI (P=0.009), whereas angiographic severity and extent of CAD independently predicted PSIMI. Conclusions--The degree of digital microvascular constriction, and not the angiographic burden of CAD, is associated with MSIMI. Varying causes of MSIMI compared with PSIMI may require different therapeutic interventions that require further study.},

abstract = {Depression is common in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and is a risk factor for cardiac morbidity and mortality in these patients. Depression is associated with autonomic nervous system dysfunction, which may at least partially explain this increased risk. Low heart rate variability (HRV), which reflects excessive sympathetic and/or inadequate parasympathetic modulation of heart rate, is a strong predictor of mortality in patients with CHD. Most studies-both in patients with stable CHD and in patients with a recent acute coronary event-have found HRV to be lower in depressed patients than in their nondepressed counterparts. This manuscript provides an overview of this literature and concludes that HRV may account for a substantial part of the risk associated with depression in CHD.},

abstract = {Background: Although exercise-associated ventricular arrhythmias are frequently observed during exercise testing, their prognostic significance remains uncertain. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the clinical correlates and prognostic significance of exercise-associated premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) during and after exercise testing. Methods: We studied 1847 heart failure-free patients who underwent clinical treadmill testing between March 13, 1997, and January 15, 2004, in the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the clinical and exercise test associations of exercise and recovery PVCs. Propensity score-adjusted Cox survival analyses were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of exercise-associated PVCs. Results: Of the 1847 subjects, 850 (46.0{\%}) developed exercise PVCs (median rate, 0.43 per minute) and 620 (33.6{\%}) had recovery PVCs (median rate, 0.60 per minute). Resting PVCs, age, and systolic blood pressure were key predictors of both exercise and recovery PVCs. Whereas exercise PVCs were related to the heart rate increase with exercise, recovery PVCs were related to coronary disease (previous myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization procedure, or pathological Q waves on resting electrocardiogram) and ST-segment depression. During a 5.4-year mean follow-up, 161 subjects (8.7{\%}) died, and 53 of these deaths (32.9{\%}) were due to cardiovascular causes. Recovery PVCs, but not exercise PVCs, were associated with 71{\%} to 96{\%} greater propensity-adjusted mortality rates (hazard ratio, 1.96 [95{\%} confidence interval, 1.31-2.91] for infrequent PVCs; hazard ratio, 1.71 [95{\%} confidence interval, 1.07-2.73] for frequent PVCs compared with subjects without PVCs), and occurrence of recovery PVCs reclassified 33.2{\%} of subjects with intermediate-risk Duke Treadmill Scores into higher-risk subgroups. Conclusion: In our heart failure-free population, recovery PVCs were associated with increased mortality and augmented established risk markers. {\textcopyright}2008 American Medical Association.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is a common phenomenon in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and an emerging prognostic factor. Mental stress ischemia is correlated with ambulatory ischemia. However, whether it is related to angina symptoms during daily life has not been examined. METHODS: We assessed angina frequency (past month) in 98 post-myocardial infarction (MI) subjects (age 18-60 years) using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. Patients underwent [(99m)Tc]sestamibi SPECT perfusion imaging at rest, after mental stress, and after exercise/pharmacological stress. Summed scores of perfusion abnormalities were obtained by observer-independent software. A summed difference score (SDS), the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. RESULTS: The mean age was 50 years, 50{\%} were female and 60{\%} were non-white. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, CAD severity, depressive, anger, and anxiety symptoms, each 1-point increase in mental stress-SDS was associated with 1.73-unit increase in the angina frequency score (95{\%} CI: 0.09-3.37) and 17{\%} higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.17, 95{\%} CI: 1.00-1.38). Depressive symptoms were associated with 12{\%} higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.12, 95{\%} CI: 1.03-1.21). In contrast, exercise/pharmacological stress-induced SDS was not associated with angina frequency. CONCLUSION: Among young and middle-aged post-MI patients, myocardial ischemia induced by mental stress in the lab, but not by exercise/pharmacological stress, is associated with higher frequency of retrospectively reported angina during the day. Psychosocial stressors related to mental stress ischemia may be important contributory factor to daily angina.},

@article{Mittleman1995,
abstract = {Background Many anecdotes and several uncontrolled case series have suggested that emotionally stressful events, and more specifically, anger, immediately precede and appear to trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction. However, controlled studies to determine the relative risk of myocardial infarction after episodes of anger have not been reported. Methods and Results We interviewed 1623 patients (501 women) an average of 4 days after myocardial infarction. The interview identified the time, place, and quality of myocardial infarction pain and other symptoms, the estimated usual frequency of anger during the previous year, and the intensity and timing of anger and other potentially triggering factors during the 26 hours before the onset of myocardial infarction. Anger was assessed by the onset anger scale, a single-item, seven-level, self-report scale, and the state anger subscale of the State-Trait Personality Inventory. Occurrence of anger in the 2 hours preceding the onset of myocardial infarction was compared with its expected frequency using two types of self-matched control data based on the case-crossover study design. The onset anger scale identified 39 patients with episodes of anger in the 2 hours before the onset of myocardial infarction. The relative risk of myocardial infarction in the 2 hours after an episode of anger was 2.3 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.7 to 3.2). The state anger subscale corroborated these findings with a relative risk of 1.9 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.7). Regular users of aspirin had a significantly lower relative risk (1.4; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.8 to 2.6) than nonusers (2.9; 95{\%} confidence interval, 2.0 to 4.1) (P{\textless}.05). Conclusions Episodes of anger are capable of triggering the onset of acute myocardial infarction, but aspirin may reduce this risk. A better understanding of the manner in which external events trigger the onset of acute cardiovascular events may lead to innovative preventive strategies aimed at severing the link between these external stressors and their pathological consequences.},

abstract = {There is a bidirectional relationship between affective disorders and cardiovascular abnormalities, often described as a downward spiral, whereas major depressive disorders (MDD, and anxiety disorders) significantly increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVD); CVD are also associated with increased risk of developing MDD (and anxiety disorders). Moreover, the prognosis and progression of CVD is significantly worsened in the presence of MDD. Heart rate variability (HRV) has often been suggested as a potential mediator in this comorbidity. In this review, we discuss HRV alterations in MDD. However, we mainly focus on the direct relationship between HRV alterations and psychiatric symptoms, rather than its relationship with CVD, as this has been reviewed elsewhere. After a general introduction to HRV and how it can be measured, we review how HRV is altered in MDD. We subsequently describe how antidepressant drugs affect HRV, showing that some classes (such as tricyclics) generally worsen HRV, whereas others (most notably selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) have a more positive influence. We also review the effects of several other treatments, with a special focus on vagal nerve stimulation, finishing with some further considerations and recommendation for further research, both in humans and animals., Copyright (C) 2018 YEAR Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

This is followed by mental stress as a scientific idea and the relatively new notions of allostasis and allostatic load. Experimental models of mental stress in rodents and humans are discussed, with particular attention to ethical constraints in humans. Sections follow on sympathoneural responses to mental stress, reactivity of catecholamine systems, clinical pathophysiologic states, and the cardiovascular reactivity hypothesis.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of psychosocial factors with heart rate (HR) and its variability across multiple ethnic groups and by gender. Increased HR and reduced HR variability are markers of increased cardiovascular risk. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2002, 6814 men and women (2624 Whites, 1895 African-Americans, 1492 Hispanics, and 803 Chinese) aged 45 to 84 years took part in the first examination of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Associations of psychosocial variables with mean values of HR and its short-term variability were tested, using multivariate regression models. RESULTS: In age, gender, race/ethnicity, and risk factor-adjusted analyses, a depressive symptom score was positively associated with HR and inversely associated with HR variability (standard deviation of normal-to-normal (N-N) interbeat intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences in N-N intervals (RMSSD)). The adjusted mean differences per 1-SD (8 points) increment of depression score for HR, RMSSD, and SDNN were 0.5 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 0.2-0.7), -0.8 (95{\%} CI, -1.5 to -0.2), and -0.7 (95{\%} CI, -1.1 to -0.2). The social support score was inversely associated with HR, but nonsignificantly associated with RMSSD and SDNN. There was no association of trait anger or trait anxiety with HR, RMSSD, or SDNN. Associations were generally consistent in men and women. CONCLUSIONS: These findings generally support the hypothesis that depression may be associated with increased HR and reduced HR variability, which increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

abstract = {A vast body of literature has revealed that dysregulation of the hypothalamicâpituitaryâadrenal (HPA) stress axis is associated with etiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). There are many ways that the dysregulation of the HPA axis can be assessed: by sampling diurnal basal secretion and/or in response to a stress task, pharmacological challenge, and awakening. Here, we focus on the association between cortisol awakening response (CAR), as one index of HPA axis function, and MDD, given that the nature of this association is particularly unclear. Indeed, in the following selective review, we attempt to reconcile sometimes-divergent evidence of the role of CAR in the pathway to depression. We first examine association of CAR with psychological factors that have been linked with increased vulnerability to develop depression. Then, we summarize the findings regarding the CAR profile in those with current depression, and evaluate evidence for the role of CAR following depression resolution and continued vulnerability. Finally, we showcase longitudinal studies showing the role of CAR in predicting depression onset and recurrence. Overall, the studies reveal an important, but complex, association between CAR and vulnerability to depression.},

abstract = {Psychological depression is shown to be associated with several aspects of coronary artery disease (CAD), including arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, heart failure and sudden death. The physiological mechanisms accounting for this association are unclear. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal dysregulation, diminished heart rate variability, altered blood platelet function and noncompliance with medial treatments have been proposed as mechanisms underlying depression and cardiovascular disease. Recent evidence also suggests that reduced baroreflex sensitivity, impaired immune function, chronic fatigue and the co-morbidity of depression and anxiety may be involved in the relationship between depression and cardiovascular dysregulation. An experimental strategy using animal models for investigating underlying physiological abnormalities in depression is presented. A key to understanding the bidirectional association between depression and heart disease is to determine whether there are common changes in brain systems that are associated with these conditions. Such approaches may hold promise for advancing our understanding of the interaction between this mood disorder and CAD. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Major depressive disorder (MDD) occurs in 15{\%} to 23{\%} of patients with acute coronary syndromes and constitutes an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality. However, no published evidence exists that antidepressant drugs are safe or efficacious in patients with unstable ischemic heart disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of sertraline treatment of MDD in patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina and free of other life-threatening medical conditions. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 40 outpatient cardiology centers and psychiatry clinics in the United States, Europe, Canada, and Australia. Enrollment began in April 1997 and follow-up ended in April 2001. PATIENTS: A total of 369 patients with MDD (64{\%} male; mean age, 57.1 years; mean 17-item Hamilton Depression [HAM-D] score, 19.6; MI, 74{\%}; unstable angina, 26{\%}). INTERVENTION: After a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in, patients were randomly assigned to receive sertraline in flexible dosages of 50 to 200 mg/d (n = 186) or placebo (n = 183) for 24 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary (safety) outcome measure was change from baseline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); secondary measures included surrogate cardiac measures and cardiovascular adverse events, as well as scores on the HAM-D scale and Clinical Global Impression Improvement scale (CGI-I) in the total randomized sample, in a group with any prior history of MDD, and in a more severe MDD subgroup defined a priori by a HAM-D score of at least 18 and history of 2 or more prior episodes of MDD. RESULTS: Sertraline had no significant effect on mean (SD) LVEF (sertraline: baseline, 54{\%} [10{\%}]; week 16, 54{\%} [11{\%}]; placebo: baseline, 52{\%} [13{\%}]; week 16, 53{\%} [13{\%}]), treatment-emergent increase in ventricular premature complex (VPC) runs (sertraline: 13.1{\%}; placebo: 12.9{\%}), QTc interval greater than 450 milliseconds at end point (sertraline: 12{\%}; placebo: 13{\%}), or other cardiac measures. All comparisons were statistically nonsignificant (P{\textgreater} or = .05). The incidence of severe cardiovascular adverse events was 14.5{\%} with sertraline and 22.4{\%} with placebo. In the total randomized sample, the CGI-I (P =.049), but not the HAM-D (P =.14), favored sertraline. The CGI-I responder rates for sertraline were significantly higher than for placebo in the total sample (67{\%} vs 53{\%}; P =.01), in the group with at least 1 prior episode {\ldots}},

abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is prevalent. Although standards antidepressants are more effective than placebo, up to 35{\%} of patients do not respond to 4 or more conventional treatments and are considered to have treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Considerable effort has been devoted to trying to find effective treatments for TRD. This review focuses on vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), approved for TRD in 2005 by the Food and Drugs Administration. Stimulation is carried by bipolar electrodes on the left cervical vagus nerve, which are attached to an implanted stimulator generator. The vagus bundle contains about 80{\%} of afferent fibers terminating in the medulla, from which there are projections to many areas of brain, including the limbic forebrain. Various types of brain imaging studies reveal widespread functional effects in brain after either acute or chronic VNS. Although more randomized control trials of VNS need to be carried out before a definitive conclusion can be reached about its efficacy, the results of open studies, carried out over period of 1 to 2 years, show much more efficacy when compared with results from treatment as usual studies. There is an increase in clinical response to VNS between 3 and 12 months, which is quite different from that seen with standard antidepressant treatment of MDD. Preclinically, VNS affects many of the same brain areas, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine) and signal transduction mechanisms (brain-derived neurotrophic factorâtropomyosin receptor kinase B) as those found with traditional antidepressants. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which VNS benefits patients nonresponsive to conventional antidepressants is unclear, with further research needed to clarify this.},

Yet, the heterogeneous nature of depression has impeded efforts to understand, prevent, and treat the disease. The purpose of this integrative review is to summarize the connections between inflammation and established core features of depression that exhibit more homogeneity than the syndrome itself: exaggerated reactivity to negative information, altered reward processing, decreased cognitive control, and somatic syndrome. For each core feature, we first provide a brief overview of its relevance to depression and neurobiological underpinnings, and then review evidence investigating a potential role of inflammation. We focus primarily on findings from experimental paradigms of exogenously-induced inflammation. We conclude that inflammation likely plays a role in exaggerated reactivity to negative information, altered reward reactivity, and somatic symptoms. There is less evidence supporting an effect of inflammation on cognitive control as assessed by standard neuropsychological measures. Finally, we discuss implications for future research and recommendationsfor how to test the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of heterogeneous psychiatric disorders.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the present paper, we describe a model of neurovisceral integration in which a set of neural structures involved in cognitive, affective, and autonomic regulation are related to heart rate variability (HRV) and cognitive performance. METHODS: We detail the pathways involved in the neural regulation of the cardiovascular system and provide pharmacological and neuroimaging data in support of the neural structures linking the central nervous system to HRV in humans. We review a number of studies from our group showing that individual differences in HRV are related to performance on tasks associated with executive function and prefrontal cortical activity. These studies include comparisons of executive- and nonexecutive-function tasks in healthy participants, in both threatening and nonthreatening conditions. In addition, we show that manipulating resting HRV levels is associated with changes in performance on executive-function tasks. We also examine the relationship between HRV and cognitive performance in ecologically valid situations using a police shooting simulation and a naval navigation simulation. Finally, we review our studies in anxiety patients, as well as studies examining psychopathy. CONCLUSION: These findings in total suggest an important relationship among cognitive performance, HRV, and prefrontal neural function that has important implications for both physical and mental health. Future studies are needed to determine exactly which executive functions are associated with individual differences in HRV in a wider range of situations and populations.},

In addition, numerous clinical trials have been conducted to attempt to prevent or lessen the impact of these conditions on cardiovascular health. In this article, we review studies connecting depression, stress/PTSD, and anxiety to CVD, focusing on findings from the last 5 years.

abstract = {Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a relatively common condition, with a 7{\%}to 9{\%}lifetime prevalence in US civilians and a 15 {\%} to 19 {\%} lifetime prevalence in combat veterans. 1 Neurobiological dysregulation of autonomic nervous system pathways involved in the stress response has long been considered a hallmark of the abnormal physiologic processes and clinical presentation of PTSD. Common symptoms of PTSD, such as intrusions and hyperarousal, are likely mediated by the autonomic nervous system. Furthermore, autonomic dysregulation, indexed by low heart rate variability (HRV), is a consistent correlate of PTSD symptoms and may improve when PTSD is in remission. 2 Although PTSD by definition is a consequence of a traumatic event, not every person exposed to trauma develops the condition. 3 However, our ability to predict vulnerability to PTSD is limited, and this issue remains an important topic of exploration. If we knew how to identify at-risk individuals, then we could devise preventive interventions for such people in the armed services before deployment that might prevent PTSD or ameliorate its clinical course. Treatment with 2 main classes of pharmacologic therapies potentially influencing stress systems response ($\beta$-blockers and systemic corticosteroids) has been attempted immediately after trauma exposure. However, a recent Cochrane review 4 found that only hydrocortisone administration immediately after trauma had sufficient evidence to protect individuals from the development of PTSD, with a number needed to treat ranging from 7 to 13. Decisions to administer such agents should be based on careful evaluation of risks and benefits given possible adverse effects, such as immunosuppression. Behavioral interventions, such as cognitive therapy, would also be applicable and are low risk, but they are costly and time consuming; thus, careful risk stratification would again be necessary. Previous studies 3 have shown that higher heart rate and cortisol sensitivity in individuals who experience trauma, measured immediately after exposure, predict subsequent PTSD development. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, no previous studies have evaluated},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity. MEASUREMENTS The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as "0" (not at all) to "3" (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients. RESULTS As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score {\textgreater} or =10 had a sensitivity of 88{\%} and a specificity of 88{\%} for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples. CONCLUSION In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.},

abstract = {Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) has been associated with adverse prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but whether this is a uniform finding across different studies has not been described. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies examining the association between MSIMI and adverse outcome events in patients with stable CAD. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases for English language prospective studies of patients with CAD who underwent standardized mental stress testing to determine presence of MSIMI and were followed up for subsequent cardiac events or total mortality. Our outcomes of interest were CAD recurrence, CAD mortality, or total mortality. A summary effect estimate was derived using a fixed-effects meta-analysis model. Only 5 studies, each with a sample size of {\textless}200 patients and fewer than 50 outcome events, met the inclusion criteria. The pooled samples comprised 555 patients with CAD (85{\%} male) and 117 events with a range of follow-up from 35 days to 8.8 years. Pooled analysis showed that MSIMI was associated with a twofold increased risk of a combined end point of cardiac events or total mortality (relative risk 2.24, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.59 to 3.15). No heterogeneity was detected among the studies (Q = 0.39, I2= 0.0{\%}, p = 0.98). In conclusion, although few selected studies have examined the association between MSIMI and adverse events in patients with CAD, all existing investigations point to approximately a doubling of risk. Whether this increased risk is generalizable to the CAD population at large and varies in patient subgroups warrant further investigation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We update these findings using recent data, focusing on MDD alone and accounting for comorbid physical and psychiatric disorders. Method: Using national survey (DSM-IV criteria) and administrative claims data (ICD-9 codes), we estimate the incremental economic burden of individuals with MDD as well as the share of these costs attributable to MDD, with attention to any changes that occurred between 2005 and 2010. Results: The incremental economic burden of individuals with MDD increased by 21.5{\%} (from {\$}173.2 billion to {\$}210.5 billion, inflation-adjusted dollars). The composition of these costs remained stable, with approximately 45{\%} attributable to direct costs, 5{\%} to suicide-related costs, and 50{\%} to workplace costs. Only 38{\%} of the total costs were due to MDD itself as opposed to comorbid conditions. Conclusions: Comorbid conditions account for the largest portion of the growing economic burden of MDD. Future research should analyze further these comorbidities as well as the relative importance of factors contributing to that growing burden. These include population growth, increase in MDD prevalence, increase in treatment cost per individual with MDD, changes in employment and treatment rates, as well as changes in the composition and quality of MDD treatment services.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To investigate sex-specific vascular mechanisms for mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI). APPROACH AND RESULTS Baseline data from a prospective cohort study of 678 patients with coronary artery disease underwent myocardial perfusion imaging before and during a public speaking stressor. The rate-pressure product response was calculated as the difference between the maximum value during the speech minus the minimum value during rest. Peripheral vasoconstriction by peripheral arterial tonometry was calculated as the ratio of pulse wave amplitude during the speech over the resting baseline; ratios {\textless}1 indicate a vasoconstrictive response. MSIMI was defined as percent of left ventricle that was ischemic and as a dichotomous variable. Men (but not women) with MSIMI had a higher rate-pressure product response than those without MSIMI (6500 versus 4800 mm Hg bpm), whereas women (but not men) with MSIMI had a significantly lower peripheral arterial tonometry ratio than those without MSIMI (0.5 versus 0.8). In adjusted linear regression, each 1000-U increase in rate-pressure product response was associated with 0.32{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.22-0.42) increase in inducible ischemia among men, whereas each 0.10-U decrease in peripheral arterial tonometry ratio was associated with 0.23{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.11-0.35) increase in inducible myocardial ischemia among women. Results were independent of conventional stress-induced myocardial ischemia. CONCLUSIONS Women and men have distinct cardiovascular reactivity mechanisms for MSIMI. For women, stress-induced peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress, and not increased hemodynamic workload, is associated with MSIMI, whereas for men, it is the opposite. Future studies should examine these pathways on long-term outcomes.},

abstract = {Background: Recent studies have shown that depressive disorder is associated with impaired baroreceptor or baroreflex sensitivity, which is proposed to be a predisposing factor for sudden death in patients with manifest cardiac disease. These studies have not evaluated the afferent and efferent components of the cardiac baroreflex loop or other baroreflex mechanisms that regulate target processes (cardiac metabolism and blood pressure variability) related to the impairment. The objective of this study was to gain more insight into autonomic functioning in depressive disorder to more fully examine the potential basis for increased cardiac mortality. Methods: The subjects were 28 women and men with unipolar major depression who were taking antidepressant medications and who were in partial remission and free of cardiovascular or other serious disease, and 28 healthy control subjects matched for sex, age, and ethnicity. The two samples were compared for negative affective dispositions (anger expression, hostility, defensiveness, anxiety), spontaneous (closed-loop) baroreflex activity, heart rate, heart rate variability, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate-systolic blood pressure double product under resting conditions. Results: Depressed patients showed a general disposition to anger suppression coupled with higher hostility and anxiety, and lower defensiveness. The patients showed higher general sympathetic activity (high levels of blood pressure, low-frequency heart rate variability) and lower parasympathetic-related activity (high heart rate and reduced high frequency heart rate variability) with affected cardiac metabolism estimated by the double product. Depressed patients had lower baroreflex sensitivity related to a higher gain of the afferent component of the baroreflex without respective gain adjustment of its efferent component (reflex gain 'de-afferentation'). It was coupled with a compensatory higher number of effective baroreflex reactions (reflex gating 're-afferentation'). Antidepressant agents and depressed mood had additional independent effects on baroreflex sensitivity through the efferent component of the cardiac baroreflex loop. Conclusions: The data indicate that different baroreflex components and mechanisms may be impaired in patients with depression and may contribute to their increased cardiac risk. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with coronary heart disease (CHD), but the mechanisms are unclear. The presence of MDD may increase CHD risk by affecting microvascular circulation. It is also plausible that genetic factors influencing MDD may overlap with those for CHD. We sought to examine the relationship between MDD and coronary flow reserve (CFR), the ratio of maximum flow during stress to flow at rest measured in milliliters per minute per gram of tissue. Methods We examined 289 male middle-aged twins, including 106 twins (53 twin pairs) discordant for a lifetime history of MDD and 183 control twins (unrelated to any twins in the experimental group) without MDD. To calculate CFR, we used positron emission tomography with nitrogen 13 (13N) ammonia to evaluate myocardial blood flow at rest and after adenosine stress. A standard perfusion defect score was also used to assess myocardial ischemia. Results There was no difference in myocardial ischemia between twins with and without MDD. Among the dizygotic twin pairs discordant for MDD, the CFR was 14{\%} lower in the twins with MDD than in their brothers without MDD (2.36 vs 2.74) (P = .03). This association was not present in the monozygotic discordant pairs who were genetically matched (2.86 vs 2.64) (P = .19). The zygosity-MDD interaction after adjustment was significant (P = .006). The CFR in the dizygotic twins with MDD was also lower than in the control twins. Conclusions Our results provide evidence for a shared genetic pathway between MDD and microvascular dysfunction. Common pathophysiologic processes may link MDD and early atherosclerosis.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine in a nonclinical sample of preadolescents the possibility that somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms are differentially related with the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Depression is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Dysregulation of the ANS and the HPA axis have been proposed as underlying mechanisms. Several studies suggest that only a subset of the depression symptoms account for associations with cardiovascular prognosis. METHODS: Self-reported somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms were examined in relationship to heart rate variability (HRV), spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), and the cortisol awakening response (CAR) in 2049 preadolescents (mean age = 11.1 years; 50.7{\%} = girls) from the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS). RESULTS: Physiological measurements were not associated with the overall measure of depressive symptoms. Somatic depressive symptoms were negatively related to HRV and BRS, and positively to the CAR; cognitive-affective depressive symptoms were positively related to HRV and BRS, and negatively to the CAR. Associations with the CAR pertained to boys only. CONCLUSIONS: Somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms differ in their association with both cardiac autonomic and HPA axis function in preadolescents. Particularly, somatic depression symptoms may mark cardiac risk.},

abstract = {Background: The pathophysiology of mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia, which occurs, at lower heart rates than during physical stress, is not well understood. Methods and Results: The Psychophysiological Investigations of Myocardial Ischemia Study (PIMI) evaluated the physiological and neuroendocrine functioning in unmedicated patients with stable coronary artery disease and exercise-induced ischemia. Hemodynamic and neurohormonal responses to bicycle exercise, public speaking, and the Stroop test were measured by radionuclide ventriculography, ECG, and blood pressure and catecholamine monitoring. With mental stress, there were increases in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance that were correlated with increases in plasma epinephrine. During exercise, systemic vascular resistance fell, and there was no relationship between the hemodynamic changes and epinephrine levels. The fall in ejection fraction was greater with mental stress than exercise. During mental stress, the changes in election fraction were inversely correlated with the changes in systemic vascular resistance. Evidence for myocardial ischemia was present in 92{\%} of patients during bicycle exercise and in 58{\%} of patients during mental stress. Greater increases in plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine occurred with ischemia during exercise, and greater increases in systemic vascular resistance occurred with ischemia during mental stress. Conclusions: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is associated with a significant increase in systemic vascular resistance and a relatively minor increase in heart rate and rate-pressure product compared with ischemia induced by exercise. These hemodynamic responses to mental stress can be mediated by the adrenal secretion of epinephrine. The pathophysiological mechanisms involved are important in the understanding of the etiology of myocardial ischemia and perhaps in the selection of appropriate anti-ischemic therapy.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE Disrupted autonomic nervous system functioning as measured by heart rate variability (HRV) has been associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is not clear, however, whether reduced HRV before trauma exposure contributes to the risk for development of PTSD. OBJECTIVE To examine whether HRV before combat deployment is associated with increased risk of a PTSD diagnosis after deployment when accounting for deployment-related combat exposure. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Between July 14, 2008, and May 24, 2012, active-duty Marines were assessed 1 to 2 months before a combat deployment and again 4 to 6 months after their return. The first phase of the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS-I) included 1415 male Marines, 59 of whom developed PTSD after deployment. Participants in the second phase of the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS-II) included 745 male Marines, 25 of whom developed PTSD after deployment. Analysis was conducted from November 25, 2013, to April 16, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Predeployment HRVwas measured via finger photoplethysmography during a 5-minute period of rest. Frequency-domain measures of HRV were generated. Diagnosis of PTSD was determined using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. RESULTS After accounting for deployment-related combat exposure, lower HRV before deployment as measured by an increased low-frequency (LF) to high-frequency (HF) ratio of HRV was associated with risk of PTSD diagnosis after deployment (combined MRS-I and MRS-II cohortmeta-analysis odds ratio, 1.47; 95{\%}CI, 1.10-1.98; P = .01). The prevalence of postdeployment PTSD was higher in participants with high predeployment LF:HF ratios (15.8{\%} [6 of 38 participants]) compared with participants who did not have high LF:HF ratios (3.7{\%}[78 of 2122 participants]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This prospective longitudinal study provides initial and modest evidence that an altered state of autonomic nervous system functioning contributes to PTSD vulnerability, taking into account other key risk factors. If these findings are replicated, interventions that change autonomic nervous system function may open novel opportunities for prevention and treatment of PTSD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression is associated with an increased risk for mortality after acute myocardial infarction (MI). The purpose of this study was to determine whether low heart rate variability (HRV) mediates the effect of depression on mortality. METHODS: Twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were obtained from 311 depressed patients with a recent acute MI who were enrolled in the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease (ENRICHD) clinical trial and from 367 nondepressed patients who met the ENRICHD medical inclusion criteria. Standard HRV indexes were extracted from the recordings. RESULTS: The log of very low-frequency (LnVLF) power, an index of HRV derived from power spectral analysis of the electrocardiogram signal (0.0033-0.04 Hz [in milliseconds squared]), was lower in the depressed than in the nondepressed patients (P{\textless}.001). There were 47 deaths (6.1{\%}) during a 30-month follow-up. After adjusting for potential confounders, the depressed patients remained at higher risk for all-cause mortality compared with the nondepressed patients (hazard ratio, 2.8; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.4-5.4; P{\textless}.003). When LnVLF power was entered into the model, the hazard ratio for depression dropped to 2.1 (95{\%} CI, 1.1-4.2; P = .03). The proportion of the risk for depression attributable to LnVLF power was 0.27 (95{\%} CI, 0.23-0.31; P{\textless}.001). CONCLUSIONS: Low HRV partially mediates the effect of depression on survival after acute MI. This finding helps to clarify the physiological mechanisms underlying depression's role as a risk factor for mortality in patients with coronary heart disease. It also raises the possibility that treatments that improve both depression and HRV might also improve survival in these patients.},

abstract = {Background Emotional stress is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. We imaged the amygdala, a brain region involved in stress, to determine whether its resting metabolic activity predicts risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. Methods Individuals aged 30 years or older without known cardiovascular disease or active cancer disorders, who underwent 18F-fluorodexoyglucose PET/CT at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA, USA) between Jan 1, 2005, and Dec 31, 2008, were studied longitudinally. Amygdalar activity, bone-marrow activity, and arterial inflammation were assessed with validated methods. In a separate cross-sectional study we analysed the relation between perceived stress, amygdalar activity, arterial inflammation, and C-reactive protein. Image analyses and cardiovascular disease event adjudication were done by mutually blinded researchers. Relations between amygdalar activity and cardiovascular disease events were assessed with Cox models, log-rank tests, and mediation (path) analyses. Findings 293 patients (median age 55 years [IQR 45{\textperiodcentered}0â65{\textperiodcentered}5]) were included in the longitudinal study, 22 of whom had a cardiovascular disease event during median follow-up of 3{\textperiodcentered}7 years (IQR 2{\textperiodcentered}7â4{\textperiodcentered}8). Amygdalar activity was associated with increased bone-marrow activity (r=0{\textperiodcentered}47; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), arterial inflammation (r=0{\textperiodcentered}49; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), and risk of cardiovascular disease events (standardised hazard ratio 1{\textperiodcentered}59, 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}27â1{\textperiodcentered}98; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), a finding that remained significant after multivariate adjustments. The association between amygdalar activity and cardiovascular disease events seemed to be mediated by increased bone-marrow activity and arterial inflammation in series. In the separate cross-sectional study of patients who underwent psychometric analysis (n=13), amygdalar activity was significantly associated with arterial inflammation (r=0{\textperiodcentered}70; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0083). Perceived stress was associated with amygdalar activity (r=0{\textperiodcentered}56; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0485), arterial inflammation (r=0{\textperiodcentered}59; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0345), and C-reactive protein (r=0{\textperiodcentered}83; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0210). Interpretation In this first study to link regional brain activity to subsequent cardiovascular disease, amygdalar activity independently and robustly predicted cardiovascular disease events. Amygdalar activity is involved partly via a path that includes increased bone-marrow activity and arterial inflammation. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanism through which emotional stressors can lead to cardiovascular disease in human beings. Funding None.},

abstract = {High cardiac vagal control (as measured by respiratory sinus arrhythmia; RSA) is associated with lower depression. Recent theories argue that people's responsiveness to social resources is a key mechanism in this association. This argument implies two hypotheses: first, high RSA should be related to decreased depressive symptoms only when social resources (social support) are available; second, utilization of available social resources (social engagement) should serve as a mechanism for the positive effects of RSA. To test these hypotheses, we measured RSA in 131 adults. Participants reported their social support, social engagement, and depressive symptoms. Six months later, they again reported their depressive symptoms. Participants with higher RSA reported fewer depressive symptoms six months later, but only under conditions of high social support. The interaction between RSA and social support in predicting depressive symptoms was fully mediated by social engagement. These findings provide crucial support for the idea that cardiac vagal control contributes to decreased depressive symptoms via social processes. Implications for biological sensitivity to context and differential susceptibility theories as well as for the prevention and treatment of depression are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether psychological factors are associated with heart rate variability (HRV), blood pressure variability (BPV), and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) among healthy middle-aged men and women. Methods: A population-based sample of 71 men and 79 women (35-64 years of age) was studied. Five-minute supine recordings of ECG and beat-to-beat photoplethysmographic finger systolic arterial pressure and diastolic arterial pressure were obtained during paced breathing. Power spectra were computed using a fast Fourier transform for low-frequency (0.04-0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (0.15-0.40 Hz) powers. BRS was calculated by cross-spectral analysis of R-R interval and systolic arterial pressure variabilities. Psychological factors were evaluated by three self-report questionnaires: the Brief Symptom Inventory, the shortened version of the Spielberger State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory, and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. Results: Psychological factors were not related to HRV. Anxiety was associated with decreased BRS (p = 0.001) and higher low-frequency (p = 0.002) power of systolic arterial pressure variability. These associations were independent of age, gender, other psychological factors, heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Hostility was an independent correlate of increased low-frequency power of diastolic arterial pressure (p = 0.001) and increased high-frequency power of systolic arterial pressure (p = 0.033) variability. Conclusions: Anxiety and hostility are related to reduced BRS and increased low-frequency power of BPV. Reduced BRS reflects decreased parasympathetic outflow to the heart and may increase BPV through an increased sympathetic predominance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute mental stress evokes responses in the cardiovascular and the immune systems. In particular, the subset of natural killer (NK) cells is found to be responsive to mental stress. The role of beta-adrenergic mechanisms in these processes in the subject of this investigation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Healthy male volunteers (n = 31) were subjected to two consecutive mental tasks. Subjects were randomly assigned to a beta-blocker (propranolol 40 mg) or a placebo group. The capsules were ingested 1 hour before the tasks. The tasks evoked sympathetic responses, as indicated by an increase in heart rate and a decrease in the preejection period. These effects were abolished under beta-blockade, indicating that effective beta-blockade was achieved. In the immune system, significant increases were found for the number of NK cells and NK cell activity in the placebo group; these increases were absent in the propranolol group. In addition, an increase in all lymphocyte subsets was observed in subjects who had ingested propranolol. This increase, however, was also observed in subjects who had received propranolol but had not performed the tasks, indicating that these non-subset-specific increases in lymphocytes were a side effect of the beta-blocker. CONCLUSIONS: Mental stress induces activation of the sympathetic nervous system, with concomitant increases in the number of NK cells in the circulation. These changes were inhibited by propranolol, indicating that stress-induced increases in the number and activity of NK cells in the circulation are controlled by a beta-adrenergic mechanism.},

abstract = {Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been linked to increased morbidity. An inflexibility of the autonomic nervous system might be the underlying mechanism. We aimed to assess whether PTSD and combat trauma exposure are associated with lower heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function and a predictor of death. Methods: We measured HRV by power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram in 459 middle-aged veteran male twins. Combat trauma was assessed with the combat exposure scale, and current and remitted PTSD was assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders. Mixed-effects regression models were used to test associations of PTSD and HRV between and within twin pairs. Results: Of all twins, 211 had combat exposure, 31 had current PTSD, and 43 had remitted PTSD. Current PTSD was inversely associated with very-low-frequency and low-frequency HRV both in individual twins and within 20 pairs discordant for current PTSD. Twins with current PTSD had a 49{\%} lower low-frequency HRV than their brothers without PTSD (p{\textless}.001). Remitted PTSD was not associated with HRV. Results were robust to adjustment for depression and other risk factors. Combat exposure was inversely associated with most HRV frequencies, but this association mostly diminished after adjustment for current PTSD. Conclusion: In middle-aged veteran men, combat exposure and current PTSD are associated with measures of autonomic inflexibility previously shown to have prognostic significance. The negative health impact of combat exposure on autonomic function is mediated largely through PTSD and might reverse with remission of PTSD. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {Stressful life events are an important cause of psychopathology. Humans exposed to aversive or stressful experiences show considerable inter-individual heterogeneity in their responses. However, the majority does not develop stress-related psychiatric disorders. The dynamic processes encompassing positive and functional adaptation in the face of significant adversity have been broadly defined as resilience. Traditionally, the assessment of resilience has been confined to self-report measures, both within the general community and putative high-risk populations. Although this approach has value, it is highly susceptible to subjective bias and may not capture the dynamic nature of resilience, as underlying construct. Recognizing the obvious benefits of more objective measures of resilience, research in the field has just started investigating the predictive value of several potential biological markers. This review provides an overview of theoretical views and empirical evidence suggesting that individual differences in heart rate variability (HRV), a surrogate index of resting cardiac vagal outflow, may underlie different levels of resilience toward the development of stress-related psychiatric disorders. Following this line of thought, recent studies describing associations between regional brain morphometric characteristics and resting state vagally-mediated HRV are summarized. Existing studies suggest that the structural morphology of the anterior cingulated cortex (ACC), particularly its cortical thickness, is implicated in the expression of individual differences in HRV. These findings are discussed in light of emerging structural neuroimaging research, linking morphological characteristics of the ACC to psychological traits ascribed to a high-resilient profile and abnormal structural integrity of the ACC to the psychophysiological expression of stress-related mental health consequences. We conclude that a multidisciplinary approach integrating brain structural imaging with HRV monitoring could offer novel perspectives about brain-body pathways in resilience and adaptation to psychological stress.},

abstract = {The physiological reaction to psychological stress, involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical and sympatho-adrenomedullary axes, is well characterized, but its link to cardiovascular disease risk is not well understood. Epidemiological data show that chronic stress predicts the occurrence of coronary heart disease (CHD). Employees who experience work-related stress and individuals who are socially isolated or lonely have an increased risk of a first CHD event. In addition, short-term emotional stress can act as a trigger of cardiac events among individuals with advanced atherosclerosis. A stress-specific coronary syndrome, known as transient left ventricular apical ballooning cardiomyopathy or stress (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy, also exists. Among patients with CHD, acute psychological stress has been shown to induce transient myocardial ischemia and long-term stress can increase the risk of recurrent CHD events and mortality. Applications of the 'stress concept' (the understanding of stress as a risk factor and the use of stress management) in the clinical settings have been relatively limited, although the importance of stress management is highlighted in European guidelines for cardiovascular disease prevention. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Objective: A meta-analysis of over 25 years of research into the relationship between post-myocardial infarction (MI) depression and cardiac prognosis was conducted to investigate changes in this association over time and to investigate subgroup effects. Method: A systematic literature search was performed (Medline, Embase and PsycINFO; 1975-2011) without language restrictions. Studies investigating the impact of post-MI depression on cardiovascular outcome, defined as all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality and cardiac events within 24 months after the index MI, were identified. Depression had to be assessed within 3 months after MI using established instruments. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using a random effects model. Results: A total of 29 studies were identified, resulting in 41 comparisons. Follow-up (on average 16 months) was described for 16,889 MI patients. Post-MI depression was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality [(OR), 2.25; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.73-2.93; P{\textless}.001], cardiac mortality (OR, 2.71; 95{\%} CI, 1.68-4.36; P{\textless}.001) and cardiac events (OR, 1.59; 95{\%} CI, 1.37-1.85; P{\textless}.001). ORs proved robust in subgroup analyses but declined over the years for cardiac events. Conclusions: Post-MI depression is associated with a 1.6- to 2.7-fold increased risk of impaired outcomes within 24 months.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Coronary microvascular dysfunction may contribute to myocardial ischemia during mental stress (MS). However, the role of coronary epicardial and microvascular function in regulating coronary blood flow (CBF) responses during MS remains understudied. We hypothesized that coronary vasomotion during MS is dependent on the coronary microvascular endothelial function and will be reflected in the peripheral microvascular circulation. METHODS AND RESULTS In 38 patients aged 59Â±8 years undergoing coronary angiography, endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent coronary epicardial and microvascular responses were measured using intracoronary acetylcholine and nitroprusside, respectively, and after MS induced by mental arithmetic testing. Peripheral microvascular tone during MS was measured using peripheral arterial tonometry (Itamar Inc, Caesarea, Israel) as the ratio of digital pulse wave amplitude compared to rest (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio). MS increased the rate-pressure product by 22{\%} (Â±23{\%}) and constricted epicardial coronary arteries by -5.9{\%} (-10.5{\%}, -2.6{\%}) (median [interquartile range]), P=0.001, without changing CBF. Acetylcholine increased CBF by 38.5{\%} (8.1{\%}, 91.3{\%}), P=0.001, without epicardial coronary diameter change (0.1{\%} [-10.9{\%}, 8.2{\%}], P=not significant). The MS-induced CBF response correlated with endothelium-dependent CBF changes with acetylcholine (r=0.38, P=0.03) but not with the response to nitroprusside. The peripheral arterial tonometry ratio also correlated with the demand-adjusted change in CBF during MS (r=-0.60, P=0.004), indicating similarity between the microcirculatory responses to MS in the coronary and peripheral microcirculation. CONCLUSIONS The coronary microvascular response to MS is determined by endothelium-dependent, but not endothelium-independent, coronary microvascular function. Moreover, the coronary microvascular responses to MS are reflected in the peripheral microvascular circulation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies have found that depression is an independent predictor of poor outcome after the onset of clinical coronary artery disease. There are few data concerning depression as a risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine if clinical depression is an independent risk factor for incident coronary artery disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Johns Hopkins Precursors Study is a prospective, observational study of 1190 male medical students who were enrolled between 1948 and 1964 and who continued to be followed up. In medical school and through the follow-up period, information was collected on family history, health behaviors, and clinical depression. Cardiovascular disease end points have been assessed with reviews of annual questionnaires, National Death Index searches, medical records, death certificates, and autopsy reports. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of clinical depression in the medical students at 40 years of follow-up was 12{\%}. Men who developed clinical depression drank more coffee than those who did not but did not differ in terms of baseline blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, smoking status, physical activity, obesity, or family history of coronary artery disease. In multivariate analysis, the men who reported clinical depression were at significantly greater risk for subsequent coronary heart disease (relative risk [RR], 2.12; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.24-3.63) and myocardial infarction (RR, 2.12; 95{\%} CI, 1.11-4.06). The increased risk associated with clinical depression was present even for myocardial infarctions occurring 10 years after the onset of the first depressive episode (RR, 2.1; 95{\%} CI, 1.1-4.0). CONCLUSION: Clinical depression appears to be an independent risk factor for incident coronary artery disease for several decades after the onset of the clinical depression.},

abstract = {Context: Major depressive disorder (MDD) associated with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) increases the risk of mortality. Decreased heart rate variability (HRV), also a predictor of mortality, is reduced in patients with MDD after ACS, and has been suggested to be a mediator of MDD mortality after ACS. Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may reduce mortality post-ACS, little is known about their effects on HRV. Objective: To examine the influence of both sertraline and improvement in mood on HRV. Methods: The Sertraline Antidepressant Heart Attack Randomized Trial assessed HRV from 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram recordings at baseline in 290 patients and from a second recording in 258 of these patients 16 weeks after randomization to sertraline or placebo. Frequency domain measures of HRV included high-frequency power, low-frequency power, very low-frequency power, ultra low-frequency power, and total power. Depression severity was measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Clinical response was measured with the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement scale. Results: At baseline, prior episodes of MDD were associated with lower HRV. Sertraline significantly increased ultra low-frequency power, while improvement in mood was associated with higher low-frequency power independent of treatment. However, the expected recovery in HRV following ACS was not observed in patients with MDD. Higher ultra low-frequency during sertraline treatment and higher low-frequency power in patients whose mood improved resulted primarily from these measures decreasing in their comparison groups. Conclusions: Heart rate variability recovery is impaired in depressed patients after ACS. Previously reported differences in baseline HRV between patients with and without depression after ACS grew larger in the 16 weeks following a coronary event. Both sertraline treatment and symptomatic recovery from depression were associated with increased HRV compared with placebotreated and nonrecovered post-ACS control groups, respectively, but this results primarily from decreased HRV in the comparison groups.},

abstract = {Objective: This study examines how the social environment is related to allostatic load (AL), a multisystem index of biological risk. Method: A national sample of adults (N = 949) aged 34-84 rated their relationships with spouse, family, and friends at 2 time points 10 years apart. At the second time point, participants completed a biological protocol in which indices of autonomic, hypothalamicpituitary- adrenal axis, cardiovascular, inflammatory, and metabolic function were obtained and used to create an AL summary score. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the associations among 3 aspects of social relationships-social support, social negativity, and frequency of social contact-and AL. Results: Higher levels of spouse negativity, family negativity, friend contact, and network level contact were each associated with higher AL, and higher levels of spouse support were associated with lower AL, independent of age, sociodemographic factors, and health covariates. Tests for age interactions suggested that friend support and network support were each associated with higher AL among older adults, but at younger ages there appeared to be no association between friend support and AL and a negative association between network support and AL. For network negativity, there was a marginal interaction such that network negativity was associated with higher AL among younger adults but there was no association among older adults. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that structural and functional aspects of the social environment are associated with AL, and extend previous work by demonstrating that these associations vary based on the type of relationship assessed and by age.},

Numerical and thematic analysis was used to summarize study findings. Results In clinical populations of either depression or anxiety, HRV was lower compared to controls. In non-clinical populations of either depression or anxiety, HRV was found to be lower in those who reported more depression or anxiety symptoms. Limitations The quality of the reviewed articles was not assessed which limits the ability to generate conclusions regarding study findings. Conclusion Changes in HRV were found across the spectrum of clinical and non-clinical populations of young people with depression or anxiety. Neurophysiological research on depression and anxiety in young people can act as a first step to understanding how physiological flexibility (i.e. HRV) is related to psychological flexibility (i.e. adaptive or maladaptive responses to life events).},

abstract = {Background: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is associated with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, yet the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We measured the inflammatory response to acute laboratory mental stress in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and its association with MSIMI. We hypothesized that patients with MSIMI would have a higher inflammatory response to mental stress in comparison to those without ischemia. Methods: Patients with stable CAD underwent 99mTc sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging during mental stress testing using a public speaking stressor. MSIMI was determined as impaired myocardial perfusion using a 17-segment model. Inflammatory markers including interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) and high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured at rest and 90 min after mental stress. Results were validated in an independent sample of 228 post-myocardial infarction patients. Results: Of 607 patients analyzed in this study, (mean age 63 Â± 9 years, 76{\%} male), 99 (16.3{\%}) developed MSIMI. Mental stress resulted in a significant increase in IL-6, MCP-1, and MMP-9 (all p {\textless}0.0001), but not hsCRP. However, the changes in these markers were similar in those with and without MSIMI. Neither resting levels of these biomarkers, nor their changes with mental stress were significantly associated with MSIMI. Results in the replication sample were similar. Conclusion: Mental stress is associated with acute increases in several inflammatory markers. However, neither the baseline inflammatory status nor the magnitude of the inflammatory response to mental stress over 90 min were significantly associated with MSIMI.},

The aim of this study was to determine whether brief episodes of anger trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction (MI), acute coronary syndromes (ACS), ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, and ventricular arrhythmia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a systematic review of studies evaluating whether outbursts of anger are associated with the short-term risk of heart attacks, strokes, and disturbances in cardiac rhythm that occur in everyday life. We performed a literature search of the CINAHL, Embase, PubMed, and PsycINFO databases from January 1966 to June 2013 and reviewed the reference lists of retrieved articles and included meeting abstracts and unpublished results from experts in the field. Incidence rate ratios and 95{\%} confidence intervals were calculated with inverse-variance-weighted random-effect models. The systematic review included nine independent case-crossover studies of anger outbursts and MI/ACS (four studies), ischaemic stroke (two studies), ruptured intracranial aneurysm (one study), and ventricular arrhythmia (two studies). There was evidence of substantial heterogeneity between the studies (I(2) = 92.5{\%} for MI/ACS and 89.8{\%} for ischaemic stroke). Despite the heterogeneity, all studies found that, compared with other times, there was a higher rate of cardiovascular events in the 2h following outbursts of anger.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: There is a higher risk of cardiovascular events shortly after outbursts of anger.},

Results from longitudinal cohort studies converge in illustrating that major depressive disorder (MDD) subsequently increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with about 80{\%}. The impact of MDD on cardiovascular health may be partly explained by mediating mechanisms such as unhealthy lifestyle (smoking, excessive alcohol use, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, therapy non-compliance) and unfavorable pathophysiological disturbances (autonomic, HPA-axis, metabolic and immuno-inflammatory dysregulations). A summary of the literature findings as well as relevant results from the large-scale Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (N = 2981) are presented. Persons with MDD have significantly worse lifestyles as well as more pathophysiological disturbances as compared to healthy controls. Some of these differences seem to be specific for (typical versus âatypical', or antidepressant treated versus drug-naive) subgroups of MDD patients. Alternative explanations are also present, namely undetected confounding, iatrogenic effects or âthird factors' such as genetics.},

The hypothesis was that depressed patients with CAD would have a higher prevalence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) than nondepressed patients with CAD. patients and methods: One hundred three patients who were found to have significant CAD by elective diagnostic cardiac catheterization were administered a standardized psychiatric interview and underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring. results: Twenty-one patients (20{\%}) met the criteria for either major or minor depression. There were no significant differences between depressed and nondepressed patients with CAD in severity of CAD or in ventricular function. Five (23.8{\%}) of the depressed patients and three (3.7{\%}) of the nondepressed patients exhibited episodes of VT during 24 hours of Holter monitoring (p {\textless}0.008). This difference remained significant even after controlling for relevant covariates. conclusions: We conclude that there is a higher prevalence of VT among patients with CAD and depression than among those CAD patients without depression.

abstract = {Background Chronic stress frequently manifests with anxiety and/or depressive symptomatology and may have detrimental cardiometabolic effects over time. As such, recognising the potential links between stress-related psychological disorders and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is becoming increasingly important in cardiovascular epidemiology research. The primary aim of this study was to explore prospectively potential associations between clinically relevant depressive symptomatology and anxiety levels and the 10-year CVD incidence among apparently healthy Greek adults. Design A population-based, health and nutrition prospective survey. Methods In the context of the ATTICA Study (2002-2012), 853 adult participants without previous CVD history (453 men (45+/-13 years) and 400 women (44+/-18 years)) underwent psychological evaluations through validated, self-reporting depression and anxiety questionnaires. Results After adjustment for multiple established CVD risk factors, both reported depression and anxiety levels were positively and independently associated with the 10-year CVD incidence, with depression markedly increasing the CVD risk by approximately fourfold (adjusted odds ratio (95{\%} confidence interval) 3.6 (1.3, 11) for depression status; 1.03 (1.0, 1.1) for anxiety levels). Conclusions Our findings indicate that standardised psychological assessments focusing on depression and anxiety should be considered as an additional and distinct aspect in the context of CVD preventive strategies that are designed and implemented by health authorities at the general population level.},

abstract = {Animal studies demonstrate that maternal touch and contact regulate infant stress, and handling during periods of maternal deprivation attenuates the stress response. To measure the effects of touch on infant stress reactivity during simulated maternal deprivation, 53 dyads were tested in two paradigms: still-face (SF) and still-face with maternal touch (SF+T). Maternal and infant cortisol levels were sampled at baseline, reactivity, and recovery and mother's and infant's cardiac vagal tone were measured during the free play, still-face, and reunion episodes of the procedure. Cortisol reactivity was higher among infants in the SF condition and while cortisol decreased at recovery for infants in the SF+T, it further increased for those in the SF. Vagal tone showed a greater suppression when SF was not accompanied by maternal touch. Touch synchrony during free play was associated with higher infant vagal tone, whereas touch myssynchrony - maternal tactile stimulation while the infant gaze averts - correlated with higher maternal and infant cortisol. In humans, as in mammals, the provision of touch during moments of maternal unavailability reduces infants' physiological reactivity to stress. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors.

abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with increased risk of multiple medical problems including myocardial infarction. However, a direct link between PTSD and atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) has not been made. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is an excellent method to detect atherosclerosis. This study investigated the association of PTSD to atherosclerotic CAD and mortality. Six hundred thirty-seven veterans without known CAD (61 Â± 9 years of age, 12.2{\%} women) underwent CAC scanning for clinical indications and their psychological health status (PTSD vs non-PTSD) was evaluated. In subjects with PTSD, CAC was more prevalent than in the non-PTSD cohort (76.1{\%} vs 59{\%}, p = 0.001) and their CAC scores were significantly higher in each Framingham risk score category compared to the non-PTSD group. Multivariable generalized linear regression analysis identified PTSD as an independent predictor of presence and extent of atherosclerotic CAD (p {\textless}0.01). During a mean follow-up of 42 months, the death rate was higher in the PTSD compared to the non-PTSD group (15, 17.1{\%}, vs 57, 10.4{\%}, p = 0.003). Multivariable survival regression analyses revealed a significant linkage between PTSD and mortality and between CAC and mortality. After adjustment for risk factors, relative risk (RR) of death was 1.48 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.03 to 2.91, p = 0.01) in subjects with PTSD and CAC score {\textgreater}0 compared to subjects without PTSD and CAC score equal to 0. With a CAC score equal to 0, risk of death was not different between subjects with and without PTSD (RR 1.04, 95{\%} CI 0.67 to 6.82, p = 0.4). Risk of death in each CAC category was higher in subjects with PTSD compared to matched subjects without PTSD (RRs 1.23 for CAC scores 1 to 100, 1.51 for CAC scores 101 to 400, and 1.81 for CAC scores {\textless}400, p {\textless}0.05 for all comparisons). In conclusion, PTSD is associated with presence and severity of coronary atherosclerosis and predicts mortality independent of age, gender, and conventional risk factors. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between depression and heart rate variability in cardiac patients. Methods: Heart rate variability was measured during 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring in 40 medically stable out-patients with documented coronary heart disease meeting current diagnostic criteria for major depression, and 32 nondepressed, but otherwise comparable, patients. Patients discontinued $\beta$-blockers and antidepressant medications at the time of study. Depressed patients were classified as mildly (n = 21) or moderately-to-severely depressed (n = 19) on the basis of Beck Depression Inventory scores. Results: There were no significant differences among the groups in age, gender, blood pressure, history of myocardial infarction, diabetes, or smoking. Heart rates were higher and nearly all indices of heart rate variability were significantly reduced in the moderately-to-severely versus the nondepressed group. Heart rates were also higher and mean values for heart rate variability lower in the mildly depressed group compared with the nondepressed group, but these differences did not attain statistical significance. Conclusion: The association of moderate to severe depression with reduced heart rate variability in patients with stable coronary heart disease may reflect altered cardiac autonomic modulation and may explain their increased risk for mortality.

We hypothesized that younger, but not older, women with stable CHD are more likely than their male peers to develop mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI). METHODS AND RESULTS We studied 686 patients (191 women) with stable coronary heart disease (CHD). Patients underwent (99m)Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest and with both mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) stress testing. We compared quantitative (by automated software) and visual parameters of inducible ischemia between women and men and assessed age as an effect modifier. Women had a more-adverse psychosocial profile than men whereas there were few differences in medical history and CHD risk factors. Both quantitative and visual indicators of ischemia with mental stress were disproportionally larger in younger women. For each 10 years of decreasing age, the total reversibility severity score with mental stress was 9.6 incremental points higher (interaction, P{\textless}0.001) and the incidence of MSIMI was 82.6{\%} higher (interaction, P=0.004) in women than in men. Incidence of MSIMI in women â¤50 years was almost 4-fold higher than in men of similar age and older patients. These results persisted when adjusting for sociodemographic and medical risk factors, psychosocial factors, and medications. There were no significant sex differences in inducible ischemia with conventional stress. CONCLUSIONS Young women with stable CHD are susceptible to MSIMI, which could play a role in the prognosis of this group.},

Method: In a multicentre randomised controlled trial, 2177 myocardial infarction patients were evaluated for ICD-10 depression and randomised to intervention (n=209) or care as usual (n=122). Both arms were evaluated at 18 months post-myocardial infarction for long-term depression status and new cardiac events. Results: No differences were observed between intervention and control groups in mean scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (11.0, s.d.=7.5 v. 10.2, s.d.=5.1, P=0.45) or presence of ICD-10 depression (30.5 v. 32.1{\%}, P=0.68).The cardiac event rate was 14{\%} among the intervention group and 13{\%} among controls (OR=1.07,95{\%} CI 0.57-2.00). Conclusions: Antidepressant treatment did not alter long-term depression post-myocardial infarction status or improve cardiac prognosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression is associated with increased risk of death among patients with coronary disease. Cardiovascular autonomic dysregulation may be one of the mechanisms by which depression exerts its effects on cardiovascular function. The purpose of this study was to determine whether depressive symptoms are associated with low heart rate variability (HRV) and prolonged HR recovery after exercise testing in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: The Psychophysiological Investigation of Myocardial Ischemia (PIMI) was a large, multicenter study designed to assess psychological and physiological correlates of stress in patients with CAD. One hundred and eighty-eight patients with CAD as evidenced by at least 50{\%} blockage of one major artery and a previous positive exercise stress test were included in this study. Patients included in this report were not taking beta blockers. Cardiovascular functioning was assessed by a modified Bruce protocol treadmill stress test. Measures of psychological functioning, including the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), were also obtained. RESULTS: BDI scores were negatively correlated with HR recovery (r = -0.15, p = .04). Depression scores accounted for 3.5{\%} of the variance in HR recovery when controlling for participant age (p {\textless} .01). Depressive symptoms were related to two HRV indices (ultra-low frequency, high frequency). CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms are associated with cardiovascular autonomic nervous system dysfunction as assessed by HR recovery. This relationship is not merely due to an association of depression severity with beta blocker usage or a failure of depressed patients to achieve an adequate chronotropic response.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Depression is a risk factor for mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), possibly as a result of altered autonomic nervous system (ANS) modulation of heart rate (HR) and rhythm. The purposes of this study were to determine: a) whether depressed patients are more likely to have an abnormal HR response (i.e., abnormal turbulence) to premature ventricular contractions (VPCs), and b) whether abnormal HR turbulence accounts for the effect of depression on increased mortality after AMI. METHODS Ambulatory electrocardiographic data were obtained from 666 (316 depressed, 350 nondepressed) patients with a recent AMI; 498 had VPCs with measurable HR turbulence. Of these, 260 had normal, 152 had equivocal, and 86 had abnormal HR turbulence. Patients were followed for up to 30 (median = 24) months. RESULTS Depressed patients were more likely to have abnormal HR turbulence (risk factor adjusted odds ratio = 1.8; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.0-3.0; p = .03) and have worse survival (odds ratio = 2.4; 95{\%} CI = 1.2-4.6; p = .02) than nondepressed patients. When HR turbulence was added to the model, the adjusted hazard ratio for depression decreased to 1.9 (95{\%} CI = 0.9-3.8; p = .08), and to 1.6 (95{\%} CI = 0.8-3.4; p = .18) when a measure of HR variability (LnVLF) was added. The hazard was found to differ over time with depression posing little risk for mortality in year 1 but greater risk in years 2 and 3 of the follow up. CONCLUSION ANS dysregulation may partially mediate the increased risk for mortality in depressed patients with frequent VPCs after an AMI.},

Although definitions vary, most include both tangible components (e.g., financial assistance and physical aid) and intangible components (e.g., encouragement and guidance). Social support has been implicated in the mediation of stressful life events, recovery from illness, and increased program adherence. There are many inconsistent findings in the literature, however, and it is difficult to resolve discrepancies because measures of social support vary widely from study to study. To guide in the selection of measurement methods for research and applied work, 23 techniques for assessing social support are reviewed and evaluated. Criteria for favorable evaluation included reliability coefficients greater than .8 and documentation of validity. Correlations between various social support and criterion measures are simulated in order to demonstrate the consequences of choosing a measure with low reliability. Scale developers reported reliability data for 19 of the reviewed measures. Internal consistency coefficients ranged from .31 to .98. Test-retest coefficients ranged from .22 to .96. At least some validity documentation was available for 13 of the scales. Discriminant validity evidence, however, is almost universally absent. Despite psychometric weaknesses and variability among the scales, researchers have several instruments available to them.},

abstract = {Background-Among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), depression is both common and underrecognized. The association of different manifestations of depression, somatic and cognitive, with depression recognition and long-term prognosis is poorly understood. Methods and Results-Depression was confirmed in 481 AMI patients enrolled from 21 sites during their index hospitalization with a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score â¥10. Within the PHQ-9, separate somatic and cognitive symptom scores were derived, and the independent association between these domains and the clinical recognition of depression, as documented in the medical records, was evaluated. In a separate multisite AMI registry of 2347 patients, the association between somatic and cognitive depressive symptoms and 4-year all-cause mortality and 1-year all-cause rehospitalization was evaluated. Depression was clinically recognized in 29{\%} (n=140) of patients. Cognitive depressive symptoms (relative risk per SD increase, 1.14; 95{\%} CI, 1.03 to 1.26; Pâ¥0.01) were independently associated with depression recognition, whereas the association for somatic symptoms and recognition (relative risk, 1.04; 95{\%} CI, 0.87 to 1.26; P=0.66) was not significant. However, unadjusted Cox regression analyses found that only somatic depressive symptoms were associated with 4-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR] per SD increase, 1.22; 95{\%} CI, 1.08 to 1.39) or 1-year rehospitalization (HR, 1.22; 95{\%} CI, 1.11 to 1.33), whereas cognitive manifestations were not (HR for mortality, 1.01; 95{\%} CI, 0.89 to 1.14; HR for rehospitalization, 1.01; 95{\%} CI, 0.93 to 1.11). After multivariable adjustment, the association between somatic symptoms and rehospitalization persisted (HR, 1.16; 95{\%} CI, 1.06 to 1.27; P=0.01) but was attenuated for mortality (HR, 1.07; 95{\%} CI, 0.94 to 1.21; P=0.30). Conclusions-Depression after AMI was recognized in fewer than 1 in 3 patients. Although cognitive symptoms were associated with recognition of depression, somatic symptoms were associa ed with long-term outcomes. Comprehensive screening and treatment of both somatic and cognitive symptoms may be necessary to optimize depression recognition and treatment in AMI patients.

abstract = {Background: Studies have linked depression to sudden death and serious cardiovascular events in patients with preexisting cardiac illness. Recent studies have shown decreased vagal function in cardiac patients with depression and depressed patients without cardiac illness. Methods: We compared 20-hour, sleeping, and awake heart period variability measures using spectral analysis, fractal dimension, and symbolic dynamics in two patient groups with major depression and ischemic heart disease (mean age 59-60 years) before and after 6 weeks of paroxetine or nortriptyline treatment. Results: Spectral measures showed decreases in awake and sleeping total power (TP: 0.0-0.5 Hz), ultra low frequency power (ULF: 0-0.0033 Hz), very low frequency power (VLF: 0.0033-0.04 Hz), and low-frequency power (LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz) for nortriptyline condition and a decrease in high-frequency power (HF: 0.15-0.5 Hz) for the awake condition in patients who received nortriptyline. A measure of nonlinear complexity, WC-100, significantly increased after paroxetine during the awake condition. Conclusions: These findings suggest that nortriptyline has stronger vagolytic effects on cardiac autonomic function compared with paroxetine, which is in agreement with previous clinical and preclinical reports. Paroxetine may have some cardio-protective effects, especially in cardiac patients. {\textcopyright} 2002 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

Proneness to anger, as assessed by the Spielberger Trait Anger Scale, is composed of two distinct subcomponents - anger-temperament and anger-reaction. Participants were 12,990 middle-aged Black men and women and White men and women from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study who were followed for the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction (MI)/fatal CHD, silent MI, or cardiac revascularization procedures (average = 53 months; maximum = 72 months) through December 31, 1995. Among normotensive persons, a strong, angry temperament (tendency toward quick, minimally provoked, or unprovoked anger) was associated with combined CHD (acute MI/fatal CHD, silent MI, or cardiac revascularization procedures) (multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio = 2.10, 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.34, 3.29) and with "hard" events (acute MI/fatal CHD) (multivariate adjusted hazard ratio = 2.28, 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.29, 4.02). CHD event-free survival among normotensives who had a strong, angry temperament was not significantly different from that of hypertensives at either level of anger. These data suggest that a strong, angry temperament rather than anger in reaction to criticism, frustration, or unfair treatment places normotensive, middle-aged persons at increased risk for cardiac events and may confer a CHD risk similar to that of hypertension.},

abstract = {Background: The pathophysiology of mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia, which occurs, at lower heart rates than during physical stress, is not well understood. Methods and Results: The Psychophysiological Investigations of Myocardial Ischemia Study (PIMI) evaluated the physiological and neuroendocrine functioning in unmedicated patients with stable coronary artery disease and exercise-induced ischemia. Hemodynamic and neurohormonal responses to bicycle exercise, public speaking, and the Stroop test were measured by radionuclide ventriculography, ECG, and blood pressure and catecholamine monitoring. With mental stress, there were increases in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance that were correlated with increases in plasma epinephrine. During exercise, systemic vascular resistance fell, and there was no relationship between the hemodynamic changes and epinephrine levels. The fall in ejection fraction was greater with mental stress than exercise. During mental stress, the changes in election fraction were inversely correlated with the changes in systemic vascular resistance. Evidence for myocardial ischemia was present in 92{\%} of patients during bicycle exercise and in 58{\%} of patients during mental stress. Greater increases in plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine occurred with ischemia during exercise, and greater increases in systemic vascular resistance occurred with ischemia during mental stress. Conclusions: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is associated with a significant increase in systemic vascular resistance and a relatively minor increase in heart rate and rate-pressure product compared with ischemia induced by exercise. These hemodynamic responses to mental stress can be mediated by the adrenal secretion of epinephrine. The pathophysiological mechanisms involved are important in the understanding of the etiology of myocardial ischemia and perhaps in the selection of appropriate anti-ischemic therapy.},

abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is prevalent. Although standards antidepressants are more effective than placebo, up to 35{\%} of patients do not respond to 4 or more conventional treatments and are considered to have treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Considerable effort has been devoted to trying to find effective treatments for TRD. This review focuses on vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), approved for TRD in 2005 by the Food and Drugs Administration. Stimulation is carried by bipolar electrodes on the left cervical vagus nerve, which are attached to an implanted stimulator generator. The vagus bundle contains about 80{\%} of afferent fibers terminating in the medulla, from which there are projections to many areas of brain, including the limbic forebrain. Various types of brain imaging studies reveal widespread functional effects in brain after either acute or chronic VNS. Although more randomized control trials of VNS need to be carried out before a definitive conclusion can be reached about its efficacy, the results of open studies, carried out over period of 1 to 2 years, show much more efficacy when compared with results from treatment as usual studies. There is an increase in clinical response to VNS between 3 and 12 months, which is quite different from that seen with standard antidepressant treatment of MDD. Preclinically, VNS affects many of the same brain areas, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine) and signal transduction mechanisms (brain-derived neurotrophic factorâtropomyosin receptor kinase B) as those found with traditional antidepressants. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which VNS benefits patients nonresponsive to conventional antidepressants is unclear, with further research needed to clarify this.},

abstract = {Mental stress-induced ischemia approximately doubles the risk of cardiac events in patients with coronary artery disease, yet the mechanisms underlying changes in coronary blood flow in response to mental stress are poorly characterized. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) regulates basal coronary blood flow in healthy humans and mediates mental stress-induced vasodilation in the forearm. However, its possible role in mental stress-induced increases in coronary blood flow is unknown. We studied 11 patients (6 men and 5 women, mean age: 58 Â± 14 yr) undergoing elective diagnostic cardiac catheterization and assessed the vasodilator response to mental stress elicited by the Stroop color-word test. Intracoronary substance P (20 pmol/min) and isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg) were used to assess endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation, respectively. Coronary blood flow was estimated using intracoronary Doppler recordings and quantitative coronary angiography to measure coronary artery diameter. Mental stress increased coronary flow by 34 Â± 7.0{\%} over the preceding baseline during saline infusion (P {\textless} 0.01), and this was reduced to 26 Â± 7.0{\%} in the presence of the selective nNOS inhibitor S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline (0.625 Âµmol/min, P {\textless} 0.001). Mental stress increased coronary artery diameter by 6.9 Â± 3.7{\%} (P = 0.02) and 0.5 Â± 2.8{\%} (P = 0.51) in the presence of S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline. The response to substance P did not predict the response to mental stress (r(2) = -0.22, P = 0.83). nNOS mediates the human coronary vasodilator response to mental stress, predominantly through actions at the level of coronary resistance vessels.NEW {\&} NOTEWORTHY Acute mental stress induces vasodilation of the coronary microvasculature.

Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: 12 681 white and African-American participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and two ancillary studies. Methods: Participants provided information on SES and place of residence in childhood and young (30-40 years) and mature (45+) adulthood. Residences were linked to census data for neighbourhood SES information. Multiple imputation (MI) was used for missing data. Linear regression and adjusted geometric means were used to estimate the effects of SES on inflammatory risk marker levels. Results: Graded, statistically significant associations were observed between greater cumulative life-course exposure to low education and social class and elevated levels of fibrinogen and WBC among white participants. Stronger graded, statistically significant associations were observed between low adult education, social class and neighbourhood SES and elevated inflammatory levels. Associations were weaker and less consistent in African-Americans. Covariate adjustment attenuated results but many associations remained strong. Conclusions: Our results suggest that cumulative exposure to adverse SES conditions across the life course and low adult SES are associated with an elevated systemic inflammatory burden in adulthood. Chronic systemic inflammation may be one pathway linking low life-course SES and elevated cardiovascular disease risk.},

The mean correlations of the BDI samples with clinical ratings and the HRSD were 0. 72 and 0.73, respectively, for psychiatric patients. With nonpsychiatric subjects, the mean correlations of the BDI with clinical ratings and the HRSD were 0.60 and 0.74, respectively. Recent evidence indicates that the BDI discriminates subtypes of depression and differentiates depression from anxiety. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Depression is an established risk factor for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), with an impact on cardiac prognosis; nonetheless, the literature disagrees on the role played by anxiety. No study has evaluated this relationship in a cardiac population with no history of depression and after their first diagnosis of ACS. The aim of this study is to explore these associations without the confounding role of long-lasting heart disease or psychiatric illnesses. METHOD Two hundred sixty-six patients with no history of depression completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorder at baseline and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months follow-up after their first diagnosis of ACS. During the follow-up period, we collected information regarding the major adverse cardiac events. RESULTS Developing a first-ever depressive episode, in a proportional hazard model, was associated with almost 3 times the risk of a recurrent cardiac event (odds ratio = 2.590, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] [1.321, 5.078], p = .006). Furthermore, a moderation analysis revealed that increasing levels of baseline anxiety had opposing effects on cardiac outcomes, being protective only in those who did not develop incident depression (B = -0.0824, 95{\%} CI [-0.164, -0.005], p = .048). No dose-response effect between depressive or anxious symptoms and cardiac outcomes emerged. CONCLUSION Our results confirm the detrimental effect of depression on cardiac prognosis in a selected population and suggest that anxiety after the first diagnosis of ACS might have different roles depending on the illness' course.

abstract = {Background: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is associated with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, yet the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We measured the inflammatory response to acute laboratory mental stress in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and its association with MSIMI. We hypothesized that patients with MSIMI would have a higher inflammatory response to mental stress in comparison to those without ischemia. Methods: Patients with stable CAD underwent 99mTc sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging during mental stress testing using a public speaking stressor. MSIMI was determined as impaired myocardial perfusion using a 17-segment model. Inflammatory markers including interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) and high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured at rest and 90 min after mental stress. Results were validated in an independent sample of 228 post-myocardial infarction patients. Results: Of 607 patients analyzed in this study, (mean age 63 Â± 9 years, 76{\%} male), 99 (16.3{\%}) developed MSIMI. Mental stress resulted in a significant increase in IL-6, MCP-1, and MMP-9 (all p {\textless}0.0001), but not hsCRP. However, the changes in these markers were similar in those with and without MSIMI. Neither resting levels of these biomarkers, nor their changes with mental stress were significantly associated with MSIMI. Results in the replication sample were similar. Conclusion: Mental stress is associated with acute increases in several inflammatory markers. However, neither the baseline inflammatory status nor the magnitude of the inflammatory response to mental stress over 90 min were significantly associated with MSIMI.},

abstract = {Both social isolation and loneliness are associated with increased mortality, but it is uncertain whether their effects are independent or whether loneliness represents the emotional pathway through which social isolation impairs health. We therefore assessed the extent to which the association between social isolation and mortality is mediated by loneliness. We assessed social isolation in terms of contact with family and friends and participation in civic organizations in 6,500 men and women aged 52 and older who took part in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing in 2004-2005. A standard questionnaire measure of loneliness was administered also. We monitored all-cause mortality up to March 2012 (mean follow-up 7.25 y) and analyzed results using Cox proportional hazards regression. We found that mortality was higher among more socially isolated and more lonely participants. However, after adjusting statistically for demographic factors and baseline health, social isolation remained significantly associated with mortality (hazard ratio 1.26, 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.08-1.48 for the top quintile of isolation), but loneliness did not (hazard ratio 0.92, 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.78-1.09). The association of social isolation with mortality was unchanged when loneliness was included in the model. Both social isolation and loneliness were associated with increased mortality. However, the effect of loneliness was not independent of demographic characteristics or health problems and did not contribute to the risk associated with social isolation. Although both isolation and loneliness impair quality of life and well-being, efforts to reduce isolation are likely to be more relevant to mortality.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the present paper, we describe a model of neurovisceral integration in which a set of neural structures involved in cognitive, affective, and autonomic regulation are related to heart rate variability (HRV) and cognitive performance. METHODS: We detail the pathways involved in the neural regulation of the cardiovascular system and provide pharmacological and neuroimaging data in support of the neural structures linking the central nervous system to HRV in humans. We review a number of studies from our group showing that individual differences in HRV are related to performance on tasks associated with executive function and prefrontal cortical activity. These studies include comparisons of executive- and nonexecutive-function tasks in healthy participants, in both threatening and nonthreatening conditions. In addition, we show that manipulating resting HRV levels is associated with changes in performance on executive-function tasks. We also examine the relationship between HRV and cognitive performance in ecologically valid situations using a police shooting simulation and a naval navigation simulation. Finally, we review our studies in anxiety patients, as well as studies examining psychopathy. CONCLUSION: These findings in total suggest an important relationship among cognitive performance, HRV, and prefrontal neural function that has important implications for both physical and mental health. Future studies are needed to determine exactly which executive functions are associated with individual differences in HRV in a wider range of situations and populations.},

abstract = {Background: Research on the etiology of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has rapidly matured, moving from candidate gene studies to interrogation of the entire human genome in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we present the results of a GWAS performed on samples from combat-exposed U.S. Marines and Sailors from the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS) scheduled for deployment to Iraq and/or Afghanistan. The MRS is a large, prospective study with longitudinal follow-up designed to identify risk and resiliency factors for combat-induced stress-related symptoms. Previously implicated PTSD risk loci from the literature and polygenic risk scores across psychiatric disorders were also evaluated in the MRS cohort. Methods: Participants (. N=. 3494) were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale and diagnosed using the DSM-IV diagnostic criterion. Subjects with partial and/or full PTSD diagnosis were called cases, all other subjects were designated controls, and study-wide maximum CAPS scores were used for longitudinal assessments. Genomic DNA was genotyped on the Illumina HumanOmniExpressExome array. Individual genetic ancestry was determined by supervised cluster analysis for subjects of European, African, Hispanic/Native American, and other descent. To test for association of SNPs with PTSD, logistic regressions were performed within each ancestry group and results were combined in meta-analyses. Measures of childhood and adult trauma were included to test for gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions. Polygenic risk scores from the Psychiatric Genomic Consortium were used for major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BPD), and schizophrenia (SCZ). Results: The array produced {\textgreater}800K directly genotyped and {\textgreater}21M imputed markers in 3494 unrelated, trauma-exposed males, of which 940 were diagnosed with partial or full PTSD. The GWAS meta-analysis identified the phosphoribosyl transferase domain containing 1 gene (PRTFDC1) as a genome-wide significant PTSD locus (rs6482463; OR=1.47, SE=0.06, p=2.04Ã10-9), with a similar effect across ancestry groups. Association of PRTFDC1 with PTSD in an independent military cohort showed some evidence for replication. Loci with suggestive evidence of association (n=25 genes, p{\textless}5Ã10-6) further implicated genes related to immune response and the ubiquitin system, but these findings remain to be replicated in larger GWASs. A replication analysis of 25 putative PTSD genes from the literature found nominally significant SNPs for the majority of these genes, but associations did not remain significant after correction for multiple comparison. A cross-disorder analysis of polygenic risk scores from GWASs of BPD, MDD, and SCZ found that PTSD diagnosis was associated with risk sores of BPD, but not with MDD or SCZ. Conclusions: This first multi-ethnic/racial GWAS of PTSD highlights the potential to increase power through meta-analyses across ancestry groups. We found evidence for PRTFDC1 as a potential novel PTSD gene, a finding that awaits further replication. Our findings indicate that the genetic architecture of PTSD may be determined by many SNPs with small effects, and overlap with other neuropsychiatric disorders, consistent with current findings from large GWAS of other psychiatric disorders.},

abstract = {Objective: A meta-analysis of over 25 years of research into the relationship between post-myocardial infarction (MI) depression and cardiac prognosis was conducted to investigate changes in this association over time and to investigate subgroup effects. Method: A systematic literature search was performed (Medline, Embase and PsycINFO; 1975-2011) without language restrictions. Studies investigating the impact of post-MI depression on cardiovascular outcome, defined as all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality and cardiac events within 24 months after the index MI, were identified. Depression had to be assessed within 3 months after MI using established instruments. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using a random effects model. Results: A total of 29 studies were identified, resulting in 41 comparisons. Follow-up (on average 16 months) was described for 16,889 MI patients. Post-MI depression was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality [(OR), 2.25; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.73-2.93; P{\textless}.001], cardiac mortality (OR, 2.71; 95{\%} CI, 1.68-4.36; P{\textless}.001) and cardiac events (OR, 1.59; 95{\%} CI, 1.37-1.85; P{\textless}.001). ORs proved robust in subgroup analyses but declined over the years for cardiac events. Conclusions: Post-MI depression is associated with a 1.6- to 2.7-fold increased risk of impaired outcomes within 24 months. This association has been relatively stable over the past 25 years. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been linked to increased morbidity. An inflexibility of the autonomic nervous system might be the underlying mechanism. We aimed to assess whether PTSD and combat trauma exposure are associated with lower heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function and a predictor of death. Methods: We measured HRV by power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram in 459 middle-aged veteran male twins. Combat trauma was assessed with the combat exposure scale, and current and remitted PTSD was assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders. Mixed-effects regression models were used to test associations of PTSD and HRV between and within twin pairs. Results: Of all twins, 211 had combat exposure, 31 had current PTSD, and 43 had remitted PTSD. Current PTSD was inversely associated with very-low-frequency and low-frequency HRV both in individual twins and within 20 pairs discordant for current PTSD. Twins with current PTSD had a 49{\%} lower low-frequency HRV than their brothers without PTSD (p{\textless}.001). Remitted PTSD was not associated with HRV. Results were robust to adjustment for depression and other risk factors. Combat exposure was inversely associated with most HRV frequencies, but this association mostly diminished after adjustment for current PTSD. Conclusion: In middle-aged veteran men, combat exposure and current PTSD are associated with measures of autonomic inflexibility previously shown to have prognostic significance. The negative health impact of combat exposure on autonomic function is mediated largely through PTSD and might reverse with remission of PTSD. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {Importance Depressive symptoms are associated with lower heart rate variability (HRV), an index of autonomic dysregulation, but the direction of the association remains unclear. Objective To investigate the temporal association between depression and HRV. Design, Settings, and Participants A longitudinal, cross-lagged twin difference study, with baseline assessments from March 2002 to March 2006 (visit 1) and a 7-year follow-up (visit 2) at an academic research center with participants recruited from a national twin registry. Twins (n = 166) from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, who served in the US military during the Vietnam War, and were discordant for depression at baseline were recruited. Main Outcomes and Measures At both visits, depressive symptoms were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and HRV was measured through 24-hour electrocardiogram monitoring. To assess the direction of the association, within-pair differences in multivariable mixed-effects regression models were examined, and standardized $\beta$ coefficients for both pathways were calculated. The associations were evaluated separately in monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Results In the final analytic sample (N = 146), all participants were men, 138 (95{\%}) were white, and the mean (SD) age was 54 (3) years at baseline. Results showed consistent associations between visit 1 HRV and visit 2 BDI score across all HRV domains and models ($\beta$ coefficients ranging from â0.14 to â0.29), which were not explained by antidepressants or other participant characteristics. The magnitude of the association was similar in the opposite pathway linking visit 1 BDI score to visit 2 HRV, with $\beta$ coefficients ranging from 0.05 to â0.30, but it was largely explained by antidepressant use. In stratified analysis by zygosity, significant associations were observed in monozygotic and dizygotic twins for the path linking visit 1 HRV to visit 2 BDI score, although the associations were slightly stronger in dizygotic twins. Conclusions and Relevance The association between depression and autonomic dysregulation, indexed by HRV, is bidirectional, with stronger evidence suggesting that autonomic function affects depression risk rather than vice versa. The opposite causal pathway from depression to lower HRV is mostly driven by antidepressant use. These findings highlight an important role of autonomic nervous system in the risk of depression and contribute new understanding of the mechanisms underlying the comorbidity of depression and cardiovascular disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression is associated with increased risk of death among patients with coronary disease. Cardiovascular autonomic dysregulation may be one of the mechanisms by which depression exerts its effects on cardiovascular function. The purpose of this study was to determine whether depressive symptoms are associated with low heart rate variability (HRV) and prolonged HR recovery after exercise testing in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: The Psychophysiological Investigation of Myocardial Ischemia (PIMI) was a large, multicenter study designed to assess psychological and physiological correlates of stress in patients with CAD. One hundred and eighty-eight patients with CAD as evidenced by at least 50{\%} blockage of one major artery and a previous positive exercise stress test were included in this study. Patients included in this report were not taking beta blockers. Cardiovascular functioning was assessed by a modified Bruce protocol treadmill stress test. Measures of psychological functioning, including the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), were also obtained. RESULTS: BDI scores were negatively correlated with HR recovery (r = -0.15, p = .04). Depression scores accounted for 3.5{\%} of the variance in HR recovery when controlling for participant age (p {\textless} .01). Depressive symptoms were related to two HRV indices (ultra-low frequency, high frequency). CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms are associated with cardiovascular autonomic nervous system dysfunction as assessed by HR recovery. This relationship is not merely due to an association of depression severity with beta blocker usage or a failure of depressed patients to achieve an adequate chronotropic response.},

abstract = {A wealth of evidence has implicated inflammation in the development of depression. Yet, the heterogeneous nature of depression has impeded efforts to understand, prevent, and treat the disease. The purpose of this integrative review is to summarize the connections between inflammation and established core features of depression that exhibit more homogeneity than the syndrome itself: exaggerated reactivity to negative information, altered reward processing, decreased cognitive control, and somatic syndrome. For each core feature, we first provide a brief overview of its relevance to depression and neurobiological underpinnings, and then review evidence investigating a potential role of inflammation. We focus primarily on findings from experimental paradigms of exogenously-induced inflammation. We conclude that inflammation likely plays a role in exaggerated reactivity to negative information, altered reward reactivity, and somatic symptoms. There is less evidence supporting an effect of inflammation on cognitive control as assessed by standard neuropsychological measures. Finally, we discuss implications for future research and recommendationsfor how to test the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of heterogeneous psychiatric disorders.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is a common phenomenon in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but contemporary studies of its prognostic significance and its underlying pathophysiology are limited. METHODS We prospectively enrolled patients with confirmed CAD in the Mental Stress Ischemia Prognosis Study (MIPS) between 2011 and 2014. All patients underwent mental stress testing using a standardized public speaking task, and ischemia was detected by Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging. Patients also underwent conventional stress testing for myocardial ischemia (CSIMI) using exercise or pharmacological stress testing. Furthermore, digital microvascular flow, endothelial function, arterial stiffness, and blood sample collections were performed before, during, and after mental stress. Two-year adverse clinical outcomes are being assessed. RESULTS Six-hundred ninety-five patients completed baseline enrollment in the MIPS. Their mean (standard deviation) age was 62.9 (9.1) years, 72{\%} were men, 30{\%} were African American, and 32{\%} had a history myocardial infarction. The prevalence of MSIMI and CSIMI is 16.1{\%} and 34.7{\%}, respectively. A total of 151 patients (22.9{\%}) had only CSIMI, 28 (4.2{\%}) had only MSIMI, and 78 (11.8{\%}) had both MSIMI and CSIMI. Patients with ischemia had a lower ejection fraction and higher prevalence of previous coronary artery bypass grafting compared with those without inducible ischemia (p {\textless} .050). The prevalence of obstructive CAD was not statistically different between patients with and without MSIMI (p = .426); in contrast, it was higher in patients with CSIMI (p {\textless} .001). CONCLUSIONS The MIPS data will provide useful information to assess the prognostic significance and underlying mechanisms of MSIMI.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To clarify the relationship between depression and heart rate variability (HRV) in a sample of twins. Reduced HRV, a measure of autonomic dysfunction, has been linked to depression but many studies have inadequately controlled for familial and environmental factors. Furthermore, little is known about whether depression and HRV share common genetic pathways.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We performed power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms in 288 middle-aged male twins. Log-normalized ultra low, very low, low, high frequency, and total power were calculated. A lifetime history of major depressive disorder (MDD) was determined, using the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders, and current depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory. Mixed-effect regression models were used to account for intrapair variability and estimate within-pair effects at the same time controlling for potential confounders.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Both current depressive symptoms and a history of MDD were significantly associated with lower HRV. There was a graded effect, and power in each frequency band was 29{\%} to 36{\%} lower in the lowest band compared with the highest BDI category. All HRV measures except high frequency remained significantly associated with current depressive symptoms in multivariable analysis, but not with lifetime history of MDD. When analyses were stratified by zygosity, a significant within-pair association between BDI score and HRV was found in the dizygotic but not in the monozygotic twins, suggesting a genetic influence on the association.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: A shared, genetically influenced biological pathway underlies the association between depression and lower HRV. These two phenotypes may be the expression of a generalized neurobiological perturbation.},

abstract = {There is growing evidence that psychosocial stress can influence the natural history of coronary heart disease.1 Epidemiological studies indicate that psychosocial factors both contribute to the development of coronary artery disease (CAD), and increase risk of cardiac dysfunction and the likelihood of cardiac events in susceptible patients with established disease.2,3 An important method of assessing effects on cardiac function is by measuring transient ischaemic responses to standardized mental stress tests. Mental stress-induced myocardial ischaemia (MSIMI) is analogous to exercise stress ischaemia, except that the stimulus is psychological rather than physical. MSIMI has been studied with a number of different imaging techniques and with a range of stressful stimuli. But several investigations have involved small numbers of patients, and the medication status of patients has been variable. This has resulted in diverse findings concerning the prevalence of MSIMI, the conditions in which it is elicited, the type of patients who are most susceptible, the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon, and its clinical significance. In an effort to clarify these issues, we have conducted a systematic review of studies in which myocardial ischaemic responses have been measured in response to standardized mental stressors in the laboratory and clinic. Relevant articles were identified from searches of PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed)between 1980 and 2002. Only articles in English language peer-reviewed publications were examined. We included studies that examined the link between standardized mental stress tests and myocardial ischaemic responses. Studies involving patients with CAD and healthy volunteers or patients without CAD were included. To ensure comprehensive data location, further searches were made for authors published in this field and review articles were used as sources. The bibliographies of all papers retrieved were hand searched to ensure as many articles as possible were obtained. A number of studies in this field have resulted in multiple publications, {\ldots}},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine in a nonclinical sample of preadolescents the possibility that somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms are differentially related with the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Depression is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Dysregulation of the ANS and the HPA axis have been proposed as underlying mechanisms. Several studies suggest that only a subset of the depression symptoms account for associations with cardiovascular prognosis. METHODS: Self-reported somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms were examined in relationship to heart rate variability (HRV), spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), and the cortisol awakening response (CAR) in 2049 preadolescents (mean age = 11.1 years; 50.7{\%} = girls) from the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS). RESULTS: Physiological measurements were not associated with the overall measure of depressive symptoms. Somatic depressive symptoms were negatively related to HRV and BRS, and positively to the CAR; cognitive-affective depressive symptoms were positively related to HRV and BRS, and negatively to the CAR. Associations with the CAR pertained to boys only. CONCLUSIONS: Somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms differ in their association with both cardiac autonomic and HPA axis function in preadolescents. Particularly, somatic depression symptoms may mark cardiac risk.},

Results from longitudinal cohort studies converge in illustrating that major depressive disorder (MDD) subsequently increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with about 80{\%}. The impact of MDD on cardiovascular health may be partly explained by mediating mechanisms such as unhealthy lifestyle (smoking, excessive alcohol use, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, therapy non-compliance) and unfavorable pathophysiological disturbances (autonomic, HPA-axis, metabolic and immuno-inflammatory dysregulations). A summary of the literature findings as well as relevant results from the large-scale Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (N = 2981) are presented. Persons with MDD have significantly worse lifestyles as well as more pathophysiological disturbances as compared to healthy controls. Some of these differences seem to be specific for (typical versus âatypical', or antidepressant treated versus drug-naive) subgroups of MDD patients. Alternative explanations are also present, namely undetected confounding, iatrogenic effects or âthird factors' such as genetics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Clinical depression is associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients with a recent myocardial infarction (MI). Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) has been suggested as a possible explanation for this association. The purpose of this study was to determine if depression is associated with reduced HRV in patients with a recent MI. METHODS AND RESULTS Three hundred eighty acute MI patients with depression and 424 acute MI patients without depression were recruited. All underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring after hospital discharge. In univariate analyses, 4 indices of HRV were significantly lower in patients with depression than in patients without depression. Variables associated with HRV were then compared between patients with and without depression, and potential confounds were identified. These variables (age, sex, diabetes, and present cigarette smoking) were entered into an analysis of covariance model, followed by depression status. In the final model, all but one HRV index (high-frequency power) remained significantly lower in patients with depression than in patients without depression. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that greater autonomic dysfunction, as reflected by decreased HRV, is a plausible mechanism linking depression to increased cardiac mortality in post-MI patients.},

We aimed to examine the association between depressive symptoms and mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia in young survivors of an MI.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We studied 98 patients (49 women and 49 men) age 38-60 years who were hospitalized for acute MI in the previous 6 months. Patients underwent myocardial perfusion imaging at rest, after mental stress (speech task), and after exercise or pharmacological stress. A summed difference score (SDS), obtained with observer-independent software, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) was used to measure depressive symptoms, which were analyzed as overall score, and as separate somatic and cognitive depressive symptom scores.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: There was a significant positive association between depressive symptoms and SDS with mental stress, denoting more ischemia. After adjustment for demographic and lifestyle factors, disease severity and medications, each incremental depressive symptom was associated with 0.14 points higher SDS. When somatic and cognitive depressive symptoms were examined separately, both somatic [$\beta$ = 0.17, 95{\%} CI: (0.04, 0.30), p = 0.01] and cognitive symptoms [$\beta$ = 0.31, 95{\%} CI: (0.07, 0.56), p = 0.01] were significantly associated with mental stress-induced ischemia.

abstract = {Context: Major depressive disorder (MDD) associated with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) increases the risk of mortality. Decreased heart rate variability (HRV), also a predictor of mortality, is reduced in patients with MDD after ACS, and has been suggested to be a mediator of MDD mortality after ACS. Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may reduce mortality post-ACS, little is known about their effects on HRV. Objective: To examine the influence of both sertraline and improvement in mood on HRV. Methods: The Sertraline Antidepressant Heart Attack Randomized Trial assessed HRV from 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram recordings at baseline in 290 patients and from a second recording in 258 of these patients 16 weeks after randomization to sertraline or placebo. Frequency domain measures of HRV included high-frequency power, low-frequency power, very low-frequency power, ultra low-frequency power, and total power. Depression severity was measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Clinical response was measured with the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement scale. Results: At baseline, prior episodes of MDD were associated with lower HRV. Sertraline significantly increased ultra low-frequency power, while improvement in mood was associated with higher low-frequency power independent of treatment. However, the expected recovery in HRV following ACS was not observed in patients with MDD. Higher ultra low-frequency during sertraline treatment and higher low-frequency power in patients whose mood improved resulted primarily from these measures decreasing in their comparison groups. Conclusions: Heart rate variability recovery is impaired in depressed patients after ACS. Previously reported differences in baseline HRV between patients with and without depression after ACS grew larger in the 16 weeks following a coronary event. Both sertraline treatment and symptomatic recovery from depression were associated with increased HRV compared with placebotreated and nonrecovered post-ACS control groups, respectively, but this results primarily from decreased HRV in the comparison groups.},

abstract = {Objectives: Cardiac repolarization may be affected by psychiatric disorders and/or antidepressant use, but evidence for this is inconclusive. This study examined the relationship between depressive and anxiety disorder and use of antidepressants with T-wave amplitude (TWA) and QT-interval. Methods: Data was obtained from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (n = 1,383). Depression/anxiety was diagnosed with the DSM-IV based Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The use of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was established. T-wave amplitude and QT-interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) were obtained from an ECG measured in a type II axis configuration. Results: Compared to controls, persons with depression or anxiety disorders did not show a significantly different TWA (p = 0.58; Cohen's d = 0.046) or QTc (p = 0.48; Cohen's d = -0.057). In spite of known sympathomimetic effects, TCA use (p = 0.26; Cohen's d = -0.162) and SNRI use (p = 0.70; Cohen's d = -0.055) were not significantly associated with a lower TWA. TCA use (p = 0.12; Cohen's d = 0.225) and SNRI use (p = 0.11; Cohen's d = 0.227) were also not significantly associated with a prolonged QTc. Conclusion: We did not find evidence that either depressive/anxiety disorder or antidepressant use is associated with abnormalities in TWA or QTc. Earlier found sympathomimetic effects of TCAs and SNRIs are not evident in these measures of cardiac repolarization.},

The mean heart rate for depressed patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) was significantly higher than for nondepressed CAD patients, independent of the patient's age, smoking status, and beta blocker therapy. Heart rate variability was lower in depressed patients but did not achieve significance. With the exception of smoking, which was more common in depressed patients, there were no significant differences between the depressed and nondepressed patients on any other medical or demographic variable assessed. It is concluded that elevated heart rate may represent increased sympathetic tone in depressed CAD patients, and may help to explain the increased morbidity and mortality reported in these patients. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

HRV is a measure of cardiac autonomic functioning. METHOD: A cross-sectional comparison of 136 elderly persons with MDD and 136 non-depressed controls (matched for age and gender) recruited in family practices in the Netherlands. Depression was determined according to the DSM-IV criteria using the PRIME-MD. HRV was measured with an electrocardiogram (ECG) during a 5-minute supine rest. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses showed statistically significant decrease in HRV in MDD patients compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Older primary care patients with MDD have a reduced HRV. This may explain why depression is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is commonly used as a quantitative marker depicting the activity of autonomous nervous system (ANS) that may be related to mental stress. For mobile applications, short term ECG measurement may be used for HRV analysis since the conventional five minute long recordings might be inadequately long. Short term analysis of HRV features has been investigated mostly in ECG data from normal and cardiac patients. Thus, short term HRV features may not have any relevance on the assessment of acute mental stress. In this study, we obtained ultra short term HRV features from 24 subjects during baseline stage and Stroop color word test. We validated these HRV features by showing significant differences in HRV features existed between the two stages. Our results indicated that ultra short term analysis of heart rate and RR intervals within 10 s, RMSSD and PNN50 within 30 s, HF within 40 s, LF/HF, normalized LF, and normalized HF within 50 s could be reliably performed for monitoring mental stress in mobile settings.},

abstract = {Heart failure (HF) is a major source of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Psychosocial factors have frequently been studied as risk factors for coronary heart disease but not for HF. Methods and Results-We examined the relationship between psychological status and incident HF among 6782 individuals from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Anger, anxiety, chronic stress, depressive symptoms, and hostility were measured using validated scales, and physician reviewers adjudicated incident HF events. Cox proportional hazards models were used to adjust for relevant demographic, behavioral, and physiological covariates. Interactions by age, race, sex, and self-reported health were examined in exploratory analyses. During a mean follow-up of 9.3 years, 242 participants developed incident HF. There was no association between psychosocial factors and HF hazard ratios (95{\%} confidence interval) for the highest versus lowest quartile: anger=1.14 (0.81-1.60), anxiety=0.74 (0.51-1.07), chronic stress = 1.25 (0.90-1.72), depressive symptoms= 1.19 (0.76-1.85), and hostility = 0.95 (0.62-1.42). In exploratory analysis, among the participants reporting fair/poor health at baseline, those reporting high versus low levels of anxiety, chronic stress, and depressive symptoms had 2-fold higher risk of incident HF, but there was no association for those with good/very good/excellent self-reported health. Conclusions-Overall, these psychosocial factors were not significantly associated with incident HF. However, for participants reporting poor health at baseline, there was evidence that anxiety, chronic stress, and depressive symptoms were associated with increased risk of HF. Future research with greater statistical power is necessary to replicate these findings and seek explanations.},

abstract = {Anger is associated with cardiovascular stress reactivity; however, little is known about the effect of suppressed anger in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). We examined whether patients with CAD who suppress their anger are at risk of adverse events. At baseline, 644 patients with CAD completed measures of anger, anger-in (reluctance to express anger), and Type D personality (tendency to experience distress and to be inhibited). The combination of high anger and anger-in scores was used to identify the presence of suppressed anger. The end points were major adverse cardiac events (a composite of death, myocardial infarction, and revascularization) and cardiac death/myocardial infarction. After an average follow-up of 6.3 years (range 5 to 10), 126 patients (20{\%}) had experienced a major adverse cardiac event, and 59 (9{\%}) had experienced cardiac death or myocardial infarction. Anger (p = 0.009) and suppressed anger (p = 0.011) were associated with future major adverse cardiac events, but these associations were no longer significant after adjustment for clinical characteristics. However, suppressed anger remained associated with the more rigorous end point of cardiac death or myocardial infarction (odds ratio 2.87, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.15 to 7.15, p = 0.024) after controlling for decreased systolic function, poor exercise tolerance, extent of CAD, and revascularization. Anger alone was not independently associated with this end point. Patients with a Type D personality had a fourfold rate of suppressed anger, and an adjustment for a Type D personality attenuated the observed association between suppressed anger and adverse cardiac events. In conclusion, patients with CAD who suppress their anger were at increased risk of adverse cardiac events, and this was accounted for by individual differences in Type D personality. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Depression increases the risk of cardiac mortality and morbidity in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), but the mechanisms that underlie this association remain unclear. This review considers the evidence for several behavioral and physiological mechanisms that might explain how depression increases the risk for incident coronary disease and for subsequent cardiac morbidity and mortality. The candidate mechanisms include: (1) antidepressant cardiotoxicity; (2) association of depression with cardiac risk factor such as cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and reduced functional capacity; (3) association of depression with greater coronary disease severity; (4) nonadherence to cardiac prevention and treatment regimens; (5) lower heart rate variability (HRV) reflecting altered cardiac autonomic tone; (6) increased platelet aggregation; and (7) inflammatory processes. Despite recent advances in our understanding of these potential mechanisms, further research is needed to determine how depression increases risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The men were {\textless}65 years old at follow-up.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Using two PTSD measures, a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd Edition (DSM-III) measure (D-PTSD) and one developed by Keane (K-PTSD), we found that among Vietnam theater and era veterans combined (era veterans had no Vietnam service), having PTSD was associated with HD mortality for D-PTSD (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.25, p = .045) and approached significance for K-PTSD (HR = 2.16, p = .066). However, having higher PTSD symptoms on either scale was associated with mortality, with a 5-point increase associated with approximately 20{\%} increase in mortality risk (all p {\textless} .05). Controlling for lifetime depression only slightly altered the results. The effects for theater veterans alone were stronger (D-PTSD: HR = 2.58, p = .025; K-PTSD: HR = 2.73, p = .022). Among theater veterans, controlling for lifetime depression or combat exposure made little difference.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: PTSD was prospectively associated with HD mortality among veterans free of HD at baseline. This study suggests that early-age HD may be an outcome after military service among PTSD-positive veterans.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Depression is a risk factor for mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), possibly as a result of altered autonomic nervous system (ANS) modulation of heart rate (HR) and rhythm. The purposes of this study were to determine: a) whether depressed patients are more likely to have an abnormal HR response (i.e., abnormal turbulence) to premature ventricular contractions (VPCs), and b) whether abnormal HR turbulence accounts for the effect of depression on increased mortality after AMI. METHODS Ambulatory electrocardiographic data were obtained from 666 (316 depressed, 350 nondepressed) patients with a recent AMI; 498 had VPCs with measurable HR turbulence. Of these, 260 had normal, 152 had equivocal, and 86 had abnormal HR turbulence. Patients were followed for up to 30 (median = 24) months. RESULTS Depressed patients were more likely to have abnormal HR turbulence (risk factor adjusted odds ratio = 1.8; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.0-3.0; p = .03) and have worse survival (odds ratio = 2.4; 95{\%} CI = 1.2-4.6; p = .02) than nondepressed patients. When HR turbulence was added to the model, the adjusted hazard ratio for depression decreased to 1.9 (95{\%} CI = 0.9-3.8; p = .08), and to 1.6 (95{\%} CI = 0.8-3.4; p = .18) when a measure of HR variability (LnVLF) was added. The hazard was found to differ over time with depression posing little risk for mortality in year 1 but greater risk in years 2 and 3 of the follow up. CONCLUSION ANS dysregulation may partially mediate the increased risk for mortality in depressed patients with frequent VPCs after an AMI.},

Objective To investigate the effect on long-term major adverse cardiac events (MACE) of escitalopram treatment of depression in patients with recent ACS. Design, Setting, and Participants Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted among 300 patients with recent ACS and depression enrolled from May 2007 to March 2013, with follow-up completed in June 2017, at Chonnam National University Hospital, Gwangju, South Korea. Interventions Patients were randomly assigned to receive either escitalopram in flexible dosages of 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg/d (n = 149) or matched placebo (n = 151) for 24 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was MACE, a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Four secondary outcomes were the individual MACE components of all-cause mortality, cardiac death, MI, and PCI. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the escitalopram and placebo groups by time to first MACE. Results Among 300 randomized patients (mean age, 60 years; 119 women [39.3{\%}]), 100{\%} completed a median of 8.1 (interquartile range, 7.5-9.0) years of follow-up. MACE occurred in 61 patients (40.9{\%}) receiving escitalopram and in 81 (53.6{\%}) receiving placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95{\%} CI, 0.49-0.96;P = .03). Comparing individual MACE outcomes between the escitalopram and placebo groups, respectively, incidences for all-cause mortality were 20.8{\%} vs 24.5{\%} (HR, 0.82; 95{\%} CI, 0.51-1.33;P = .43), for cardiac death, 10.7{\%} vs 13.2{\%} (HR, 0.79; 95{\%} CI, 0.41-1.52;P = .48); for MI, 8.7{\%} vs 15.2{\%} (HR, 0.54; 95{\%} CI, 0.27-0.96;P = .04), and for PCI, 12.8{\%} vs 19.9{\%} (HR, 0.58; 95{\%} CI, 0.33-1.04;P = .07). Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with depression following recent acute coronary syndrome, 24-week treatment with escitalopram compared with placebo resulted in a lower risk of major adverse cardiac events after a median of 8.1 years. Further research is needed to assess the generalizability of these findings. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT00419471},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Emerging data suggest that young women with coronary heart disease (CHD) are disproportionally vulnerable to the adverse cardiovascular effects of psychological stress. We hypothesized that younger, but not older, women with stable CHD are more likely than their male peers to develop mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI). METHODS AND RESULTS We studied 686 patients (191 women) with stable coronary heart disease (CHD). Patients underwent (99m)Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest and with both mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) stress testing. We compared quantitative (by automated software) and visual parameters of inducible ischemia between women and men and assessed age as an effect modifier. Women had a more-adverse psychosocial profile than men whereas there were few differences in medical history and CHD risk factors. Both quantitative and visual indicators of ischemia with mental stress were disproportionally larger in younger women. For each 10 years of decreasing age, the total reversibility severity score with mental stress was 9.6 incremental points higher (interaction, P{\textless}0.001) and the incidence of MSIMI was 82.6{\%} higher (interaction, P=0.004) in women than in men. Incidence of MSIMI in women â¤50 years was almost 4-fold higher than in men of similar age and older patients. These results persisted when adjusting for sociodemographic and medical risk factors, psychosocial factors, and medications. There were no significant sex differences in inducible ischemia with conventional stress. CONCLUSIONS Young women with stable CHD are susceptible to MSIMI, which could play a role in the prognosis of this group.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Clinical depression is a risk factor for cardiac mortality in patients with coronary heart disease. High QT interval variability is a risk factor for arrhythmic events, including sudden cardiac death. The purpose of this study was to determine whether depression is associated with increased QT variability in patients recovering from myocardial infarction. METHODS: Twenty patients with major depression recovering from a recent myocardial infarction were matched with 20 nondepressed post-myocardial infarction patients on age and sex, and all underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring. RESULTS: There were no differences between groups on average heart rate, heart rate variability, or other electrocardiographic measures. However, the QT interval showed significantly greater variability in the depressed than in the nondepressed group, especially at midnight and at 6:00 AM. CONCLUSIONS: Depressed post-myocardial infarction patients may be at greater risk for sudden cardiac death as a result of abnormalities in ventricular repolarization. More work is needed to determine the clinical and prognostic significance of QT variability in these patients.},

The mean heart rate for depressed patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) was significantly higher than for nondepressed CAD patients, independent of the patient's age, smoking status, and beta blocker therapy. Heart rate variability was lower in depressed patients but did not achieve significance. With the exception of smoking, which was more common in depressed patients, there were no significant differences between the depressed and nondepressed patients on any other medical or demographic variable assessed.

abstract = {Objective: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is a common phenomenon in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and an emerging prognostic factor. Mental stress ischemia is correlated with ambulatory ischemia. However, whether it is related to angina symptoms during daily life has not been examined. Methods: We assessed angina frequency (past month) in 98 post-myocardial infarction (MI) subjects (age 18-60years) using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. Patients underwent [99mTc]sestamibi SPECT perfusion imaging at rest, after mental stress, and after exercise/pharmacological stress. Summed scores of perfusion abnormalities were obtained by observer-independent software. A summed difference score (SDS), the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. Results: The mean age was 50. years, 50{\%} were female and 60{\%} were non-white. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, CAD severity, depressive, anger, and anxiety symptoms, each 1-point increase in mental stress-SDS was associated with 1.73-unit increase in the angina frequency score (95{\%} CI: 0.09-3.37) and 17{\%} higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.17, 95{\%} CI: 1.00-1.38). Depressive symptoms were associated with 12{\%} higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.12, 95{\%} CI: 1.03-1.21). In contrast, exercise/pharmacological stress-induced SDS was not associated with angina frequency. Conclusion: Among young and middle-aged post-MI patients, myocardial ischemia induced by mental stress in the lab, but not by exercise/pharmacological stress, is associated with higher frequency of retrospectively reported angina during the day. Psychosocial stressors related to mental stress ischemia may be important contributory factor to daily angina.},

abstract = {Objective Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and despite important advances in our understanding of this disorder, the underlying mechanisms remain under investigation. Recently, increased attention has been placed on the role of behavioral factors such as emotional stress on CAD risk. Brain areas involved in memory and the stress response, including medial prefrontal cortex, insula, and parietal cortex, also have outputs to the peripheral cardiovascular system. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of mental stress on brain and cardiac function in patients with CAD. Methods CAD patients (N = 170) underwent cardiac imaging with [Tc-99m] sestamibi single-photon emission tomography at rest and during a public speaking mental stress task. On another day, they underwent imaging of the brain with [O-15] water positron emission tomography (PET) during mental stress (arithmetic and public speaking) and control conditions. Results Patients with mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia showed increased activation with stress in anterior cingulate, inferior frontal gyrus, and parietal cortex (p {\textless}.005). This was seen with both arithmetic stress and public speaking stress. Arithmetic stress was additionally associated with left insula activation, and public speaking with right pre/postcentral gyrus and middle temporal gyrus activation (p {\textless}.005). Conclusions These findings suggest that mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is associated with activation in brain areas involved in the stress response and autonomic regulation of the cardiovascular system. Altered brain reactivity to stress could possibly represent a mechanism through which stress leads to increased risk of CAD-related morbidity and mortality.},

abstract = {Introduction: Psychosocial factors are associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but our understanding of causal mechanisms is limited. Understanding such mechanisms may help formulate prevention strategies. We therefore sought to evaluate potential physiologic effects of psychosocial factors by studying their associations with heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function, in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. Hypothesis: Higher psychosocial stress levels are associated with lower HRV cross-sectionally in a diverse community sample. Methods: We included ARIC cohort participants with information on psychosocial factors in 1990-1992 into our analysis. Psychosocial factors were assessed using validated instruments, including: 1) vital exhaustion, a somatic manifestation of chronic stress and depression, 2) anger proneness, a personality trait, and 3) perceived social support, a potential buffering factor for stress. Short-term time and frequency domain HRV were measured from a two-minute electrocardiographic recording in 1987-1989. Linear regression models adjusted for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors. Results: We included 9,332 participants (mean age 54.4 Â± 5.7 years, 55{\%} women, and 25{\%} black) in the analysis. Only vital exhaustion was consistently associated with HRV, as per the table, which shows the change in ln(HRV) per point increase in score. Compared to the lowest quartile, the highest quartile of vital exhaustion was associated with a 13.3{\%} (95{\%} CI, 3.9{\%} - 21.3{\%}) decrease in low frequency HRV in adjusted models. By comparison, each year of added age was associated with a 3.7{\%} (95{\%} CI, 3.1{\%} to 4.2{\%}) decrease in LF HRV. Conclusion: A high level of vital exhaustion was associated with low HRV, while anger proneness and social support were not. The inverse vital exhaustion-HRV association raises concern regarding the somatic manifestations of stress, a potential target for preventive interventions.},

abstract = {Background Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is associated with adverse prognosis in coronary artery disease patients. Anger is thought to be a trigger of acute coronary syndromes and is associated with increased cardiovascular risk; however, little direct evidence exists for a link between anger and myocardial ischemia. Methods [99mTc]-sestamibi single-photon emission tomography was performed at rest, after mental stress (a social stressor with a speech task) and after exercise/pharmacologic stress. Summed scores of perfusion abnormalities were obtained by observer-independent software. A summed-difference score, the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. The Spielberger's State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory was used to assess different anger dimensions. Results The mean age was 50 years, 50{\%} were female, and 60{\%} were non-white. After adjusting for demographic factors, smoking, coronary artery disease severity, depressive, and anxiety symptoms, each IQR increment in state-anger score was associated with 0.36 U-adjusted increase in ischemia as measured by the summed-difference score (95{\%} CI 0.14-0.59); the corresponding association for trait anger was 0.95 (95{\%} CI 0.21-1.69). Anger expression scales were not associated with ischemia. None of the anger dimensions was related to ischemia during exercise/pharmacologic stress. Conclusion Anger, both as an emotional state and as a personality trait, is significantly associated with propensity to develop myocardial ischemia during mental stress but not during exercise/pharmacologic stress. Patients with this psychologic profile may be at increased risk for silent ischemia induced by emotional stress, and this may translate into worse prognosis. (Am Heart J 2015;169:115-121.e2.).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute mental stress evokes responses in the cardiovascular and the immune systems. In particular, the subset of natural killer (NK) cells is found to be responsive to mental stress. The role of beta-adrenergic mechanisms in these processes in the subject of this investigation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Healthy male volunteers (n = 31) were subjected to two consecutive mental tasks. Subjects were randomly assigned to a beta-blocker (propranolol 40 mg) or a placebo group. The capsules were ingested 1 hour before the tasks. The tasks evoked sympathetic responses, as indicated by an increase in heart rate and a decrease in the preejection period. These effects were abolished under beta-blockade, indicating that effective beta-blockade was achieved. In the immune system, significant increases were found for the number of NK cells and NK cell activity in the placebo group; these increases were absent in the propranolol group. In addition, an increase in all lymphocyte subsets was observed in subjects who had ingested propranolol. This increase, however, was also observed in subjects who had received propranolol but had not performed the tasks, indicating that these non-subset-specific increases in lymphocytes were a side effect of the beta-blocker. CONCLUSIONS: Mental stress induces activation of the sympathetic nervous system, with concomitant increases in the number of NK cells in the circulation. These changes were inhibited by propranolol, indicating that stress-induced increases in the number and activity of NK cells in the circulation are controlled by a beta-adrenergic mechanism.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Coronary microvascular dysfunction may contribute to myocardial ischemia during mental stress (MS). However, the role of coronary epicardial and microvascular function in regulating coronary blood flow (CBF) responses during MS remains understudied. We hypothesized that coronary vasomotion during MS is dependent on the coronary microvascular endothelial function and will be reflected in the peripheral microvascular circulation. METHODS AND RESULTS In 38 patients aged 59Â±8 years undergoing coronary angiography, endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent coronary epicardial and microvascular responses were measured using intracoronary acetylcholine and nitroprusside, respectively, and after MS induced by mental arithmetic testing. Peripheral microvascular tone during MS was measured using peripheral arterial tonometry (Itamar Inc, Caesarea, Israel) as the ratio of digital pulse wave amplitude compared to rest (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio). MS increased the rate-pressure product by 22{\%} (Â±23{\%}) and constricted epicardial coronary arteries by -5.9{\%} (-10.5{\%}, -2.6{\%}) (median [interquartile range]), P=0.001, without changing CBF. Acetylcholine increased CBF by 38.5{\%} (8.1{\%}, 91.3{\%}), P=0.001, without epicardial coronary diameter change (0.1{\%} [-10.9{\%}, 8.2{\%}], P=not significant). The MS-induced CBF response correlated with endothelium-dependent CBF changes with acetylcholine (r=0.38, P=0.03) but not with the response to nitroprusside. The peripheral arterial tonometry ratio also correlated with the demand-adjusted change in CBF during MS (r=-0.60, P=0.004), indicating similarity between the microcirculatory responses to MS in the coronary and peripheral microcirculation. CONCLUSIONS The coronary microvascular response to MS is determined by endothelium-dependent, but not endothelium-independent, coronary microvascular function. Moreover, the coronary microvascular responses to MS are reflected in the peripheral microvascular circulation.},

abstract = {Background: Somatic depressive symptoms and certain biomarkers are each associated with worse acute myocardial infarction (AMI) prognosis, but the relationship between depressive symptom domains and inflammatory, neurohormonal, and coagulation markers is unknown. Methods: We examined the relationship between depressive symptoms and 1-month biomarker levels (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP], N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP], white blood cell [WBC], platelet counts) in 1265 AMI patients. Depressive symptoms (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire) were assessed during index hospitalization and categorized as somatic or cognitive. Using median regression models, the upper quartile of somatic and cognitive depression scores and each biomarker were compared with the lower three quartiles, adjusting for site, demographics, and clinical characteristics. Results: Although hs-CRP values were higher in patients with somatic symptoms, this association was attenuated after adjustment (B per SD increase =.02, 95{\%} confidence interval:.00;.05, p =.07). WBC count was independently associated with somatic depressive symptoms (B per SD increase =.28, 95{\%} confidence interval:.12;.44, p {\textless}.001). Cognitive depressive symptoms were not associated with hs-CRP or WBC count. Neither dimension was associated with NT-proBNP or platelet levels. For each biomarker, the depression dimensions explained {\textless}1{\%} of their variation. Conclusions: Neither somatic nor cognitive depressive symptoms were meaningfully associated with hs-CRP, NT-proBNP, WBC, or platelet counts 1 month after AMI, suggesting that the association between depression and long-term outcomes may be unrelated to these biomarkers. Future research should explore other biomarkers to better illuminate pathways by which depression adversely impacts AMI prognosis. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

DESIGN AND METHODS One hundred eighteen healthy young women provided data on ACEs and underwent psychosocial stress testing. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA, quantified by high-frequency HR variability) were assessed as measures of sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiovascular activity, respectively. A mediation model was calculated to test the indirect effects of ACEs on HR via SBP and RSA. RESULTS The effect of ACEs on HR reactivity was mediated by SBP reactivity but not by RSA reactivity. ACEs were associated with reduced SBP at rest. CONCLUSIONS ACEs were associated with down-regulation in a measure of sympathetic but no alteration in a measure of parasympathetic cardiovascular stress reactivity in adulthood. Future research will need to clarify whether this indicates risk or resilience.},

abstract = {Background Many anecdotes and several uncontrolled case series have suggested that emotionally stressful events, and more specifically, anger, immediately precede and appear to trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction. However, controlled studies to determine the relative risk of myocardial infarction after episodes of anger have not been reported. Methods and Results We interviewed 1623 patients (501 women) an average of 4 days after myocardial infarction. The interview identified the time, place, and quality of myocardial infarction pain and other symptoms, the estimated usual frequency of anger during the previous year, and the intensity and timing of anger and other potentially triggering factors during the 26 hours before the onset of myocardial infarction. Anger was assessed by the onset anger scale, a single-item, seven-level, self-report scale, and the state anger subscale of the State-Trait Personality Inventory. Occurrence of anger in the 2 hours preceding the onset of myocardial infarction was compared with its expected frequency using two types of self-matched control data based on the case-crossover study design. The onset anger scale identified 39 patients with episodes of anger in the 2 hours before the onset of myocardial infarction. The relative risk of myocardial infarction in the 2 hours after an episode of anger was 2.3 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.7 to 3.2). The state anger subscale corroborated these findings with a relative risk of 1.9 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.7). Regular users of aspirin had a significantly lower relative risk (1.4; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.8 to 2.6) than nonusers (2.9; 95{\%} confidence interval, 2.0 to 4.1) (P{\textless}.05). Conclusions Episodes of anger are capable of triggering the onset of acute myocardial infarction, but aspirin may reduce this risk. A better understanding of the manner in which external events trigger the onset of acute cardiovascular events may lead to innovative preventive strategies aimed at severing the link between these external stressors and their pathological consequences.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Young women with coronary heart disease have high rates of depression and a higher risk of adverse events than men of similar age. Whether depression has a higher prognostic value in this group than in men and older women is not known. Our objective was to assess whether depression in young women is associated with higher risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and adverse outcomes compared with similarly aged men and older women. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined 3237 patients undergoing coronary angiography for evaluation of CAD and followed them for 2.9 years (median). Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9, and CAD burden was dichotomized based on its presence or absence. After multivariable adjustment for CAD risk factors, depressive symptoms predicted CAD presence in women aged â¤ 55 years (odds ratio=1.07 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.02 to 1.13 per 1 point increase in PHQ-9 score), but not in men aged â¤ 55 years or women aged {\textgreater}55 years. Depressive symptoms also predicted increased risk of death in women aged â¤ 55 years (adjusted hazard ratio=1.07, 95{\%} CI 1.02 to 1.14, per 1 point increase in PHQ-9 score), but not in men aged â¤ 55 years and women aged {\textgreater}55 years, with P=0.02 for the depression-sex interaction and P=0.02 for depression-sex-age interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with suspected or established CAD, depressive symptoms are associated with increased risk of death, particularly in young women. This group may be especially vulnerable to the adverse cardiovascular effects of depression.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased research attention is being paid to the negative impact of anger on coronary heart disease (CHD). METHODS AND RESULTS: This study examined prospectively the association between trait anger and the risk of combined CHD (acute myocardial infarction [MI]/fatal CHD, silent MI, or cardiac revascularization procedures) and of "hard" events (acute MI/fatal CHD). Participants were 12 986 black and white men and womenenrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities study. In the entire cohort, individuals with high trait anger, compared with their low anger counterparts, were at increased risk of CHD in both event categories. The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) (95{\%} CI) was 1.54 (95{\%} CI 1.10 to 2.16) for combined CHD and 1.75 (95{\%} CI 1.17 to 2.64) for "hard" events. Heterogeneity of effect was observed by hypertensive status. Among normotensive individuals, the risk of combined CHD and of "hard" events increased monotonically with increasing levels of trait anger. The multivariate-adjusted HR of CHD for high versus low anger was 2.20 (95{\%} CI 1.36 to 3.55) and for moderate versus low anger was 1.32 (95{\%} CI 0.94 to 1.84). For "hard" events, the multivariate-adjusted HRs were 2.69 (95{\%} CI 1.48 to 4.90) and 1.35 (95{\%} CI 0.87 to 2.10), respectively. No statistically significant association between trait anger and incident CHD risk was observed among hypertensive individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Proneness to anger places normotensive middle-aged men and women at significant risk for CHD morbidity and death independent of the established biological risk factors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND - : Although prospective studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses have documented an association between depression and increased morbidity and mortality in a variety of cardiac populations, depression has not yet achieved formal recognition as a risk factor for poor prognosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome by the American Heart Association and other health organizations. The purpose of this scientific statement is to review available evidence and recommend whether depression should be elevated to the status of a risk factor for patients with acute coronary syndrome. METHODS AND RESULTS - : Writing group members were approved by the American Heart Association's Scientific Statement and Manuscript Oversight Committees. A systematic literature review on depression and adverse medical outcomes after acute coronary syndrome was conducted that included all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality, and composite outcomes for mortality and nonfatal events. The review assessed the strength, consistency, independence, and generalizability of the published studies. A total of 53 individual studies (32 reported on associations with all-cause mortality, 12 on cardiac mortality, and 22 on composite outcomes) and 4 meta-analyses met inclusion criteria. There was heterogeneity across studies in terms of the demographic composition of study samples, definition and measurement of depression, length of follow-up, and covariates included in the multivariable models. Despite limitations in some individual studies, our review identified generally consistent associations between depression and adverse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS - : Despite the heterogeneity of published studies included in this review, the preponderance of evidence supports the recommendation that the American Heart Association should elevate depression to the status of a risk factor for adverse medical outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.},

abstract = {Introduction: Psychosocial factors are associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but our understanding of causal mechanisms is limited. Understanding such mechanisms may help formulate prevention strategies. We therefore sought to evaluate potential physiologic effects of psychosocial factors by studying their associations with heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function, in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. Hypothesis: Higher psychosocial stress levels are associated with lower HRV cross-sectionally in a diverse community sample. Methods: We included ARIC cohort participants with information on psychosocial factors in 1990-1992 into our analysis. Psychosocial factors were assessed using validated instruments, including: 1) vital exhaustion, a somatic manifestation of chronic stress and depression, 2) anger proneness, a personality trait, and 3) perceived social support, a potential buffering factor for stress. Short-term time and frequency domain HRV were measured from a two-minute electrocardiographic recording in 1987-1989. Linear regression models adjusted for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors. Results: We included 9,332 participants (mean age 54.4 Â± 5.7 years, 55{\%} women, and 25{\%} black) in the analysis. Only vital exhaustion was consistently associated with HRV, as per the table, which shows the change in ln(HRV) per point increase in score. Compared to the lowest quartile, the highest quartile of vital exhaustion was associated with a 13.3{\%} (95{\%} CI, 3.9{\%} - 21.3{\%}) decrease in low frequency HRV in adjusted models. By comparison, each year of added age was associated with a 3.7{\%} (95{\%} CI, 3.1{\%} to 4.2{\%}) decrease in LF HRV. Conclusion: A high level of vital exhaustion was associated with low HRV, while anger proneness and social support were not. The inverse vital exhaustion-HRV association raises concern regarding the somatic manifestations of stress, a potential target for preventive interventions.},

abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether psychological factors are associated with heart rate variability (HRV), blood pressure variability (BPV), and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) among healthy middle-aged men and women. Methods: A population-based sample of 71 men and 79 women (35-64 years of age) was studied. Five-minute supine recordings of ECG and beat-to-beat photoplethysmographic finger systolic arterial pressure and diastolic arterial pressure were obtained during paced breathing. Power spectra were computed using a fast Fourier transform for low-frequency (0.04-0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (0.15-0.40 Hz) powers. BRS was calculated by cross-spectral analysis of R-R interval and systolic arterial pressure variabilities. Psychological factors were evaluated by three self-report questionnaires: the Brief Symptom Inventory, the shortened version of the Spielberger State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory, and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. Results: Psychological factors were not related to HRV. Anxiety was associated with decreased BRS (p = 0.001) and higher low-frequency (p = 0.002) power of systolic arterial pressure variability. These associations were independent of age, gender, other psychological factors, heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Hostility was an independent correlate of increased low-frequency power of diastolic arterial pressure (p = 0.001) and increased high-frequency power of systolic arterial pressure (p = 0.033) variability. Conclusions: Anxiety and hostility are related to reduced BRS and increased low-frequency power of BPV. Reduced BRS reflects decreased parasympathetic outflow to the heart and may increase BPV through an increased sympathetic predominance.},

abstract = {In the present paper we present the outlines of a model that integrates autonomic, attentional, and affective systems into a functional and structural network that may help to guide us in our understanding of emotion regulation and dysregulation. We will emphasize the relationship between attentional regulation and affective processes and propose a group of underlying physiological systems that serve to integrate these functions in the service of self-regulation and adaptability of the organism. We will attempt to place this network in the context of dynamical systems models which involve feedback and feedforward circuits with special attention to negative feedback mechanisms, inhibitory processes, and their role in response selection. From a systems perspective, inhibitory processes can be viewed as negative feedback circuits that allow for the interruption of ongoing behavior and the re-deployment of resources to other tasks. When these negative feedback mechanisms are compromised, positive feedback loops may develop as a result (of dis-inhibition). From this perspective, the relative sympathetic activation seen in anxiety disorders may represent dis-inhibition due to faulty inhibitory mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Background Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is associated with adverse prognosis in coronary artery disease patients. Anger is thought to be a trigger of acute coronary syndromes and is associated with increased cardiovascular risk; however, little direct evidence exists for a link between anger and myocardial ischemia. Methods [99mTc]-sestamibi single-photon emission tomography was performed at rest, after mental stress (a social stressor with a speech task) and after exercise/pharmacologic stress. Summed scores of perfusion abnormalities were obtained by observer-independent software. A summed-difference score, the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. The Spielberger's State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory was used to assess different anger dimensions. Results The mean age was 50 years, 50{\%} were female, and 60{\%} were non-white. After adjusting for demographic factors, smoking, coronary artery disease severity, depressive, and anxiety symptoms, each IQR increment in state-anger score was associated with 0.36 U-adjusted increase in ischemia as measured by the summed-difference score (95{\%} CI 0.14-0.59); the corresponding association for trait anger was 0.95 (95{\%} CI 0.21-1.69). Anger expression scales were not associated with ischemia. None of the anger dimensions was related to ischemia during exercise/pharmacologic stress. Conclusion Anger, both as an emotional state and as a personality trait, is significantly associated with propensity to develop myocardial ischemia during mental stress but not during exercise/pharmacologic stress. Patients with this psychologic profile may be at increased risk for silent ischemia induced by emotional stress, and this may translate into worse prognosis. (Am Heart J 2015;169:115-121.e2.).},

abstract = {Mental stress reduces performances, on the work place and in daily life, and is one of the first causes of cognitive dysfunctions, cardiovascular disorders and depression. This study systematically reviewed existing literature investigating, in healthy subjects, the associations between acute mental stress and short term Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measures in time, frequency and non-linear domain. The goal of this study was to provide reliable information about the trends and the pivot values of HRV measures during mental stress. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence was conducted, performing an exhaustive research of electronic repositories and linear researching references of papers responding to the inclusion criteria. After removing duplicates and not pertinent papers, journal papers describing well-designed studies that analyzed rigorously HRV were included if analyzed the same population of healthy subjects at rest and during mental stress. 12 papers were shortlisted, enrolling overall 758 volunteers and investigating 22 different HRV measures, 9 of which reported by at least 2 studies and therefore meta-analyzed in this review. Four measures in time and non-linear domains, associated with a normal degree of HRV variations resulted significantly depressed during stress. The power of HRV fluctuations at high frequencies was significantly depressed during stress, while the ratio between low and high frequency resulted significantly increased, suggesting a sympathetic activation and a parasympathetic withdrawal during acute mental stress. Finally, among the 15 non-linear measures extracted, only 2 were reported by at least 2 studies, therefore pooled, and only one resulted significantly depressed, suggesting a reduced chaotic behaviour during mental stress. HRV resulted significantly depressed during mental stress, showing a reduced variability and less chaotic behaviour. The pooled frequency domain measures demonstrated a significant autonomic balance shift during acute mental stress towards the sympathetic activation and the parasympathetic withdrawal. Pivot values for the pooled mean differences of HRV measures are provided. Further studies investigating HRV non-linear measures during mental stress are still required. However, the method proposed to transform and then meta-analyze the HRV measures can be applied to other fields where HRV proved to be clinically significant.},

abstract = {The objective of the study was to determine which component of an anger-prone personality more strongly predicts coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. Proneness to anger, as assessed by the Spielberger Trait Anger Scale, is composed of two distinct subcomponents - anger-temperament and anger-reaction. Participants were 12,990 middle-aged Black men and women and White men and women from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study who were followed for the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction (MI)/fatal CHD, silent MI, or cardiac revascularization procedures (average = 53 months; maximum = 72 months) through December 31, 1995. Among normotensive persons, a strong, angry temperament (tendency toward quick, minimally provoked, or unprovoked anger) was associated with combined CHD (acute MI/fatal CHD, silent MI, or cardiac revascularization procedures) (multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio = 2.10, 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.34, 3.29) and with "hard" events (acute MI/fatal CHD) (multivariate adjusted hazard ratio = 2.28, 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.29, 4.02). CHD event-free survival among normotensives who had a strong, angry temperament was not significantly different from that of hypertensives at either level of anger. These data suggest that a strong, angry temperament rather than anger in reaction to criticism, frustration, or unfair treatment places normotensive, middle-aged persons at increased risk for cardiac events and may confer a CHD risk similar to that of hypertension.},

abstract = {Importance Depressive symptoms are associated with lower heart rate variability (HRV), an index of autonomic dysregulation, but the direction of the association remains unclear. Objective To investigate the temporal association between depression and HRV. Design, Settings, and Participants A longitudinal, cross-lagged twin difference study, with baseline assessments from March 2002 to March 2006 (visit 1) and a 7-year follow-up (visit 2) at an academic research center with participants recruited from a national twin registry. Twins (n = 166) from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, who served in the US military during the Vietnam War, and were discordant for depression at baseline were recruited. Main Outcomes and Measures At both visits, depressive symptoms were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and HRV was measured through 24-hour electrocardiogram monitoring. To assess the direction of the association, within-pair differences in multivariable mixed-effects regression models were examined, and standardized $\beta$ coefficients for both pathways were calculated. The associations were evaluated separately in monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Results In the final analytic sample (N = 146), all participants were men, 138 (95{\%}) were white, and the mean (SD) age was 54 (3) years at baseline. Results showed consistent associations between visit 1 HRV and visit 2 BDI score across all HRV domains and models ($\beta$ coefficients ranging from â0.14 to â0.29), which were not explained by antidepressants or other participant characteristics. The magnitude of the association was similar in the opposite pathway linking visit 1 BDI score to visit 2 HRV, with $\beta$ coefficients ranging from 0.05 to â0.30, but it was largely explained by antidepressant use. In stratified analysis by zygosity, significant associations were observed in monozygotic and dizygotic twins for the path linking visit 1 HRV to visit 2 BDI score, although the associations were slightly stronger in dizygotic twins. Conclusions and Relevance The association between depression and autonomic dysregulation, indexed by HRV, is bidirectional, with stronger evidence suggesting that autonomic function affects depression risk rather than vice versa. The opposite causal pathway from depression to lower HRV is mostly driven by antidepressant use. These findings highlight an important role of autonomic nervous system in the risk of depression and contribute new understanding of the mechanisms underlying the comorbidity of depression and cardiovascular disease.},

abstract = {Background: Research on the etiology of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has rapidly matured, moving from candidate gene studies to interrogation of the entire human genome in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we present the results of a GWAS performed on samples from combat-exposed U.S. Marines and Sailors from the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS) scheduled for deployment to Iraq and/or Afghanistan. The MRS is a large, prospective study with longitudinal follow-up designed to identify risk and resiliency factors for combat-induced stress-related symptoms. Previously implicated PTSD risk loci from the literature and polygenic risk scores across psychiatric disorders were also evaluated in the MRS cohort. Methods: Participants (. N=. 3494) were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale and diagnosed using the DSM-IV diagnostic criterion. Subjects with partial and/or full PTSD diagnosis were called cases, all other subjects were designated controls, and study-wide maximum CAPS scores were used for longitudinal assessments. Genomic DNA was genotyped on the Illumina HumanOmniExpressExome array. Individual genetic ancestry was determined by supervised cluster analysis for subjects of European, African, Hispanic/Native American, and other descent. To test for association of SNPs with PTSD, logistic regressions were performed within each ancestry group and results were combined in meta-analyses. Measures of childhood and adult trauma were included to test for gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions. Polygenic risk scores from the Psychiatric Genomic Consortium were used for major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BPD), and schizophrenia (SCZ). Results: The array produced {\textgreater}800K directly genotyped and {\textgreater}21M imputed markers in 3494 unrelated, trauma-exposed males, of which 940 were diagnosed with partial or full PTSD. The GWAS meta-analysis identified the phosphoribosyl transferase domain containing 1 gene (PRTFDC1) as a genome-wide significant PTSD locus (rs6482463; OR=1.47, SE=0.06, p=2.04Ã10-9), with a similar effect across ancestry groups. Association of PRTFDC1 with PTSD in an independent military cohort showed some evidence for replication. Loci with suggestive evidence of association (n=25 genes, p{\textless}5Ã10-6) further implicated genes related to immune response and the ubiquitin system, but these findings remain to be replicated in larger GWASs. A replication analysis of 25 putative PTSD genes from the literature found nominally significant SNPs for the majority of these genes, but associations did not remain significant after correction for multiple comparison. A cross-disorder analysis of polygenic risk scores from GWASs of BPD, MDD, and SCZ found that PTSD diagnosis was associated with risk sores of BPD, but not with MDD or SCZ. Conclusions: This first multi-ethnic/racial GWAS of PTSD highlights the potential to increase power through meta-analyses across ancestry groups. We found evidence for PRTFDC1 as a potential novel PTSD gene, a finding that awaits further replication. Our findings indicate that the genetic architecture of PTSD may be determined by many SNPs with small effects, and overlap with other neuropsychiatric disorders, consistent with current findings from large GWAS of other psychiatric disorders.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED In patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), mental stress may provoke ischemic electrocardiograph changes and abnormalities in regional and global left ventricular function. However, little is known about the underlying myocardial blood flow response (MBF) in these patients. METHODS We investigated the hemodynamic, neurohumoral, and myocardial blood flow responses to mental stress in 17 patients with CAD and 17 healthy volunteers of similar age. Mental stress was induced by asking individuals to solve mathematic subtractions in a progressively challenging sequence; MBF was quantified at rest and during mental stress using 13N ammonia PET. RESULTS Mental stress induced significant (P {\textless} 0.01) and comparable increases in rate-pressure product, measured in beats per minute x mm Hg, in both patients (from 7826 +/- 2006 to 10586 +/- 2800) and healthy volunteers (from 8227 +/- 1272 to 10618 +/- 2468). Comparable increases also occurred in serum epinephrine (58{\%} in patients versus 52{\%} in healthy volunteers) and norepinephrine (22{\%} in patients versus 27{\%} in healthy volunteers). Although MBF increased in patients (from 0.67 +/- 0.15 to 0.77 +/- 0.18 mL/min/g, P {\textless} 0.05) and healthy volunteers (from 0.73 +/- 0.13 to 0.95 +/- 0.22 mL/min/g, P {\textless} 0.001), the magnitude of flow increase was smaller in patients (14{\%} +/- 17{\%}) than in healthy volunteers (29{\%} +/- 14{\%}) (P = 0.01). The increase in MBF during mental stress correlated significantly with changes in cardiac work in healthy volunteers (r = 0.77; P {\textless} 0.001) but not in patients. CONCLUSION Despite similar increases in cardiac work and comparable sympathetic stimulation in CAD patients and healthy volunteers, CAD patients exhibit an attenuated blood flow response to mental stress that may contribute to mental stress-induced ischemic episodes in daily life.},

These observational findings prompted multiple scientific panels to advise universal depression screening in survivors of ACS prior to evidence from randomized screening trials. Objective: To determine whether systematically screening for depression in survivors of ACS improves quality of life and depression compared with usual care. Design, Setting, and Participants: A 3-group multisite randomized trial enrolled 1500 patients with ACS from 4 health care systems between November 1, 2013, and March 31, 2017, with follow-up ending July 31, 2018. Patients were eligible if they had been hospitalized for ACS in the previous 2 to 12 months and had no prior history of depression. All analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Interventions: Patients with ACS were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive (1) systematic depression screening using the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire, with notification of primary care clinicians and provision of centralized, patient-preference, stepped depression care for those with positive screening results (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire score â¥10; screen, notify, and treat, n = 499); (2) systematic depression screening, with notification of primary care clinicians for those with positive screening results (screen and notify, n = 501); and (3) usual care (no screening, n = 500). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was change in quality-adjusted life-years. The secondary outcome was depression-free days. Adverse effects and mortality were assessed by patient interview and hospital records. Results: A total of 1500 patients (424 women and 1076 men; mean [SD] age, 65.9 [11.5] years) were randomized in the 18-month trial. Only 71 of 1000 eligible survivors of ACS (7.1{\%}) had elevated 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire scores indicating depressive symptoms at screening. There were no differences in mean (SD) change in quality-adjusted life-years (screen, notify and treat, -0.06 [0.20]; screen and notify, -0.06 [0.20]; no screen, -0.06 [0.18]; P =.98) or cumulative mean (SD) depression-free days (screen, notify and treat, 343.1 [179.0] days; screen and notify, 351.3 [175.0] days; no screen, 339.0 [176.6] days; P =.63). Harms including death, bleeding, or sleep difficulties did not differ among groups. Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with ACS without a history of depression, systematic depression screening with or without providing depression treatment did not alter quality-adjusted life-years, depression-free days, or harms.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is frequent in patients with coronary artery disease and is associated with worse prognosis. Young women with a previous myocardial infarction (MI), a group with unexplained higher mortality than men of comparable age, have shown elevated rates of MSIMI, but the mechanisms are unknown. METHODS We studied 306 patients (150 women and 156 men) â¤61 years of age who were hospitalized for MI in the previous 8 months and 112 community controls (58 women and 54 men) frequency matched for sex and age to the patients with MI. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation and microvascular reactivity (reactive hyperemia index) were measured at rest and 30 minutes after mental stress. The digital vasomotor response to mental stress was assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry. Patients received 99mTc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest, with mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) stress. RESULTS The mean age of the sample was 50 years (range, 22-61). In the MI group but not among controls, women had a more adverse socioeconomic and psychosocial profile than men. There were no sex differences in cardiovascular risk factors, and among patients with MI, clinical severity tended to be lower in women. Women in both groups showed a higher peripheral arterial tonometry ratio during mental stress but a lower reactive hyperemia index after mental stress, indicating enhanced microvascular dysfunction after stress. There were no sex differences in flow-mediated dilation changes with mental stress. The rate of MSIMI was twice as high in women as in men (22{\%} versus 11{\%}, P=0.009), and ischemia with conventional stress was similarly elevated (31{\%} versus 16{\%}, P=0.002). Psychosocial and clinical risk factors did not explain sex differences in inducible ischemia. Although vascular responses to mental stress (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio and reactive hyperemia index) also did not explain sex differences in MSIMI, they were predictive of MSIMI in women only. CONCLUSIONS Young women after MI have a 2-fold likelihood of developing MSIMI compared with men and a similar increase in conventional stress ischemia. Microvascular dysfunction and peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress are implicated in MSIMI among women but not among men, perhaps reflecting women's proclivity toward ischemia because of microcirculatory abnormalities.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To clarify the relationship between depression and heart rate variability (HRV) in a sample of twins. Reduced HRV, a measure of autonomic dysfunction, has been linked to depression but many studies have inadequately controlled for familial and environmental factors. Furthermore, little is known about whether depression and HRV share common genetic pathways.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We performed power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms in 288 middle-aged male twins. Log-normalized ultra low, very low, low, high frequency, and total power were calculated. A lifetime history of major depressive disorder (MDD) was determined, using the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders, and current depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory. Mixed-effect regression models were used to account for intrapair variability and estimate within-pair effects at the same time controlling for potential confounders.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Both current depressive symptoms and a history of MDD were significantly associated with lower HRV. There was a graded effect, and power in each frequency band was 29{\%} to 36{\%} lower in the lowest band compared with the highest BDI category. All HRV measures except high frequency remained significantly associated with current depressive symptoms in multivariable analysis, but not with lifetime history of MDD. When analyses were stratified by zygosity, a significant within-pair association between BDI score and HRV was found in the dizygotic but not in the monozygotic twins, suggesting a genetic influence on the association.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: A shared, genetically influenced biological pathway underlies the association between depression and lower HRV. These two phenotypes may be the expression of a generalized neurobiological perturbation.},

The purpose of this scientific statement is to review available evidence and recommend whether depression should be elevated to the status of a risk factor for patients with acute coronary syndrome. METHODS AND RESULTS - : Writing group members were approved by the American Heart Association's Scientific Statement and Manuscript Oversight Committees. A systematic literature review on depression and adverse medical outcomes after acute coronary syndrome was conducted that included all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality, and composite outcomes for mortality and nonfatal events. The review assessed the strength, consistency, independence, and generalizability of the published studies. A total of 53 individual studies (32 reported on associations with all-cause mortality, 12 on cardiac mortality, and 22 on composite outcomes) and 4 meta-analyses met inclusion criteria. There was heterogeneity across studies in terms of the demographic composition of study samples, definition and measurement of depression, length of follow-up, and covariates included in the multivariable models. Despite limitations in some individual studies, our review identified generally consistent associations between depression and adverse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS - : Despite the heterogeneity of published studies included in this review, the preponderance of evidence supports the recommendation that the American Heart Association should elevate depression to the status of a risk factor for adverse medical outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.},

The physiological mechanisms accounting for this association are unclear. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal dysregulation, diminished heart rate variability, altered blood platelet function and noncompliance with medial treatments have been proposed as mechanisms underlying depression and cardiovascular disease. Recent evidence also suggests that reduced baroreflex sensitivity, impaired immune function, chronic fatigue and the co-morbidity of depression and anxiety may be involved in the relationship between depression and cardiovascular dysregulation. An experimental strategy using animal models for investigating underlying physiological abnormalities in depression is presented. A key to understanding the bidirectional association between depression and heart disease is to determine whether there are common changes in brain systems that are associated with these conditions. Such approaches may hold promise for advancing our understanding of the interaction between this mood disorder and CAD. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Mental stress-induced ischemia approximately doubles the risk of cardiac events in patients with coronary artery disease, yet the mechanisms underlying changes in coronary blood flow in response to mental stress are poorly characterized. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) regulates basal coronary blood flow in healthy humans and mediates mental stress-induced vasodilation in the forearm. However, its possible role in mental stress-induced increases in coronary blood flow is unknown. We studied 11 patients (6 men and 5 women, mean age: 58 Â± 14 yr) undergoing elective diagnostic cardiac catheterization and assessed the vasodilator response to mental stress elicited by the Stroop color-word test. Intracoronary substance P (20 pmol/min) and isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg) were used to assess endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation, respectively. Coronary blood flow was estimated using intracoronary Doppler recordings and quantitative coronary angiography to measure coronary artery diameter. Mental stress increased coronary flow by 34 Â± 7.0{\%} over the preceding baseline during saline infusion (P {\textless} 0.01), and this was reduced to 26 Â± 7.0{\%} in the presence of the selective nNOS inhibitor S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline (0.625 Âµmol/min, P {\textless} 0.001). Mental stress increased coronary artery diameter by 6.9 Â± 3.7{\%} (P = 0.02) and 0.5 Â± 2.8{\%} (P = 0.51) in the presence of S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline. The response to substance P did not predict the response to mental stress (r(2) = -0.22, P = 0.83). nNOS mediates the human coronary vasodilator response to mental stress, predominantly through actions at the level of coronary resistance vessels.NEW {\&} NOTEWORTHY Acute mental stress induces vasodilation of the coronary microvasculature. Here, we show that this response involves neuronal nitric oxide synthase in the human coronary circulation.Listen to this article's corresponding podcast at http://ajpheart.podbean.com/e/nnos-and-coronary-flow-during-mental-stress/.},

abstract = {Publication date: Available online 23 December 2018 Source: Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry Author(s): Andrea Locci, Graziano Pinna Abstract Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by drastic alterations in mood, emotions, social abilities and cognition. Notably, one aspect of PTSD, particularly in veterans, is its comorbidity with suicide. Elevated aggressiveness predicts high-risk to suicide in humans and despite the difficulty in reproducing a complex human suicidal behavior in rodents, aggressive behavior is a well reproducible behavioral trait of suicide. PTSD animal models are based on a peculiar phenotype, including exaggerated fear memory, anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors associated with neurochemical dysregulations in emotional brain circuitry. The endocannabinoid and the neurosteroid systems regulate emotions and stress responses, and recent evidence shows these two systems are interrelated and critically compromised in neuropsychiatric disorders. For instance, levels of the neurosteroid, allopregnanolone, as well as those of the endocannabinoids, anandamide and its congener, palmitoylethanolamide are decreased in PTSD. Similarly, the endocannabinoid system and neurosteroid biosynthesis are altered in suicidal individuals. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the only FDA-approved treatments for PTSD and depression, fail to help half of the treatment-seeking patients. This highlights the need for developing biomarker-based efficient therapies. One promising hypothesis points to stimulation of allopregnanolone biosynthesis as a valid end-point to predict treatment response in PTSD patients. This review highlights running findings on the role of the endocannabinoid and neurosteroid systems in PTSD and suicidal behavior both in a preclinical and clinical perspective. A specific focus is given to predictive PTSD/suicide animal models. Ultimately, we discuss the idea that disruption of neurosteroid and endocannabinoid biosynthesis may offer novel promising biomarker candidates to develop new treatments for PTSD and, perhaps, suicidal behavior.},

abstract = {There is growing evidence that psychosocial stress can influence the natural history of coronary heart disease.1 Epidemiological studies indicate that psychosocial factors both contribute to the development of coronary artery disease (CAD), and increase risk of cardiac dysfunction and the likelihood of cardiac events in susceptible patients with established disease.2,3 An important method of assessing effects on cardiac function is by measuring transient ischaemic responses to standardized mental stress tests. Mental stress-induced myocardial ischaemia (MSIMI) is analogous to exercise stress ischaemia, except that the stimulus is psychological rather than physical. MSIMI has been studied with a number of different imaging techniques and with a range of stressful stimuli. But several investigations have involved small numbers of patients, and the medication status of patients has been variable. This has resulted in diverse findings concerning the prevalence of MSIMI, the conditions in which it is elicited, the type of patients who are most susceptible, the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon, and its clinical significance. In an effort to clarify these issues, we have conducted a systematic review of studies in which myocardial ischaemic responses have been measured in response to standardized mental stressors in the laboratory and clinic. Relevant articles were identified from searches of PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed)between 1980 and 2002. Only articles in English language peer-reviewed publications were examined. We included studies that examined the link between standardized mental stress tests and myocardial ischaemic responses. Studies involving patients with CAD and healthy volunteers or patients without CAD were included. To ensure comprehensive data location, further searches were made for authors published in this field and review articles were used as sources. The bibliographies of all papers retrieved were hand searched to ensure as many articles as possible were obtained. A number of studies in this field have resulted in multiple publications, {\ldots}},

Although the therapeutic approach of HRVB is promising in various stress-related disorders, it has only been offered on a regular basis in a few mental health treatment settings. AIM To analyse the efficacy of HRV biofeedback as an additional psychophysiological treatment for depression and PTSD. METHOD Systematic review with search terms HRV, biofeedback, PTSD, depression, panic disorder and anxiety disorder. RESULTS Our search of the literature yielded 789 studies. After critical appraisal using the GRADE method, we selected 6 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 4 relevant studies. The RCTs with control groups 'treatment as usual' and muscle relaxation training revealed significant clinical efficacy and better results than codntrol conditions after 4 to 8 weeks training. CONCLUSION Although this systematic review shows the popularity of HRV in literature, it does not indicate that HRVB really has been reviewed systematically. Significant outcomes of this limited number of randomised studies indicate there may be a clinical improvement when HRVB training is integrated into treatment of PTSD and depression, particularly when this integration procedure is combined with psychotherapy. More research needs to be done with larger groups and further efforts are needed to integrate HRVB into treatment of stress-related disorders in psychiatry. Future research also needs to focus on the psychophysiological mechanisms involved.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Clinical depression is a risk factor for cardiac mortality in patients with coronary heart disease. High QT interval variability is a risk factor for arrhythmic events, including sudden cardiac death. The purpose of this study was to determine whether depression is associated with increased QT variability in patients recovering from myocardial infarction. METHODS: Twenty patients with major depression recovering from a recent myocardial infarction were matched with 20 nondepressed post-myocardial infarction patients on age and sex, and all underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring. RESULTS: There were no differences between groups on average heart rate, heart rate variability, or other electrocardiographic measures. However, the QT interval showed significantly greater variability in the depressed than in the nondepressed group, especially at midnight and at 6:00 AM. CONCLUSIONS: Depressed post-myocardial infarction patients may be at greater risk for sudden cardiac death as a result of abnormalities in ventricular repolarization. More work is needed to determine the clinical and prognostic significance of QT variability in these patients.},

abstract = {Background--Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is associated with adverse prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), yet the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. We hypothesized that compared with exercise/pharmacological stress-induced myocardial ischemia (PSIMI) that is secondary to the atherosclerotic burden of CAD, MSIMI is primarily due to vasomotor changes. Methods and Results--Patients with angiographically documented CAD underwent 99mTc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest and following both mental and physical stress testing, performed on separate days. The severity and extent of CAD were quantified using the Gensini and Sullivan scores. Peripheral arterial tonometry (Itamar Inc) was used to assess the digital microvascular tone during mental stress as a ratio of pulse wave amplitude during speech compared with baseline. Measurements were made in a discovery sample (n=225) and verified in a replication sample (n=159). In the pooled (n=384) sample, CAD severity and extent scores were not significantly different between those with and without MSIMI, whereas they were greater in those with compared with those without PSIMI (P {\textless} 0.04 for all). The peripheral arterial tonometry ratio was lower in those with compared with those without MSIMI (0.55Â±0.36 versus 0.76Â±0.52, P=0.009). In a multivariable analysis, the peripheral arterial tonometry ratio was the only independent predictor of MSIMI (P=0.009), whereas angiographic severity and extent of CAD independently predicted PSIMI. Conclusions--The degree of digital microvascular constriction, and not the angiographic burden of CAD, is associated with MSIMI. Varying causes of MSIMI compared with PSIMI may require different therapeutic interventions that require further study.},

abstract = {Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a relatively common condition, with a 7{\%}to 9{\%}lifetime prevalence in US civilians and a 15 {\%} to 19 {\%} lifetime prevalence in combat veterans. 1 Neurobiological dysregulation of autonomic nervous system pathways involved in the stress response has long been considered a hallmark of the abnormal physiologic processes and clinical presentation of PTSD. Common symptoms of PTSD, such as intrusions and hyperarousal, are likely mediated by the autonomic nervous system. Furthermore, autonomic dysregulation, indexed by low heart rate variability (HRV), is a consistent correlate of PTSD symptoms and may improve when PTSD is in remission. 2 Although PTSD by definition is a consequence of a traumatic event, not every person exposed to trauma develops the condition. 3 However, our ability to predict vulnerability to PTSD is limited, and this issue remains an important topic of exploration. If we knew how to identify at-risk individuals, then we could devise preventive interventions for such people in the armed services before deployment that might prevent PTSD or ameliorate its clinical course. Treatment with 2 main classes of pharmacologic therapies potentially influencing stress systems response ($\beta$-blockers and systemic corticosteroids) has been attempted immediately after trauma exposure. However, a recent Cochrane review 4 found that only hydrocortisone administration immediately after trauma had sufficient evidence to protect individuals from the development of PTSD, with a number needed to treat ranging from 7 to 13. Decisions to administer such agents should be based on careful evaluation of risks and benefits given possible adverse effects, such as immunosuppression. Behavioral interventions, such as cognitive therapy, would also be applicable and are low risk, but they are costly and time consuming; thus, careful risk stratification would again be necessary. Previous studies 3 have shown that higher heart rate and cortisol sensitivity in individuals who experience trauma, measured immediately after exposure, predict subsequent PTSD development. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, no previous studies have evaluated},

Correlations between various social support and criterion measures are simulated in order to demonstrate the consequences of choosing a measure with low reliability. Scale developers reported reliability data for 19 of the reviewed measures. Internal consistency coefficients ranged from .31 to .98. Test-retest coefficients ranged from .22 to .96. At least some validity documentation was available for 13 of the scales. Discriminant validity evidence, however, is almost universally absent.

abstract = {Background: Recent studies have shown that depressive disorder is associated with impaired baroreceptor or baroreflex sensitivity, which is proposed to be a predisposing factor for sudden death in patients with manifest cardiac disease. These studies have not evaluated the afferent and efferent components of the cardiac baroreflex loop or other baroreflex mechanisms that regulate target processes (cardiac metabolism and blood pressure variability) related to the impairment. The objective of this study was to gain more insight into autonomic functioning in depressive disorder to more fully examine the potential basis for increased cardiac mortality. Methods: The subjects were 28 women and men with unipolar major depression who were taking antidepressant medications and who were in partial remission and free of cardiovascular or other serious disease, and 28 healthy control subjects matched for sex, age, and ethnicity. The two samples were compared for negative affective dispositions (anger expression, hostility, defensiveness, anxiety), spontaneous (closed-loop) baroreflex activity, heart rate, heart rate variability, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate-systolic blood pressure double product under resting conditions. Results: Depressed patients showed a general disposition to anger suppression coupled with higher hostility and anxiety, and lower defensiveness. The patients showed higher general sympathetic activity (high levels of blood pressure, low-frequency heart rate variability) and lower parasympathetic-related activity (high heart rate and reduced high frequency heart rate variability) with affected cardiac metabolism estimated by the double product. Depressed patients had lower baroreflex sensitivity related to a higher gain of the afferent component of the baroreflex without respective gain adjustment of its efferent component (reflex gain 'de-afferentation'). It was coupled with a compensatory higher number of effective baroreflex reactions (reflex gating 're-afferentation'). Antidepressant agents and depressed mood had additional independent effects on baroreflex sensitivity through the efferent component of the cardiac baroreflex loop. Conclusions: The data indicate that different baroreflex components and mechanisms may be impaired in patients with depression and may contribute to their increased cardiac risk. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Anger is associated with cardiovascular stress reactivity; however, little is known about the effect of suppressed anger in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). We examined whether patients with CAD who suppress their anger are at risk of adverse events. At baseline, 644 patients with CAD completed measures of anger, anger-in (reluctance to express anger), and Type D personality (tendency to experience distress and to be inhibited). The combination of high anger and anger-in scores was used to identify the presence of suppressed anger. The end points were major adverse cardiac events (a composite of death, myocardial infarction, and revascularization) and cardiac death/myocardial infarction. After an average follow-up of 6.3 years (range 5 to 10), 126 patients (20{\%}) had experienced a major adverse cardiac event, and 59 (9{\%}) had experienced cardiac death or myocardial infarction. Anger (p = 0.009) and suppressed anger (p = 0.011) were associated with future major adverse cardiac events, but these associations were no longer significant after adjustment for clinical characteristics. However, suppressed anger remained associated with the more rigorous end point of cardiac death or myocardial infarction (odds ratio 2.87, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.15 to 7.15, p = 0.024) after controlling for decreased systolic function, poor exercise tolerance, extent of CAD, and revascularization. Anger alone was not independently associated with this end point. Patients with a Type D personality had a fourfold rate of suppressed anger, and an adjustment for a Type D personality attenuated the observed association between suppressed anger and adverse cardiac events. In conclusion, patients with CAD who suppress their anger were at increased risk of adverse cardiac events, and this was accounted for by individual differences in Type D personality. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This population-based cohort study aimed to determine the association between depression of varying severity and risk for CVD and to study the effect of concomitant anxious distress on this association. METHODS We utilized data from a longitudinal cohort study of mental health, work and relations among adults (20-64 years), with a total of 10,443 individuals. Depression and anxious distress were assessed using psychiatric rating scales and defined according to DSM-5. Outcomes were register-based and self-reported cardiovascular diseases. FINDINGS Overall increased odds ratios of 1.5 to 2.6 were seen for the different severity levels of depression, with the highest adjusted OR for moderate depression (OR 2.1 (95{\%} CI 1.3, 3.5). Similar odds ratios were seen for sub-groups of CVD: ischemic/hypertensive heart disease and stroke, 2.4 (95{\%} CI 1.4, 3.9) and OR 2.1 (95{\%}CI 1.2, 3.8) respectively. Depression with anxious distress as a specifier of severity showed OR of 2.1 (95{\%} CI 1.5, 2.9) for CVD. CONCLUSION This study found that severity level of depression seems to be of significance for increased risk of CVD among depressed persons, although not in a dose-response manner which might be obscured due to treatment of depression. Further, we found a higher risk of CVD among depressed individuals with symptoms of anxious distress.},

Clinical studies of patients with implantable defibrillators demonstrate that anger can trigger ventricular arrhythmias. Long-term negative emotions also increase vulnerability to arrhythmias. Mechanisms linking anger and arrhythmias include autonomic changes, which alter repolarization, possibly enhanced in patients with sympathetic denervation, which in turn trigger potentially lethal polymorphic ventricular tachycardias. Interventions which decrease negative emotions and resultant autonomic responses may be therapeutic in patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators.},

It is unclear whether antidepressant treatment improves long-term depression status and cardiac prognosis. Aims: To evaluate the effects of antidepressant treatment compared with usual care in an effectiveness study. Method: In a multicentre randomised controlled trial, 2177 myocardial infarction patients were evaluated for ICD-10 depression and randomised to intervention (n=209) or care as usual (n=122). Both arms were evaluated at 18 months post-myocardial infarction for long-term depression status and new cardiac events. Results: No differences were observed between intervention and control groups in mean scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (11.0, s.d.=7.5 v. 10.2, s.d.=5.1, P=0.45) or presence of ICD-10 depression (30.5 v. 32.1{\%}, P=0.68).The cardiac event rate was 14{\%} among the intervention group and 13{\%} among controls (OR=1.07,95{\%} CI 0.57-2.00). Conclusions: Antidepressant treatment did not alter long-term depression post-myocardial infarction status or improve cardiac prognosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Low heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of cardiac autonomic dysfunction, has been associated with major risk factors of cognitive impairment. Yet, the direct association of HRV with cognitive function remains relatively unexplored, particularly in midlife. METHODS In 2005, 2 measures of short-term HRV, the SD of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), were calculated for participants of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study, and then categorized into quartiles. Five years later, 3 cognitive tests were administered for verbal memory ("Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test", RAVLT, range 0-15), processing speed ("Digit Symbol Substitution Test", DSST, range 0-133), and executive function ("Stroop interference"). RESULTS Two thousand one hundred and eighteen participants (57.7{\%} female, 42.2{\%} Black) with a mean baseline age of 45.3 years were included in this analysis. In demographic-adjusted models, compared to participants with quartile 1 SDNN (lowest quartile), participants in the upper quartiles of SDNN scored better on the DSST (quartile 4: $\beta$ = 1.83 points better, P = 0.03; and quartile 3: $\beta$ = 1.95 points better, P = 0.03) and on the stroop (quartile 3: $\beta$ = 1.19 points better, P {\textless} 0.05; and quartile2: $\beta$ = 1.44 points better, P = 0.02). After adjusting for behavioral and cardiovascular risk factors, higher quartile SDNN remained significantly associated with better stroop score (quartile 3: $\beta$ = 1.21 points better, P = 0.04; and quartile 2: $\beta$ = 1.72 points better, P {\textless} 0.01) but not with DSST. There was no association between quartile of RMSSD and cognitive function, from fully adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that higher quartile SDDN is associated with better executive function in midlife, above, and beyond cardiovascular risk factors.},

abstract = {Background-Among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), depression is both common and underrecognized. The association of different manifestations of depression, somatic and cognitive, with depression recognition and long-term prognosis is poorly understood. Methods and Results-Depression was confirmed in 481 AMI patients enrolled from 21 sites during their index hospitalization with a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score â¥10. Within the PHQ-9, separate somatic and cognitive symptom scores were derived, and the independent association between these domains and the clinical recognition of depression, as documented in the medical records, was evaluated. In a separate multisite AMI registry of 2347 patients, the association between somatic and cognitive depressive symptoms and 4-year all-cause mortality and 1-year all-cause rehospitalization was evaluated. Depression was clinically recognized in 29{\%} (n=140) of patients. Cognitive depressive symptoms (relative risk per SD increase, 1.14; 95{\%} CI, 1.03 to 1.26; Pâ¥0.01) were independently associated with depression recognition, whereas the association for somatic symptoms and recognition (relative risk, 1.04; 95{\%} CI, 0.87 to 1.26; P=0.66) was not significant. However, unadjusted Cox regression analyses found that only somatic depressive symptoms were associated with 4-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR] per SD increase, 1.22; 95{\%} CI, 1.08 to 1.39) or 1-year rehospitalization (HR, 1.22; 95{\%} CI, 1.11 to 1.33), whereas cognitive manifestations were not (HR for mortality, 1.01; 95{\%} CI, 0.89 to 1.14; HR for rehospitalization, 1.01; 95{\%} CI, 0.93 to 1.11). After multivariable adjustment, the association between somatic symptoms and rehospitalization persisted (HR, 1.16; 95{\%} CI, 1.06 to 1.27; P=0.01) but was attenuated for mortality (HR, 1.07; 95{\%} CI, 0.94 to 1.21; P=0.30). Conclusions-Depression after AMI was recognized in fewer than 1 in 3 patients. Although cognitive symptoms were associated with recognition of depression, somatic symptoms were associa ed with long-term outcomes. Comprehensive screening and treatment of both somatic and cognitive symptoms may be necessary to optimize depression recognition and treatment in AMI patients.

abstract = {Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) has been associated with adverse prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but whether this is a uniform finding across different studies has not been described. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies examining the association between MSIMI and adverse outcome events in patients with stable CAD. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases for English language prospective studies of patients with CAD who underwent standardized mental stress testing to determine presence of MSIMI and were followed up for subsequent cardiac events or total mortality. Our outcomes of interest were CAD recurrence, CAD mortality, or total mortality. A summary effect estimate was derived using a fixed-effects meta-analysis model. Only 5 studies, each with a sample size of {\textless}200 patients and fewer than 50 outcome events, met the inclusion criteria. The pooled samples comprised 555 patients with CAD (85{\%} male) and 117 events with a range of follow-up from 35 days to 8.8 years. Pooled analysis showed that MSIMI was associated with a twofold increased risk of a combined end point of cardiac events or total mortality (relative risk 2.24, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.59 to 3.15). No heterogeneity was detected among the studies (Q = 0.39, I2= 0.0{\%}, p = 0.98). In conclusion, although few selected studies have examined the association between MSIMI and adverse events in patients with CAD, all existing investigations point to approximately a doubling of risk. Whether this increased risk is generalizable to the CAD population at large and varies in patient subgroups warrant further investigation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Depression is common in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and is a risk factor for cardiac morbidity and mortality in these patients. Depression is associated with autonomic nervous system dysfunction, which may at least partially explain this increased risk. Low heart rate variability (HRV), which reflects excessive sympathetic and/or inadequate parasympathetic modulation of heart rate, is a strong predictor of mortality in patients with CHD. Most studies-both in patients with stable CHD and in patients with a recent acute coronary event-have found HRV to be lower in depressed patients than in their nondepressed counterparts. This manuscript provides an overview of this literature and concludes that HRV may account for a substantial part of the risk associated with depression in CHD.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To investigate sex-specific vascular mechanisms for mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI). APPROACH AND RESULTS Baseline data from a prospective cohort study of 678 patients with coronary artery disease underwent myocardial perfusion imaging before and during a public speaking stressor. The rate-pressure product response was calculated as the difference between the maximum value during the speech minus the minimum value during rest. Peripheral vasoconstriction by peripheral arterial tonometry was calculated as the ratio of pulse wave amplitude during the speech over the resting baseline; ratios {\textless}1 indicate a vasoconstrictive response. MSIMI was defined as percent of left ventricle that was ischemic and as a dichotomous variable. Men (but not women) with MSIMI had a higher rate-pressure product response than those without MSIMI (6500 versus 4800 mm Hg bpm), whereas women (but not men) with MSIMI had a significantly lower peripheral arterial tonometry ratio than those without MSIMI (0.5 versus 0.8). In adjusted linear regression, each 1000-U increase in rate-pressure product response was associated with 0.32{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.22-0.42) increase in inducible ischemia among men, whereas each 0.10-U decrease in peripheral arterial tonometry ratio was associated with 0.23{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.11-0.35) increase in inducible myocardial ischemia among women. Results were independent of conventional stress-induced myocardial ischemia. CONCLUSIONS Women and men have distinct cardiovascular reactivity mechanisms for MSIMI. For women, stress-induced peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress, and not increased hemodynamic workload, is associated with MSIMI, whereas for men, it is the opposite. Future studies should examine these pathways on long-term outcomes.},

abstract = {Notes that depression in patients with cardiovascular disease is a significant risk factor for developing symptomatic and fatal ischemic heart disease. Moreover, depressed patients have a higher than expected rate of sudden cardiovascular death. Therefore, appropriate treatment of patients with depression and cardiovascular disease cannot be restricted to considerations of either depression or cardiovascular disease in isolation. The tricyclic antidepressants have various effects on the cardiovascular system, including Type IA antiarrhythmic activity that has been associated with an increased risk of mortality in post-myocardial infarction patients. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are not associated with adverse cardiac effects. On the basis of this favorable cardiovascular profile, the SSRIs should therefore be the preferred choice for the treatment of most patients with comorbid depression and cardiovascular disease. Investigation of putative pathophysiologic mechanisms linking depression and cardiovascular mortality, such as the role of platelet activation, will form the basis for further investigation of antidepressant treatments in order to establish if the antidepressants have a beneficial effect on the prognosis of cardiovascular diseases.

Although the therapeutic approach of HRVB is promising in various stress-related disorders, it has only been offered on a regular basis in a few mental health treatment settings. AIM To analyse the efficacy of HRV biofeedback as an additional psychophysiological treatment for depression and PTSD. METHOD Systematic review with search terms HRV, biofeedback, PTSD, depression, panic disorder and anxiety disorder. RESULTS Our search of the literature yielded 789 studies. After critical appraisal using the GRADE method, we selected 6 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 4 relevant studies. The RCTs with control groups 'treatment as usual' and muscle relaxation training revealed significant clinical efficacy and better results than codntrol conditions after 4 to 8 weeks training. CONCLUSION Although this systematic review shows the popularity of HRV in literature, it does not indicate that HRVB really has been reviewed systematically. Significant outcomes of this limited number of randomised studies indicate there may be a clinical improvement when HRVB training is integrated into treatment of PTSD and depression, particularly when this integration procedure is combined with psychotherapy. More research needs to be done with larger groups and further efforts are needed to integrate HRVB into treatment of stress-related disorders in psychiatry. Future research also needs to focus on the psychophysiological mechanisms involved.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Major depression is a common problem in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and is associated with an increased risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality. It is not known whether treating depression will improve medical prognosis in patients with CHD. Depression is also associated with elevated heart rate and reduced heart rate variability (HRV), which are known risk factors for cardiac morbidity and mortality that may explain the increased risk associated with depression. The purpose of this study was to determine whether treatment for depression with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is associated with decreased heart rate or increased HRV. METHODS Thirty depressed patients with stable CHD, classified as either mildly or moderately to severely depressed, received up to 16 sessions of CBT. The 24-hour heart rate and HRV were measured in these patients and in 22 medically comparable nondepressed controls before and after treatment of the depressed patients. RESULTS Average heart rate and daytime rMSSD (reflecting mostly parasympathetic activity) improved significantly in the severely depressed patients, but remained unchanged in the mildly depressed and the control patients. However, only rMSSD improved to a level comparable to the control patients. None of the remaining indices of HRV showed improvement. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that treating depression with CBT may reduce heart rate and increase short-term HRV. Thus, CBT may have a beneficial effect on a risk factor for mortality in depressed patients with coronary heart disease. A randomized, controlled study is needed to confirm these findings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Depression among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is prevalent and associated with an adverse quality of life and prognosis. Despite recommendations from some national organizations to screen for depression, it is unclear whether treatment of depression in patients with AMI is associated with better outcomes. We aimed to determine whether the prognosis of patients with treated versus untreated depression differs. METHODS The TRIUMPH study (Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients' Health Status) is an observational multicenter cohort study that enrolled 4062 patients aged â¥18 years with AMI between April 11, 2005, and December 31, 2008, from 24 US hospitals. Research coordinators administered the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) during the index AMI admission. Depression was defined by a PHQ-9 score of â¥10. Depression was categorized as treated if there was documentation of a discharge diagnosis, medication prescribed for depression, or referral for counseling, and as untreated if none of these 3 criteria was documented in the medical records despite a PHQ score â¥10. One-year mortality was compared between patients with AMI having: (1) no depression (PHQ-9{\textless}10; reference); (2) treated depression; and (3) untreated depression adjusting for demographics, AMI severity, and clinical factors. RESULTS Overall, 759 (18.7{\%}) patients met PHQ-9 criteria for depression and 231 (30.4{\%}) were treated. In comparison with 3303 patients without depression, the 231 patients with treated depression had 1-year mortality rates that were not different (6.1{\%} versus 6.7{\%}; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.12; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.63-1.99). In contrast, the 528 patients with untreated depression had higher 1-year mortality in comparison with patients without depression (10.8{\%} versus 6.1{\%}; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.91; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.39-2.62). CONCLUSIONS Although depression in patients with AMI is associated with increased long-term mortality, this association may be confined to patients with untreated depression.},

abstract = {Objective Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and despite important advances in our understanding of this disorder, the underlying mechanisms remain under investigation. Recently, increased attention has been placed on the role of behavioral factors such as emotional stress on CAD risk. Brain areas involved in memory and the stress response, including medial prefrontal cortex, insula, and parietal cortex, also have outputs to the peripheral cardiovascular system. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of mental stress on brain and cardiac function in patients with CAD. Methods CAD patients (N = 170) underwent cardiac imaging with [Tc-99m] sestamibi single-photon emission tomography at rest and during a public speaking mental stress task. On another day, they underwent imaging of the brain with [O-15] water positron emission tomography (PET) during mental stress (arithmetic and public speaking) and control conditions. Results Patients with mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia showed increased activation with stress in anterior cingulate, inferior frontal gyrus, and parietal cortex (p {\textless}.005). This was seen with both arithmetic stress and public speaking stress. Arithmetic stress was additionally associated with left insula activation, and public speaking with right pre/postcentral gyrus and middle temporal gyrus activation (p {\textless}.005). Conclusions These findings suggest that mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is associated with activation in brain areas involved in the stress response and autonomic regulation of the cardiovascular system. Altered brain reactivity to stress could possibly represent a mechanism through which stress leads to increased risk of CAD-related morbidity and mortality.},

abstract = {The physiological reaction to psychological stress, involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical and sympatho-adrenomedullary axes, is well characterized, but its link to cardiovascular disease risk is not well understood. Epidemiological data show that chronic stress predicts the occurrence of coronary heart disease (CHD). Employees who experience work-related stress and individuals who are socially isolated or lonely have an increased risk of a first CHD event. In addition, short-term emotional stress can act as a trigger of cardiac events among individuals with advanced atherosclerosis. A stress-specific coronary syndrome, known as transient left ventricular apical ballooning cardiomyopathy or stress (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy, also exists. Among patients with CHD, acute psychological stress has been shown to induce transient myocardial ischemia and long-term stress can increase the risk of recurrent CHD events and mortality. Applications of the 'stress concept' (the understanding of stress as a risk factor and the use of stress management) in the clinical settings have been relatively limited, although the importance of stress management is highlighted in European guidelines for cardiovascular disease prevention. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {IMPORTANCE Disrupted autonomic nervous system functioning as measured by heart rate variability (HRV) has been associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is not clear, however, whether reduced HRV before trauma exposure contributes to the risk for development of PTSD. OBJECTIVE To examine whether HRV before combat deployment is associated with increased risk of a PTSD diagnosis after deployment when accounting for deployment-related combat exposure. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Between July 14, 2008, and May 24, 2012, active-duty Marines were assessed 1 to 2 months before a combat deployment and again 4 to 6 months after their return. The first phase of the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS-I) included 1415 male Marines, 59 of whom developed PTSD after deployment. Participants in the second phase of the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS-II) included 745 male Marines, 25 of whom developed PTSD after deployment. Analysis was conducted from November 25, 2013, to April 16, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Predeployment HRVwas measured via finger photoplethysmography during a 5-minute period of rest. Frequency-domain measures of HRV were generated. Diagnosis of PTSD was determined using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. RESULTS After accounting for deployment-related combat exposure, lower HRV before deployment as measured by an increased low-frequency (LF) to high-frequency (HF) ratio of HRV was associated with risk of PTSD diagnosis after deployment (combined MRS-I and MRS-II cohortmeta-analysis odds ratio, 1.47; 95{\%}CI, 1.10-1.98; P = .01). The prevalence of postdeployment PTSD was higher in participants with high predeployment LF:HF ratios (15.8{\%} [6 of 38 participants]) compared with participants who did not have high LF:HF ratios (3.7{\%}[78 of 2122 participants]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This prospective longitudinal study provides initial and modest evidence that an altered state of autonomic nervous system functioning contributes to PTSD vulnerability, taking into account other key risk factors. If these findings are replicated, interventions that change autonomic nervous system function may open novel opportunities for prevention and treatment of PTSD.},

abstract = {Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with coronary heart disease (CHD), but the mechanisms are unclear. The presence of MDD may increase CHD risk by affecting microvascular circulation. It is also plausible that genetic factors influencing MDD may overlap with those for CHD. We sought to examine the relationship between MDD and coronary flow reserve (CFR), the ratio of maximum flow during stress to flow at rest measured in milliliters per minute per gram of tissue. Methods We examined 289 male middle-aged twins, including 106 twins (53 twin pairs) discordant for a lifetime history of MDD and 183 control twins (unrelated to any twins in the experimental group) without MDD. To calculate CFR, we used positron emission tomography with nitrogen 13 (13N) ammonia to evaluate myocardial blood flow at rest and after adenosine stress. A standard perfusion defect score was also used to assess myocardial ischemia. Results There was no difference in myocardial ischemia between twins with and without MDD. Among the dizygotic twin pairs discordant for MDD, the CFR was 14{\%} lower in the twins with MDD than in their brothers without MDD (2.36 vs 2.74) (P = .03). This association was not present in the monozygotic discordant pairs who were genetically matched (2.86 vs 2.64) (P = .19). The zygosity-MDD interaction after adjustment was significant (P = .006). The CFR in the dizygotic twins with MDD was also lower than in the control twins. Conclusions Our results provide evidence for a shared genetic pathway between MDD and microvascular dysfunction. Common pathophysiologic processes may link MDD and early atherosclerosis.},

abstract = {Stressful life events are an important cause of psychopathology. Humans exposed to aversive or stressful experiences show considerable inter-individual heterogeneity in their responses. However, the majority does not develop stress-related psychiatric disorders. The dynamic processes encompassing positive and functional adaptation in the face of significant adversity have been broadly defined as resilience. Traditionally, the assessment of resilience has been confined to self-report measures, both within the general community and putative high-risk populations. Although this approach has value, it is highly susceptible to subjective bias and may not capture the dynamic nature of resilience, as underlying construct. Recognizing the obvious benefits of more objective measures of resilience, research in the field has just started investigating the predictive value of several potential biological markers. This review provides an overview of theoretical views and empirical evidence suggesting that individual differences in heart rate variability (HRV), a surrogate index of resting cardiac vagal outflow, may underlie different levels of resilience toward the development of stress-related psychiatric disorders. Following this line of thought, recent studies describing associations between regional brain morphometric characteristics and resting state vagally-mediated HRV are summarized. Existing studies suggest that the structural morphology of the anterior cingulated cortex (ACC), particularly its cortical thickness, is implicated in the expression of individual differences in HRV. These findings are discussed in light of emerging structural neuroimaging research, linking morphological characteristics of the ACC to psychological traits ascribed to a high-resilient profile and abnormal structural integrity of the ACC to the psychophysiological expression of stress-related mental health consequences. We conclude that a multidisciplinary approach integrating brain structural imaging with HRV monitoring could offer novel perspectives about brain-body pathways in resilience and adaptation to psychological stress.},

Objective: To determine whether mortality and recurrent infarction are reduced by treatment of depression and LPSS with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), supplemented with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant when indicated, in patients enrolled within 28 days after MI. Design, Setting, and Patients: Randomized clinical trial conducted from October 1996 to April 2001 in 2481 MI patients (1084 women, 1397 men) enrolled from 8 clinical centers. Major or minor depression was diagnosed by modified Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria and severity by the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD); LPSS was determined by the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease Patients (ENRICHD) Social Support Instrument (ESSI). Random allocation was to usual medical care or CBT-based psychosocial intervention. Intervention: Cognitive behavior therapy was initiated at a median of 17 days after the index MI for a median of 11 individual sessions throughout 6 months, plus group therapy when feasible, with SSRIs for patients scoring higher than 24 on the HRSD or having a less than 50{\%} reduction in Beck Depression Inventory scores after 5 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: Composite primary end point of death or recurrent MI; secondary outcomes included change in HRSD (for depression) or ESSI scores (for LPSS) at 6 months. Results: Improvement in psychosocial outcomes at 6 months favored treatment: mean (SD) change in HRSD score, -10.1 (7.8) in the depression and psychosocial intervention group vs -8.4 (7.7) in the depression and usual care group (P{\textless}.001); mean (SD) change in ESSI score, 5.1 (5.9) in the LPSS and psychosocial intervention group vs 3.4 (6.0) in the LPSS and usual care group (P{\textless}.001). After an average follow-up of 29 months, there was no significant difference in event-free survival between usual care (75.9{\%}) and psychosocial intervention (75.8{\%}). There were also no differences in survival between the psychosocial intervention and usual care arms in any of the 3 psychosocial risk groups (depression, LPSS, and depression and LPSS patients). Conclusions: The intervention did not increase event-free survival. The intervention improved depression and social isolation, although the relative improvement in the psychosocial intervention group compared with the usual care group was less than expected due to substantial improvement in usual care patients.},

abstract = {Background: Mental stressâinduced myocardial ischemia is a frequent phenomenon in patients with coronary artery disease. Women with coronary artery disease tend to have more mental stressâinduced myocardial ischemia and more chest pain/anginal symptoms than men, but whether the association between mental stressâinduced myocardial ischemia and angina burden differs in women and men is unknown. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with experimental manipulation of 950 individuals with stable coronary artery disease. Chest pain/angina frequency in the previous 4 weeks was assessed with the Seattle Angina Questionnaire's angina-frequency subscale. Mental stressâinduced myocardial ischemia was assessed with myocardial perfusion imaging during mental stress (standardized public speaking task). Presence of mental stressâinduced myocardial ischemia was based on expert readers and established criteria. A conventional (exercise or pharmacologic) stress test was used as a control condition. Results: Overall, 338 individuals (37{\%}) reported angina; 112 (12{\%}) developed mental stressâinduced myocardial ischemia, and 256 (29{\%}) developed conventional stress ischemia. Women who reported angina had almost double the probability to develop mental stressâinduced myocardial ischemia (19{\%} vs 10{\%}, adjusted prevalence rate ratio, 1.90; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.04-3.46), whereas there was no such difference in men (11{\%} vs 11{\%}, adjusted prevalence rate ratio, 1.09; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.66-1.82). No association was found between angina symptoms and conventional stress ischemia for women or men. Results for ischemia as a continuous variable were similar. Conclusions: In women, but not in men, anginal symptoms may be a marker of vulnerability toward ischemia induced by psychologic stress. These results highlight the psychosocial origins of angina in women and may have important implications for the management and prognosis of women with angina.},

abstract = {Animal studies demonstrate that maternal touch and contact regulate infant stress, and handling during periods of maternal deprivation attenuates the stress response. To measure the effects of touch on infant stress reactivity during simulated maternal deprivation, 53 dyads were tested in two paradigms: still-face (SF) and still-face with maternal touch (SF+T). Maternal and infant cortisol levels were sampled at baseline, reactivity, and recovery and mother's and infant's cardiac vagal tone were measured during the free play, still-face, and reunion episodes of the procedure. Cortisol reactivity was higher among infants in the SF condition and while cortisol decreased at recovery for infants in the SF+T, it further increased for those in the SF. Vagal tone showed a greater suppression when SF was not accompanied by maternal touch. Touch synchrony during free play was associated with higher infant vagal tone, whereas touch myssynchrony - maternal tactile stimulation while the infant gaze averts - correlated with higher maternal and infant cortisol. In humans, as in mammals, the provision of touch during moments of maternal unavailability reduces infants' physiological reactivity to stress. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors.

abstract = {There is a bidirectional relationship between affective disorders and cardiovascular abnormalities, often described as a downward spiral, whereas major depressive disorders (MDD, and anxiety disorders) significantly increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVD); CVD are also associated with increased risk of developing MDD (and anxiety disorders). Moreover, the prognosis and progression of CVD is significantly worsened in the presence of MDD. Heart rate variability (HRV) has often been suggested as a potential mediator in this comorbidity. In this review, we discuss HRV alterations in MDD. However, we mainly focus on the direct relationship between HRV alterations and psychiatric symptoms, rather than its relationship with CVD, as this has been reviewed elsewhere. After a general introduction to HRV and how it can be measured, we review how HRV is altered in MDD. We subsequently describe how antidepressant drugs affect HRV, showing that some classes (such as tricyclics) generally worsen HRV, whereas others (most notably selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) have a more positive influence. We also review the effects of several other treatments, with a special focus on vagal nerve stimulation, finishing with some further considerations and recommendation for further research, both in humans and animals., Copyright (C) 2018 YEAR Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

@article{Ogilvie2016,
abstract = {Heart failure (HF) is a major source of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Psychosocial factors have frequently been studied as risk factors for coronary heart disease but not for HF. Methods and Results-We examined the relationship between psychological status and incident HF among 6782 individuals from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Anger, anxiety, chronic stress, depressive symptoms, and hostility were measured using validated scales, and physician reviewers adjudicated incident HF events. Cox proportional hazards models were used to adjust for relevant demographic, behavioral, and physiological covariates. Interactions by age, race, sex, and self-reported health were examined in exploratory analyses. During a mean follow-up of 9.3 years, 242 participants developed incident HF. There was no association between psychosocial factors and HF hazard ratios (95{\%} confidence interval) for the highest versus lowest quartile: anger=1.14 (0.81-1.60), anxiety=0.74 (0.51-1.07), chronic stress = 1.25 (0.90-1.72), depressive symptoms= 1.19 (0.76-1.85), and hostility = 0.95 (0.62-1.42). In exploratory analysis, among the participants reporting fair/poor health at baseline, those reporting high versus low levels of anxiety, chronic stress, and depressive symptoms had 2-fold higher risk of incident HF, but there was no association for those with good/very good/excellent self-reported health. Conclusions-Overall, these psychosocial factors were not significantly associated with incident HF. However, for participants reporting poor health at baseline, there was evidence that anxiety, chronic stress, and depressive symptoms were associated with increased risk of HF. Future research with greater statistical power is necessary to replicate these findings and seek explanations.},

abstract = {The notion that psychological states can influence physical health is hardly new, and perhaps nowhere has the mind-body connection been better studied than in cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recently, large prospective epidemiologic studies and smaller basic science studies have firmly established a connection between CVD and several psychological conditions, including depression, chronic psychological stress, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and anxiety. In addition, numerous clinical trials have been conducted to attempt to prevent or lessen the impact of these conditions on cardiovascular health. In this article, we review studies connecting depression, stress/PTSD, and anxiety to CVD, focusing on findings from the last 5 years. For each mental health condition, we first examine the epidemiologic evidence establishing a link with CVD. We then describe studies of potential underlying mechanisms and finally discuss treatment trials and directions for future research.},

abstract = {A vast body of literature has revealed that dysregulation of the hypothalamicâpituitaryâadrenal (HPA) stress axis is associated with etiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). There are many ways that the dysregulation of the HPA axis can be assessed: by sampling diurnal basal secretion and/or in response to a stress task, pharmacological challenge, and awakening. Here, we focus on the association between cortisol awakening response (CAR), as one index of HPA axis function, and MDD, given that the nature of this association is particularly unclear. Indeed, in the following selective review, we attempt to reconcile sometimes-divergent evidence of the role of CAR in the pathway to depression. We first examine association of CAR with psychological factors that have been linked with increased vulnerability to develop depression. Then, we summarize the findings regarding the CAR profile in those with current depression, and evaluate evidence for the role of CAR following depression resolution and continued vulnerability. Finally, we showcase longitudinal studies showing the role of CAR in predicting depression onset and recurrence. Overall, the studies reveal an important, but complex, association between CAR and vulnerability to depression.},

@misc{Sgoifo2015,
abstract = {Depression occurs in people of all ages across all world regions; it is the second leading cause of disability and its global burden increased by 37.5{\%} between 1990 and 2010. Autonomic changes are often found in altered mood states and appear to be a central biological substrate linking depression to a number of physical dysfunctions. Alterations of autonomic nervous system functioning that promotes vagal withdrawal are reflected in reductions of heart rate variability (HRV) indexes. Reduced HRV characterizes emotional dysregulation, decreased psychological flexibility and defective social engagement, which in turn are linked to prefrontal cortex hypoactivity. Altogether, these pieces of evidence support the idea that HRV might represent a useful endophenotype for psychological/physical comorbidities, and its routine application should be advised to assess the efficacy of prevention/intervention therapies in a number of psychosomatic and psychiatric dysfunctions. Further research, also making use of appropriate animal models, could provide a significant support to this point of view and possibly help to identify appropriate antidepressant therapies that do not interefere with physical health.},
