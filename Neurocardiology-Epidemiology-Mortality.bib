abstract = {Objectives: This study sought to assess the long-term predictive power of depressed baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) among post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients with preserved left ventricular function. Background: Risk stratification after MI is primarily performed by identifying patients with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) because of their greater mortality. Autonomic markers can help refining risk stratification. Depressed BRS (<3 ms/mm Hg) correlated with cardiovascular mortality in 1,284 post-MI patients during a 21-month follow-up in the multicenter ATRAMI (Autonomic Tone and Reflexes After Myocardial Infarction) study, but had no significant predictive power in patients with LVEF >35% or above age 65 years. Methods: Two hundred forty-four consecutive post-MI patients (age 59 ± 10 years) with LVEF >35% (average 54 ± 8%) were enrolled. They underwent a complete assessment, including BRS 4 weeks after MI. Results: During a 5-year mean follow-up, 14 (5.7%) patients died of cardiovascular causes. Multivariate analysis identified BRS (p = 0.0001), but not LVEF and age, as predictive of cardiovascular mortality. The relative risk (95% confidence interval [CI]) for depressed BRS was 11.4 (95% CI 3.3 to 39.0) for the overall population, 19.6 (95% CI 4.1 to 94.8) for patients ≤65 years, and 7.2 (95% CI 1.3 to 39.9) for patients above age 65. Conclusions: Even among the large number of low-risk post-MI patients with preserved left ventricular function, depressed BRS identifies, independently of age, a subgroup at long-term high risk for cardiovascular mortality in which more aggressive preventive strategies should be considered. {\textcopyright} 2007 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {AIMS:The density HRV parameter Dyx is a new heart rate variability (HRV) measure based on multipole analysis of the Poincar{\'{e}} plot obtained from RR interval time series, deriving information from both the time and frequency domain. Preliminary results have suggested that the parameter may provide new predictive information on mortality in survivors of acute myocardial infarction (MI). This study compares the prognostic significance of Dyx to that of traditional linear and nonlinear measures of HRV.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:In the Nordic ICD pilot study, patients with an acute MI were screened with 2D echocardiography and 24-hour Holter recordings. The study was designed to assess the power of several HRV measures to predict mortality. Dyx was tested in a subset of 206 consecutive Danish patients with analysable Holter recordings. After a median follow-up of 8.5 years 70 patients had died. Of all traditional and multipole HRV parameters, reduced Dyx was the most powerful predictor of all-cause mortality (HR 2.4; CI 1.5 to 3.8; P < 0.001). After adjustment for known risk markers, such as age, diabetes, ejection fraction, previous MI and hypertension, Dyx remained an independent predictor of mortality (P = 0.02). Reduced Dyx also predicted cardiovascular death (P < 0.01) and sudden cardiovascular death (P = 0.05). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, Dyx significantly predicted mortality in patients both with and without impaired left ventricular systolic function (P < 0.0001).\n\nCONCLUSION:The new nonlinear HRV measure Dyx is a promising independent predictor of mortality in a long-term follow-up study of patients surviving a MI, irrespectively of left ventricular systolic function.},

abstract = {Background. Experimental evidence suggests that autonomic markers such as heart-rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) may contribute to post-infarction risk stratification. There are clinical data to support this concept for heart-rate variability. The main objective of the ATRAMI study was to provide prospective data on the additional and independent prognostic value for cardiac mortality of heart-rate variability and BRS in patients after myocardial infarction in whom left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and ventricular arrhythmias were known. Methods. This multicentre international prospective study enrolled 1284 patients with a recent (< 28 days) myocardial infarction, 24 h Holter recording was done to quantify heart-rate variability (measured as standard deviation of normal to normal RR intervals [SDNN]) and ventricular arrhythmias. BRS was calculated from measurement of the rate-pressure response to intravenous phenylephrine. Findings. During 21 (SD 8) months of follow-up, the primary endpoint, cardiac mortality, included 44 cardiac deaths and five non-fatal cardiac arrests. Low values of either heart-rate variability (SDNN < 70 ms) or BRS (< 3.0 ms per mmHg) carried a significant multivariate risk of cardiac mortality (3.2 [95% CI 1.42-7.36] and 2.8 [1.24-6.16], respectively). The association of low SDNN and BRS further increased risk; the 2-year mortality was 17% when both were below the cut-offs and 2% (p < 0.0001) when both were well preserved (SDNN > 105 ms, BRS > 6.1 ms per mmHg). The association of low SDNN or BRS with LVEF below 35% carried a relative risk of 6.7 (3.1-14.6) or 8.7 (4.3-17.6), respectively, compared with patients with LVEF above 35% and less compromised SDNN ≤ 70 ms) and BRS (≤ 3 ms per mmHg). Interpretation. ATRAMI provides clinical evidence that after myocardial infarction the analysis of vagal reflexes has significant prognostic value independently of LVEF and of ventricular arrhythmias acid that it significantly adds to the prognostic value of heart-rate variability.},
