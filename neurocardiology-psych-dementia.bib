abstract = {BACKGROUND Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is set to become a major health problem with the exponential ageing of the world's population. The association between MCI and autonomic dysfunction, supported by indirect evidence and rich with clinical implications in terms of progression to dementia and increased risk of mortality and falls, has never been specifically demonstrated. AIM To conduct a comprehensive assessment of autonomic function in subjects with MCI by means of power spectral analysis (PSA) of heart rate variability (HRV) at rest and during provocative manoeuvres. METHODS This cross-sectional study involved 80 older outpatients (aged ≥ 65) consecutively referred to a geriatric unit and diagnosed with MCI or normal cognition (controls) based on neuropsychological testing. PSA was performed on 5-minute electrocardiographic recordings under three conditions--supine rest with free breathing (baseline), supine rest with paced breathing at 12 breaths/minute (parasympathetic stimulation), and active standing (orthosympathetic stimulation)--with particular focus on the changes from baseline to stimulation of indices of sympathovagal balance: normalized low frequency (LFn) and high frequency (HFn) powers and the LF/HF ratio. Blood pressure (BP) was measured at baseline and during standing. Given its exploratory nature in a clinical population the study included subjects on medications with a potential to affect HRV. RESULTS There were no significant differences in HRV indices between the two groups at baseline. MCI subjects exhibited smaller physiological changes in all three HRV indices during active standing, consistently with a dysfunction of the orthosympathetic system. Systolic BP after 10 minutes of standing was lower in MCI subjects, suggesting dysautonomia-related orthostatic BP dysregulation. CONCLUSIONS Our study is novel in providing evidence of autonomic dysfunction in MCI. This is associated with orthostatic BP dysregulation and the ongoing follow-up of the study population will determine its prognostic relevance as a predictor of adverse health outcomes.},

abstract = {Ageing is the primary risk factor for cognitive deterioration. Given that the cerebral blood flow (CBF) or regulation of cerebral circulation is attenuated in the elderly, it could be expected that ageing-induced cognitive deterioration may be affected by a decrease in CBF as a result of brain ischemia and energy depletion. CBF regulation associated with cerebral metabolism thus likely plays an important role in the preservation of cognitive function. However, in some specific conditions (e.g. during exercise), change in CBF does not synchronize with that of cerebral metabolism. Our recent study demonstrated that cognitive function was more strongly affected by changes in cerebral metabolism than by changes in CBF during exercise. Therefore, it remains unclear how an alteration in CBF or its regulation affects cognitive function. In this review, I summarize current knowledge on previous investigations providing the possibility of an interaction between regulation of CBF or cerebral metabolism and cognitive function.},

abstract = {Objectives Adaptive physiological stress regulation is rarely studied in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Here we targeted mental fatigability (MF) as a determinant of altered high frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) reactivity in individuals with MCI, and examined frontobasal ganglia circuitry as a neural basis supporting the link between MF and HF-HRV reactivity. Methods We measured mental fatigability and HF-HRV during a 60-minute cognitive stress protocol in 19 individuals with MCI. HF-HRV responses were modeled using a quadratic equation. Resting state functional connectivity of intra- and inter-network frontobasal ganglia circuitry was assessed using blood-oxygen-level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging among seven of the participants. Results Lower MF was associated with faster and greater rebound in U-shape HF-HRV reactivity, which linked to a stronger connectivity between right middle frontal gyrus and left putamen. Conclusions Results suggest that MF may contribute to abnormal physiological stress regulation in MCI, and fronto basal ganglia circuitry may support the link.},

abstract = {Cognitive impairment is prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but its underlying mechanisms are obscure. Here, we test the hypothesis that exaggerated orthostatic blood pressure reduction mediates the effects of renal failure on global cognition and memory. A total of 160 study subjects were recruited, including 80 dialysis patients and 80 controls. Global cognition was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and episodic memory was evaluated using the auditory verbal learning test (AVLT). Autonomic function was evaluated via the low-frequency to high-frequency ratio (LF/HF) through heart rate variability analysis. Compared with the controls, the dialysis patients had significantly lower MoCA and AVLT scores (including learning memory, short recall memory, and delayed recall memory) (all p < 0.001). They also showed exaggerated orthostatic systolic blood pressure reductions (all p ≤ 0.001). The maximum orthostatic systolic blood pressure reduction was independently and negatively associated with short ($\beta$ = -0.05, p = 0.029) and delayed ($\beta$ = -0.05, p = 0.035) recall memory in dialysis patients but not in controls. Mediation analysis demonstrated that maximum orthostatic systolic blood pressure reduction mediates 13.8% of the effect of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on short recall memory (p = 0.04). After adjustment for LF/HF, the negative association between maximum orthostatic blood pressure reduction and short recall score remained significant (p = 0.049), while the association between maximum orthostatic blood pressure reduction and delayed recall score became nonsignificant, with a marginal p value of 0.062. Our study reveals that exaggerated orthostatic blood pressure reduction is a possible explanation for ESRD-associated memory deficits.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of cardiovascular changes (i.e., QT interval, QT dispersion (QTD), heart rate variability (HRV), and other cardiovascular measures) in subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). DESIGN: Each subject underwent clinical and cognitive examination, a structural brain imaging study, echocardioDoppler, electrocardiogram (ECG), HRV analysis using 24-hour ECG monitoring, and 24-hour blood pressure monitoring. SETTING: Community population-based sample of patients admitted to an AD center for investigation of cognitive disturbances. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-three subjects with AD, 39 subjects with MCI, and 29 cognitive healthy subjects (controls) matched for demographic characteristics, hypertensive condition, smoking habits, and laboratory parameters were enrolled consecutively. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical and cognitive examination, structural brain imaging study, echocardioDoppler, ECG, HRV analysis using 24-hour ECG monitoring, and 24-hour blood pressure monitoring. RESULTS: QTD and QT corrected dispersion mean values were significantly higher in patients with AD than in patients with MCI and controls and higher in patients with MCI than in controls. HRV time and domain parameters were lower in patients with AD than in patients with MCI and controls. No difference in other cardiovascular measures was found. QTD and HRV were found to be significantly correlated with the degree of cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: These findings support the presence of a peculiar neuroanatomic dysfunction in patients with AD and MCI that parallels the disease progression. These noninvasive parameters might prove to be powerful predictive tools in the worsening of cognitive function and mortality risk.},

METHODS: Time and frequency heart rate variability (HRV) and visual rating of WMLs were carried out in 42 patients with mild cognitive impairment. RESULTS: After adjustment for relevant demographic and clinical characteristics, including left ventricular mass, reduced HRV indices of parasympathetic (root mean square of successive difference of RR intervals, RMSSD) and sympathetic modulation (low-frequency [LF] power) were associated with increased WML score (RMSSD: B -0.30, 95% CI -0.52 to -0.08, p = .01; LF: B -0.24, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.02, p = .05). In a multiple-adjusted model, RMSSD was the major independent predictor of WMLs (B -0.35, 95% CI -0.57 to -0.13, p = .002). CONCLUSION: The evidence for an independent association of cardiac autonomic dysfunction with WMLs might suggest its role in the pathogenesis of WMLs.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Autonomic dysfunction frequently occurs in the context of Parkinson disease (PD) and may precede onset of motor symptoms. Limited data exist on the prospective association of heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of autonomic function, with PD risk.\nMETHODS: We included 12,162 participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, a community-based cohort, without a diagnosis of PD at baseline (1987-1989) and with available HRV data (mean age = 54 years, 57% women). A 2-minute electrocardiogram was used to measure HRV. Incident PD was identified through 2008 from multiple sources, and adjudicated. Multivariable Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of PD by quartiles of HRV measurements.\nRESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 18 years, we identified 78 incident PD cases. Lower values of the root mean square of successive differences in normal-to-normal R-R intervals (rMSSD) and standard deviation of normal-to-normal R-R intervals (SDNN), markers of parasympathetic activity and total variability, respectively, were associated with higher PD risk during follow-up. In multivariate models, the HR (95% CI) of PD in the bottom quartiles of rMSSD and SDNN compared to the top quartiles were 2.1 (1.0-4.3) and 2.9 (1.4-6.1), respectively. Other measures of cardiac autonomic function, including mean R-R interval and frequency-domain measurements, were not associated with PD risk.\nINTERPRETATION: In this prospective cohort, decreased HRV was associated with an increased risk of PD. Assessment of cardiac autonomic function may help identify individuals at risk for PD.},

Lower quintiles of SDNN (P = 0.01-paced), LF (P = 0.001-paced), and LF:HF ratio (P = 0.049-paced) were significantly associated with lower MOCA scores (during both recording periods), independent of confounders. Sub-domains of MOCA responsible for the relationship were predominantly memory recall and language. Interpretation Reduced HRV is significantly associated with lower cognitive performance at a population level in people aged 50 and older. This further strengthens the relationship between autonomic dysfunction and cognitive disorders.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Low heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of cardiac autonomic dysfunction, has been associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. We examined the association between reduced HRV and incident stroke in a community-based cohort. METHODS The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study measured HRV using 2-minute ECG readings in 12 550 middle-aged adults at baseline (1987-1989). HRV indices were calculated using the SD of RR intervals (SDNN), the mean of all normal RR intervals (meanNN), the root mean square of successive differences of successive RR intervals (RMSSD), low (LF) and high (HF) frequency power, and the LF/HF ratio. All HRV measures were categorized into quintiles. Incident stroke was adjudicated through 2011. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with the lowest HRV quintile as the reference, with and without stratification by prevalent diabetes mellitus. RESULTS Over a median follow-up of 22 years, 816 (6.5%) participants experienced incident stroke. After covariate adjustment, there was no strong evidence of association between HRV and stroke risk. In stratified analyses, the lowest HRV quintile was associated with higher stroke risk compared with the highest quintile for SDNN (HR, 2.0, 95% confidence interval, 1.1-4.0), RMSSD (HR, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.9-3.2), LF (HR, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-3.0), and HF (HR, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.9-3.0) only among people with diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS Lower HRV was associated with higher risk of incident stroke among middle-aged adults with prevalent diabetes mellitus but not among people without diabetes mellitus.},

abstract = {Associations between autonomic nervous system health and cognitive performance have been described in different populations. Autonomic disturbances are a common phenomenon in patients post stroke. Little is known about the relationship between post stroke disturbances of the autonomic nervous system and the commonly occurring disturbances of cognitive functions revealed by victims of stroke. To assess the association between heart rate variability (HRV) and cognitive performance among patients post ischemic stroke and healthy age-matched controls, 13 patients post first-ever ischemic stroke aged 40–80 years and 15 age-matched healthy controls were evaluated. HRV was monitored during sustained handgrip, while breathing at a rate of six breaths per minute, while performing the serial-3 subtraction task sitting at rest, and while cycling. Patients post stroke had greater error rate in the serial-3 subtraction task, and lower HRV (both at rest and during task performance) relative to healthy controls (at rest 26 ms [10–53] vs. 43 ms [29–88]). The HRV of stroke patients showed less sensitivity to changes in testing conditions, and also failed to show the correlation with cognitive performance exhibited by the healthy subjects. Stroke patients experience autonomic nervous system dysfunction in parallel to their motor and cognitive impairments. Too often only the latter receive appropriate treatment consideration in the rehabilitation setting. The current results, and earlier research, point to the importance of focusing clinical attention to the status of the autonomic nervous system, as amelioration of its functioning is likely to enhance motor and cognitive functioning as well.

Here we found that AD-associated neurodegeneration accompanied an overactive anterior cingulate cortex, which in turn resulted in a high level of PNS activity at rest, as well as strong PNS activity withdrawal in response to the mental effort. This discovery provides the first line of evidence to suggest that AD-associated neurodegeneration links to altered PNS regulation during mental effort in older adults, and that the compensatory processes accompanying frontal hyperactivation appear to be responsible for these alterations. ABSTRACT: The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is critical for adaptation to environment demands. PNS can reflect an individual's regulatory capacity of frontal brain regions and has been linked to cognitive capacity. Yet, the relationship of PNS function to cognitive decline and abnormal frontal function that characterize preclinical progression toward Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unclear. Here, we aimed to elucidate the relationship between PNS function and AD-associated neurodegeneration by testing two competing hypotheses involving frontal regions' activity (neurodegeneration vs. compensation). In 38 older human adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or normative cognition, we measured AD-associated neurodegeneration (AD signature cortical thickness; ADSCT), resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging of frontal regions' spontaneous activation, and an electrocardiography measure of PNS (high frequency heart rate variability; HF-HRV). HF-HRV was assessed at rest and during a cognitive task protocol designed to capture HF-HRV reactivity. Higher HF-HRV at rest was significantly related to both more severe AD-associated neurodegeneration (lower ADSCT scores) and worse cognitive ability. Cognitive impairments were also related to greater suppression of HF-HRV reactivity. High activities of the anterior cingulate cortex significantly mediated relationships between ADSCT and both HF-HRV at rest and HF-HRV reactivity. Notably, these relationships were not affected by the clinical phenotype. We show that AD-associated neurodegeneration is associated with altered PNS regulation and that compensatory processes linked to frontal overactivation might be responsible for those alterations. This finding provides the first line of evidence in a new framework for understanding how early-stage AD-associated neurodegeneration affects autonomic regulation.},

abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS Accumulating evidence suggests an association between coronary heart disease and risk for cognitive impairment or dementia, but no study has systematically reviewed this association. Therefore, we summarized the available evidence on the association between coronary heart disease and risk for cognitive impairment or dementia. METHODS Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were searched for all publications until 8th January 2016. Articles were included if they fulfilled the inclusion criteria: (1) myocardial infarction, angina pectoris or coronary heart disease (combination of both) as predictor variable; (2) cognition, cognitive impairment or dementia as outcome; (3) population-based study; (4) prospective (≥1 year follow-up), cross-sectional or case-control study design; (5) ≥100 participants; and (6) aged ≥45 years. Reference lists of publications and secondary literature were hand-searched for possible missing articles. Two reviewers independently screened all abstracts and extracted information from potential relevant full-text articles using a standardized data collection form. Study quality was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We pooled estimates from the most fully adjusted model using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS We identified 6,132 abstracts, of which 24 studies were included. A meta-analysis of 10 prospective cohort studies showed that coronary heart disease was associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment or dementia (OR = 1.45, 95%CI = 1.21-1.74, p<0.001). Between-study heterogeneity was low (I2 = 25.7%, 95%CI = 0-64, p = 0.207). Similar significant associations were found in separate meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies for the individual predictors (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris). In contrast, meta-analyses of cross-sectional and case-control studies were inconclusive. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION This meta-analysis suggests that coronary heart disease is prospectively associated with increased odds of developing cognitive impairment or dementia. Given the projected worldwide increase in the number of people affected by coronary heart disease and dementia, insight into causal mechanisms or common pathways underlying the heart-brain connection is needed.},

abstract = {AIMS Heart failure (HF) is associated with tissue hypoperfusion and congestion leading to organ dysfunction. Although cerebral blood flow (CBF) is preserved over a wide range of perfusion pressures in healthy subjects, it is impaired in end-stage HF. We aimed to compare CBF, autoregulation, and cognitive function in patients with mild non-ischaemic HF with healthy controls. METHODS AND RESULTS Fifteen patients with mild idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and 15 matched healthy controls were studied. Co-existing cerebrovascular disease was excluded. All subjects, except five patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, underwent magnetic resonance imaging for measurements of both CBF by arterial spin labelling and quantitative volume flow entering the brain. Cardiocerebral vascular function was assessed with Doppler techniques testing cerebral dynamic autoregulation and vasomotor reactivity. Cognitive analysis was performed by neuropsychological testing. Global and regional CBF did not differ between HF patients (44.3 mL/100 g.min) and controls (42.1 mL/100 g.min). Basilar but not carotid artery inflow was reduced in patients (1.95 mL/s vs. 2.51 mL/s, P = 0.009). Testing autoregulation revealed fewer dampened blood flow fluctuations in HF patients vs. controls (0.96% vs. 0.67%, P < 0.001). Vasomotor reactivity in HF patients showed a reduced CBF velocity (48.4% vs. 61.0%, P = 0.05) and regional cerebral oxygen saturation (18.3% vs. 23.8%, P = 0.02). Cognitive function overall was not affected. CONCLUSION Although global CBF was unaffected in patients with mild HF, significant changes in basilar inflow volume, cerebral autoregulation and vasomotor reactivity were observed. We describe a model of dynamic cerebral mechanisms required to compensate for the impaired haemodynamics in early-stage HF.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Low heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of cardiac autonomic dysfunction, has been associated with major risk factors of cognitive impairment. Yet, the direct association of HRV with cognitive function remains relatively unexplored, particularly in midlife. METHODS In 2005, 2 measures of short-term HRV, the SD of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), were calculated for participants of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study, and then categorized into quartiles. Five years later, 3 cognitive tests were administered for verbal memory ("Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test", RAVLT, range 0-15), processing speed ("Digit Symbol Substitution Test", DSST, range 0-133), and executive function ("Stroop interference"). RESULTS Two thousand one hundred and eighteen participants (57.7% female, 42.2% Black) with a mean baseline age of 45.3 years were included in this analysis. In demographic-adjusted models, compared to participants with quartile 1 SDNN (lowest quartile), participants in the upper quartiles of SDNN scored better on the DSST (quartile 4: $\beta$ = 1.83 points better, P = 0.03; and quartile 3: $\beta$ = 1.95 points better, P = 0.03) and on the stroop (quartile 3: $\beta$ = 1.19 points better, P < 0.05; and quartile2: $\beta$ = 1.44 points better, P = 0.02). After adjusting for behavioral and cardiovascular risk factors, higher quartile SDNN remained significantly associated with better stroop score (quartile 3: $\beta$ = 1.21 points better, P = 0.04; and quartile 2: $\beta$ = 1.72 points better, P < 0.01) but not with DSST. There was no association between quartile of RMSSD and cognitive function, from fully adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that higher quartile SDDN is associated with better executive function in midlife, above, and beyond cardiovascular risk factors.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Sympathovagal imbalance (SVI) has been reported to be associated with metabolic derangements in type 2 diabetes. We investigated the association of SVI with cognitive impairment in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS Patients with a new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (n=43) and age-matched healthy control subjects (n=43) were recruited for the study. Body mass index and blood pressure measurements were recorded. SVI was assessed by spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV), and cognitive function was assessed by recording the positive wave that appears in 300 milliseconds from application of stimulus in event-related potential tracing (P300). Insulin resistance was determined by the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) formula using blood glucose and insulin data, and oxidative stress was assessed by estimation of malondialdehyde. Association of various factors with cognitive impairment was evaluated by Pearson correlation analysis, and independent contributions of these factors to cognitive impairment were assessed by multiple regression analysis. RESULTS P300 latency was significantly prolonged in the diabetes group compared with the control group. Ratio of low-frequency to high-frequency power (LF-HF ratio) of HRV, the marker of SVI was found to be significantly correlated and linked with P300. Malondialdehyde and HOMA-IR were correlated with LF-HF ratio. CONCLUSION Treatment-na{\"{i}}ve patients with type 2 diabetes have SVI and considerable cognitive impairment. Insulin resistance and oxidative stress contribute to cognitive impairment, and SVI could be the physiologic link to cognitive impairment in treatment-na{\"{i}}ve patients with type 2 diabetes.},
