@article{Cunha2016,
abstract = {Summary Since first identified in early 1977, bacteria of the genus Legionella are recognised as a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia and a rare cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia. Legionella bacteria multisystem manifestations mainly affect susceptible patients as a result of age, underlying debilitating conditions, or immunosuppression. Water is the major natural reservoir for Legionella, and the pathogen is found in many different natural and artificial aquatic environments such as cooling towers or water systems in buildings, including hospitals. The term given to the severe pneumonia and systemic infection caused by Legionella bacteria is Legionnaires' disease. Over time, the prevalence of legionellosis or Legionnaires' disease has risen, which might indicate a greater awareness and reporting of the disease. Advances in microbiology have led to a better understanding of the ecological niches and pathogenesis of the condition. Legionnaires' disease is not always suspected because of its non-specific symptoms, and the diagnostic tests routinely available do not offer the desired sensitivity. However, effective antibiotics are available. Disease notification systems provide the basis for initiating investigations and limiting the scale and recurrence of outbreaks. This report reviews our current understanding of this disease.},

@article{Sager2017,
abstract = {Several controlled clinical studies have evaluated the potential of the infection biomarker procalcitonin (PCT) to improve the diagnostic work-up of patients with bacterial infections and its influence on decisions regarding antibiotic therapy. Most research has focused on lower respiratory tract infections and critically ill sepsis patients. A clinical utility for PCT has also been found for patients with urinary tract infections, postoperative infections, meningitis, and patients with acute heart failure with possible superinfection (i.e., pneumonia). In these indications, PCT levels measured on hospital admission were found to substantially reduce the initiation of antibiotic treatment in low-risk situations (i.e., bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation). For more severe infections (i.e., pneumonia, sepsis), antibiotic stewardship by monitoring of PCT kinetics resulted in shorter antibiotic treatment durations with early cessation of therapy. Importantly, these strategies appear to be safe without increasing the risk for mortality, recurrent infections, or treatment failures. PCT kinetics also proved to have prognostic value correlating with disease severity (i.e., pancreatitis, abdominal infection) and resolution of illness (i.e., sepsis). Although promising findings have been published in these different types of infections, there are a number of limitations regarding PCT, including suboptimal sensitivity and/or specificity, which makes a careful interpretation of PCT in the clinical context mandatory. This narrative review aims to update clinicians on the strengths and limitations of PCT for patient management, focusing on research conducted within the last 4 years.},

@article{Thwaites2017a,
abstract = {F ever in the returning traveler is a common clinical scenario that often leads to hospitalization and may be the only symptom of a serious or life-threatening illness. 1 Three percent of 784 Americans who traveled abroad for short periods reported an episode of febrile illness, 2 and fever was the chief symptom in 28% of 24,920 ill travelers who presented to travel clinics on their return home. 3 The absolute number of travelers is large and rising, with the International Tourism Organization reporting 1.2 billion trips in 2015, an increase of 4.4% from the previous year. 4 The challenge presented by returning travelers with febrile illnesses is changing for two reasons. First, increasing numbers of travelers are older than 60 years of age or are seeking health care elsewhere (" medical tour-ists "), and these travelers are more likely than others to have clinically significant coexisting conditions and consequently increased morbidity from infections. Sec-ond, the likelihood of multidrug resistance in the infecting organisms is increas-ing. 5-7 The recent Ebola epidemic in West Africa, the emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the reemergence of Zika and chikungunya viruses have highlighted the importance of being alert to the possi-bility that an emerging pathogen is causing a febrile episode. Fever in the returning traveler is an evolving clinical challenge, with respect to both the infections responsible for the fever and the sources and quality of informa-tion available to assist the physician. We review available sources of global informa-tion on outbreaks and the epidemiologic features of infectious diseases and offer a practical approach to emerging or transmissible infectious diseases that may pose a life-threatening risk to patients, as well as clinicians and laboratory workers.
