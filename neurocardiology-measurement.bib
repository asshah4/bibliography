abstract = {Abstract Variability metrics hold promise as potential indicators for autonomic function, prediction of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, psychophysiological status, and general wellness. Although the investigation of heart rate variability (HRV) has been prevalent for several decades, the methods used for preprocessing, windowing, and choosing appropriate parameters lacks consensus among academic and clinical investigators. Moreover, many of the important steps are omitted from publications, preventing reproducibility. To address this, we have compiled a comprehensive and open-source modular toolbox for calculating HRV metrics and other related variability indices, on both raw cardiovascular time series, and RR intervals. The software, known as the PhysioNet Cardiovascular Signal Toolbox, is implemented in the MATLAB programming language, with standard (open) input and output formats, and requires no external libraries. The functioning of our software is compared with other widely used and referenced HRV toolboxes to identify important differences. Our findings demonstrate how modest differences in the approach to HRV analysis can lead to divergent results, a factor that might have contributed to the lack of repeatability of studies and clinical applicability of HRV metrics. Existing HRV toolboxes do not include standardized preprocessing, signal quality indices (for noisy segment removal), and abnormal rhythm detection and are therefore likely to lead to significant errors in the presence of moderate to high noise or arrhythmias. We therefore describe the inclusion of validated tools to address these issues. We also make recommendations for default values and testing/reporting.},

abstract = {A high degree of heart rate (HR) variability is found in compensated hearts with good function, whereas HR variability can be decreased with severe coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, aging and diabetic neuropathy. To test the hypothesis that HR variability is a predictor of long-term survival after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the Holter tapes of 808 patients who survived AMI were analyzed. Heart rate variability was defined as the standard deviation of all normal RR intervals in a 24-hour continuous electrocardiogram recording made 11 ± 3 days after AMI. In all patients demographic, clinical and laboratory variables were measured at baseline. Mean follow-up time was 31 months. Of all Holter variables measured, HR variability had the strongest univariate correlation with mortality. The relative risk of mortality was 5.3 times higher in the group with HR variability of less than 50 ms than the group with HR variability of more than 100 ms. HR variability remained a significant predictor of mortality after adjusting for clinical, demographic, other Holter features and ejection fraction. A hypothesis to explain this finding is that decreased HR variability correlates with increased sympathetic or decreased vagal tone, which may predispose to ventricular fibrillation. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {The prevalence of coronary artery stenoses ≥ 70{\%} or left main stenosis ≥ 50{\%} was evaluated in 20,391 patients who underwent angiography in the Coronary Artery Surgery Study from 1975-1979. After the patients with unstable angina or myocardial infarction were excluded, the disease prevalence in the 8157 patients with definite angina, probable angina, and nonspecific chest pain was 93{\%}, 66{\%} and 14{\%} in men and 72{\%}, 36{\%} and 6{\%} in women (p {\textless} 0.001). The age and sex of the patients and character of chest pain were important determinants of disease prevalence and severity. Left main or three-vessel coronary disease occurred in more than 50{\%} of middle-aged men and older women with definite angina and in more than 50{\%} of men who had probable angina and were older than 60 yrs of age. In contrast, left main coronary disease occurred in less than 2{\%} of 1282 men and less than 1{\%} of 1397 women with nonspecific chest pain regardless of age. In this latter patient subset, less than 5{\%} of men and less than 1{\%} of women in each decade under 60 yrs had left main or three-vessel coronary artery disease. Thus, high-risk coronary disease is common in middle-aged patients with definite angina and older patients with probable angina, but is rare in patients with nonspecific chest pain. Indications and guidelines for diagnostic noninvasive tests and coronary angiography could be based on these results.},

abstract = {We studied the neural determinants of the second (i.e., high frequency, HF)- and third-order (i.e., low frequency, LF) spontaneous oscillations of heart period (R-R interval) and arterial pressure (AP) in conscious dogs, with the hypothesis that they might furnish quantitative markers of autonomic controlling activities. Spectral analysis of simultaneous R-R and AP variabilities quantified these oscillations that were also evaluated in units normalized by total power to focus on the balance of these two major components. At rest we observed a prevalent HF component (approximately 0.25 Hz) in R-R and AP variabilities that was synchronous with respiration. This HF component of R-R variability disappeared after atropine infusion and can be considered a marker mostly of vagal activity. When baroreceptor unloading, obtained by moderate hypotension, increased sympathetic activity the LF component increased in R-R, systolic, and diastolic AP variabilities. This increase in LF was not present after ganglionic blockade or after chronic arterial baroreceptor denervation. After chronic bilateral stellectomy, hypotension was not accompanied by an increase in LF component of R-R variability, while LF component remained in AP variability. An increase in LF component of R-R and AP variabilities was observed during transient coronary artery occlusion.},

abstract = {Background: Electroanatomic mapping systems are used to support electrophysiology research. Data exported from these systems is stored in proprietary formats which are challenging to access and storage-space inefficient. No previous work has made available an open-source platform for parsing and interrogating this data in a standardized format. We therefore sought to develop a standardized, open-source data structure and associated computer code to store electroanatomic mapping data in a space-efficient and easily accessible manner. Methods: A data structure was defined capturing the available anatomic and electrical data. OpenEP, implemented in MATLAB, was developed to parse and interrogate this data. Functions are provided for analysis of chamber geometry, activation mapping, conduction velocity mapping, voltage mapping, ablation sites, and electrograms as well as visualization and input/output functions. Performance benchmarking for data import and storage was performed. Data import and analysis validation was performed for chamber geometry, activation mapping, voltage mapping and ablation representation. Finally, systematic analysis of electrophysiology literature was performed to determine the suitability of OpenEP for contemporary electrophysiology research. Results: The average time to parse clinical datasets was 400 ± 162 s per patient. OpenEP data was two orders of magnitude smaller than compressed clinical data (OpenEP: 20.5 ± 8.7 Mb, vs clinical: 1.46 ± 0.77 Gb). OpenEP-derived geometry metrics were correlated with the same clinical metrics (Area: R2 = 0.7726, P {\textless} 0.0001; Volume: R2 = 0.5179, P {\textless} 0.0001). Investigating the cause of systematic bias in these correlations revealed OpenEP to outperform the clinical platform in recovering accurate values. Both activation and voltage mapping data created with OpenEP were correlated with clinical values (mean voltage R2 = 0.8708, P {\textless} 0.001; local activation time R2 = 0.8892, P {\textless} 0.0001). OpenEP provides the processing necessary for 87 of 92 qualitatively assessed analysis techniques (95{\%}) and 119 of 136 quantitatively assessed analysis techniques (88{\%}) in a contemporary cohort of mapping studies. Conclusions: We present the OpenEP framework for evaluating electroanatomic mapping data. OpenEP provides the core functionality necessary to conduct electroanatomic mapping research. We demonstrate that OpenEP is both space-efficient and accurately representative of the original data. We show that OpenEP captures the majority of data required for contemporary electroanatomic mapping-based electrophysiology research and propose a roadmap for future development.},

abstract = {The Coronary Artery Surgery Study, CASS, enrolled 24,959 patients between August 1975 and June 1979 who were studied angiographically for suspected coronary artery disease. This paper compares the prognostic value for survival without early elective surgery of eight different indices of the extent of coronary artery disease: the number of diseased vessels, two indices using the number of proximal arterial segments diseased, two empirically generated indices from the CASS data, and the published indices of Friesinger, Gensini, and the National Heart and Chest Hospital, London. All had considerable prognostic information. Typically 80{\%} of the prognostic information in one index was also contained in another. Our analysis shows that good prediction from angiographic data results from a combination of left ventricular function and arteriographic extent of disease. Prognosis may reasonably be obtained from three simple indices: the number of vessels diseased, the number of proximal arterial segments diseased, and a left ventricular wall motion score. These three indices account for an estimated 84{\%} of the prognostic information available. 6-yr survival varies between 93 and 16{\%} depending upon the values of these three indices.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sex and age have long been known to affect the ECG. Several biologic variables and anatomic factors may contribute to sex and age-related differences on the ECG. We hypothesized that a convolutional neural network (CNN) could be trained through a process called deep learning to predict a person's age and self-reported sex using only 12-lead ECG signals. We further hypothesized that discrepancies between CNN-predicted age and chronological age may serve as a physiological measure of health. METHODS: We trained CNNs using 10-second samples of 12-lead ECG signals from 499 727 patients to predict sex and age. The networks were tested on a separate cohort of 275 056 patients. Subsequently, 100 randomly selected patients with multiple ECGs over the course of decades were identified to assess within-individual accuracy of CNN age estimation. RESULTS: Of 275 056 patients tested, 52{\%} were males and mean age was 58.6±16.2 years. For sex classification, the model obtained 90.4{\%} classification accuracy with an area under the curve of 0.97 in the independent test data. Age was estimated as a continuous variable with an average error of 6.9±5.6 years (R-squared =0.7). Among 100 patients with multiple ECGs over the course of at least 2 decades of life, most patients (51{\%}) had an average error between real age and CNN-predicted age of {\textless}7 years. Major factors seen among patients with a CNN-predicted age that exceeded chronologic age by {\textgreater}7 years included: low ejection fraction, hypertension, and coronary disease (P{\textless}0.01). In the 27{\%} of patients where correlation was {\textgreater}0.8 between CNN-predicted and chronologic age, no incident events occurred over follow-up (33±12 years). CONCLUSIONS: Applying artificial intelligence to the ECG allows prediction of patient sex and estimation of age. The ability of an artificial intelligence algorithm to determine physiological age, with further validation, may serve as a measure of overall health.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV), the changes in the beat-to-beat heart rate calculated from the electrocar- diogram (ECG), is a key indicator of an individual's cardiovascular condition. Assessment of HRV has been shown to aid clinical diagnosis and intervention strategies. However, the variety of HRV estima- tion methods and contradictory reports in this field indicate that there is a need for a more rigorous investigation of these methods as aids to clinical evaluation. This thesis investigates the development of appropriate HRV signal processing techniques in the context of pilot studies in two fields of potential application, sleep and head-up tilting (HUT). A novel method for characterising normality in the ECG using both timing information and morpho- logical characteristics is presented. A neural network, used to learn the beat-to-beat variations in ECG waveform morphology, is shown to provide a highly sensitive technique for identifying normal beats. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based frequency-domain HRV techniques, which require re-sampling of the inherently unevenly sampled heart beat time-series (RR tachogram) to produce an evenly sampled time series, are then explored using a newmethod for producing an artificial RRtachogram. Re-sampling is shown to produce a significant error in the estimation of an (entirely specified) artificial RR tachogram. The Lomb periodogram, a method which requires no re-sampling and is applicable to the unevenly sampled nature of the signal is investigated. Experiments demonstrate that the Lomb periodogram is superior to the FFT for evaluating HRV measured by the ?? -ratio, a ratio of the low to high frequency ?? power in the RR tachogram within a specified band (0.04–0.4Hz). The effect of adding artificial ectopic beats in the RR tachogram is then considered and it is shown that ectopic beats significantly alter the spectrum and therefore must be removed or replaced. Replacing ectopic beats by phantom beats is compared to the case of ectopic-realted RR interval removal for the FFT and Lomb methods for varying levels of ectopy. The Lomb periodogram is shown to provide a significantly better estimate of the ?? - ?? ratio under these conditions and is a robust method for measuring the ?? -ratio in the presence of (a ?? possibly unknown number of) ectopic beats or artefacts. The Lomb periodogram and FFT-based techniques are applied to a database of sleep apn ? ic and normal subjects. A new method of assessing HRVduring sleep is proposed to minimise the confounding effects on HRV of changes due to changing mental activity. Estimation of ?? -ratio using the Lomb ?? technique is shown to separate these two patient groups more effectively than with FFT-based techniques. Results are also presented for the application of these methods to controlled (HUT) studies on subjects with syncope, an autonomic nervous system problem, which indicate that the techniques developed in this thesis may provide a method for differentiating between sub-classes of syncope},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) is a known risk factor for mortality in both healthy and patient populations. There are currently no normative data for short-term measures of HRV. A thorough review of short-term HRV data published since 1996 was therefore performed. Data from studies published after the 1996 Task Force report (i.e., between January 1997 and September 2008) and reporting short-term measures of HRV obtained in normally healthy individuals were collated and factors underlying discrepant values were identified. Forty-four studies met the pre-set inclusion criteria involving 21,438 participants. Values for short-term HRV measures from the literature were lower than Task Force norms. A degree of homogeneity for common measures of HRV in healthy adults was shown across studies. A number of studies demonstrate large interindividual variations (up to 260,000{\%}), particularly for spectral measures. A number of methodological discrepancies underlined disparate values. These include a systematic failure within the literature (a) to recognize the importance of RR data recognition/editing procedures and (b) to question disparate HRV values observed in normally healthy individuals. A need for large-scale population studies and a review of the Task Force recommendations for short-term HRV that covers the full-age spectrum were identified. Data presented should be used to quantify reference ranges for short-term measures of HRV in healthy adult populations but should be undertaken with reference to methodological factors underlying disparate values. Recommendations for the measurement of HRV require updating to include current technologies. {\textcopyright} 2010, The Authors. Journal compilation.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) is concerned with the analysis of the intervals between heartbeats. An emerging analysis technique is the Poincar{\'{e}} plot, which takes a sequence of intervals and plots each interval against the following interval. The geometry of this plot has been shown to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy subjects in clinical settings. The Poincar{\'{e}} plot is a valuable HRV analysis technique due to its ability to display nonlinear aspects of the interval sequence. The problem is, how do we quantitatively characterize the plot to capture useful summary descriptors that are independent of existing HRV measures? Researchers have investigated a number of techniques: converting the two-dimensional plot into various one-dimensional views; the fitting of an ellipse to the plot shape; and measuring the correlation coefficient of the plot. We investigate each of these methods in detail and show that they are all measuring linear aspects of the intervals which existing HRV indexes already specify. The fact that these methods appear insensitive to the nonlinear characteristics of the intervals is an important finding because the Poincar{\'{e}} plot is primarily a nonlinear technique. Therefore, further work is needed to determine if better methods of characterizing Poincar{\'{e}} plot geometry can be found.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Electrocardiography (ECG) may detect subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) in asymptomatic individuals, but its role in assessing adverse events beyond traditional risk factors is not clear. Interval and vector data that are commonly available on modern ECGs may offer independent prognostic information that improves risk classification. OBJECTIVES: To derive and validate a CVD risk equation based on ECG metrics and to determine its incremental benefit in addition to the Framingham risk score (FRS). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study included 3640 randomly selected community-based adults aged 40 to 74 years without known CVD from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) cohort (1971-1975) and 6329 from the NHANES III cohort (1988-1994). Participants were sampled from across the United States. A risk score to assess incident nonfatal and fatal CVD events was derived based on computer-generated ECG data, including frontal P, R, and T axes; heart rate; and PR, QRS, and QT intervals from NHANES I. The most prognostic variables, along with age and sex, were incorporated into the NHANES ECG risk equation. The equation was evaluated in the NHANES III cohort for an independent validation. Follow-up in the NHANES III cohort was completed on December 31, 2006. Data for this study were analyzed from August 11, 2015, to May 20, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was CVD death. Secondary outcomes included 10-year ischemic heart disease and all-cause death. RESULTS: The final study sample included 9969 participants (4714 men [47.3{\%}]; 5255 women [52.7{\%}]; mean [SD] age, 55.3 [10.1] years) from both cohorts. Frontal T axis, heart rate, and heart rate–corrected QT interval were the most significant ECG factors in the NHANES I cohort. In the validation cohort (NHANES III), the equation provided for prognostic information for fatal CVD with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.23 (95{\%} CI, 2.82-3.72); the C statistic was 0.79 (95{\%} CI, 0.76-0.81). When added to the FRS in Cox proportional hazards regression models, the categorical (1{\%}, 5{\%}, and 10{\%} cutoffs) net reclassification improvement was 24{\%}. When the FRS and ECG scores were combined in a single model, the C statistic improved by 0.04 (95{\%} CI, 0.02-0.06) to 0.80 (95{\%} CI, 0.77-0.82). Similar improvements were noted when the ECG score was added to the pooled cohort equation. When the equation for prognostic information about ischemic heart disease and all-cause death was evaluated, the results were similar. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: An ECG risk score based on age, sex, heart rate, frontal T axis, and QT interval assesses the risk for CVD and compares favorably with the FRS alone in an independent cohort of asymptomatic individuals. Although the ECG risk equation is low cost, further research is needed to ascertain whether this additional step in risk stratification may improve prevention efforts and reduce CVD events.},

abstract = {Background The autonomic response to acute emotional stress can be highly variable, and pathological responses are associated with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. We evaluated the autonomic response to stress reactivity of young healthy subjects and aging subjects with coronary artery disease to understand how the autonomic stress response differs with aging. Methods Physiologic reactivity to arithmetic stress in a cohort of 25 young, healthy subjects ({\textless} 30 years) and another cohort of 25 older subjects ({\textgreater} 55 years) with CAD was evaluated using electrocardiography, impedance cardiography, and arterial pressure recordings. Stress-related changes in the pre-ejection period (PEP), which measures sympathetic activity, and high frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV), which measures parasympathetic activity, were analyzed as primary outcomes. Results Mental stress reduced PEP in both groups (p{\textless}0.01), although the decrease was 50{\%} greater in the healthy group. Mean HF HRV decreased significantly in the aging group only (p = 0.01). Discussion PEP decreases with stress regardless of health and age status, implying increased sympathetic function. Its decline with stress may be attenuated in CAD. The HF HRV (parasympathetic) stress reactivity is more variable and attenuated in younger individuals; perhaps this is related to a protective parasympathetic reflex.

@article{Sassi2015,
abstract = {Following the publication of the Task Force document on heart rate variability (HRV) in 1996, a number of articles have been published to describe new HRV methodologies and their application in different physiological and clinical studies. This document presents a critical review of the new methods. A particular attention has been paid to methodologies that have not been reported in the 1996 standardization document but have been more recently tested in sufficiently sized populations. The following methods were considered: Long-range correlation and fractal analysis; Short-term complexity; Entropy and regularity; and Nonlinear dynamical systems and chaotic behaviour. For each of these methods, technical aspects, clinical achievements, and suggestions for clinical application were reviewed. While the novel approaches have contributed in the technical understanding of the signal character of HRV, their success in developing new clinical tools, such as those for the identification of high-risk patients, has been rather limited. Available results obtained in selected populations of patients by specialized laboratories are nevertheless of interest but new prospective studies are needed. The investigation of new parameters, descriptive of the complex regulation mechanisms of heart rate, has to be encouraged because not all information in the HRV signal is captured by traditional methods. The new technologies thus could provide after proper validation, additional physiological, and clinical meaning. Multidisciplinary dialogue and specialized courses in the combination of clinical cardiology and complex signal processing methods seem warranted for further advances in studies of cardiac oscillations and in the understanding normal and abnormal cardiac control processes.},

@article{Houle1999,
abstract = {The low-frequency component of the heart rate variability spectrum (0.06-0.10 Hz) is often used as an accurate reflection of sympathetic activity. Therefore, interventions that enhance cardiac sympathetic drive, e.g., exercise and myocardial ischemia, should elicit increases in the low-frequency power. Furthermore, because an enhanced sympathetic activation has been linked to an increased propensity for malignant arrhythmias, one might also predict a greater low-frequency power in animals that are susceptible to ventricular fibrillation than in resistant animals. To test these hypotheses, a 2-min coronary occlusion was made during the last minute of exercise in 71 dogs with healed myocardial infarctions: 43 had ventricular fibrillation (susceptible) and 28 did not experience arrhythmias (resistant). Exercise or ischemia alone provoked significant heart rate increases in both groups of animals, with the largest increase in the susceptible animals. These heart rate increases were attenuated by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Despite the sympathetically mediated increases in heart rate, the low-frequency power decreased, rather than increased, in both groups, with the largest decrease again in the susceptible animals: 4.0 +/- 0.2 (susceptible) vs. 4.1 +/- 0.2 ln ms2 (resistant) in preexercise control and 2.2 +/- 0.2 (susceptible) vs. 2.9 +/- 0.2 ln ms2 (resistant) at highest exercise level. In a similar manner the parasympathetic antagonist atropine sulfate elicited significant reductions in the low-frequency power. Although sympathetic nerve activity was not directly recorded, these data suggest that the low-frequency component of the heart rate power spectrum probably results from an interaction of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems and, as such, does not accurately reflect changes in the sympathetic activity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ECG remains the most widely used diagnostic test for characterization of cardiac structure and electrical activity. We hypothesized that parallel advances in computing power, machine learning algorithms, and availability of large-scale data could substantially expand the clinical inferences derived from the ECG while at the same time preserving interpretability for medical decision-making. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified 36 186 ECGs from the University of California, San Francisco database that would enable training of models for estimation of cardiac structure or function or detection of disease. We segmented the ECG into standard component waveforms and intervals using a novel combination of convolutional neural networks and hidden Markov models and evaluated this segmentation by comparing resulting electrical intervals against 141 864 measurements produced during the clinical workflow. We then built a patient-level ECG profile, a 725-element feature vector and used this profile to train and interpret machine learning models for examples of cardiac structure (left ventricular mass, left atrial volume, and mitral annulus e-prime) and disease (pulmonary arterial hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloid, and mitral valve prolapse). ECG measurements derived from the convolutional neural network-hidden Markov model segmentation agreed with clinical estimates, with median absolute deviations as a fraction of observed value of 0.6{\%} for heart rate and 4{\%} for QT interval. Models trained using patient-level ECG profiles enabled surprising quantitative estimates of left ventricular mass and mitral annulus e' velocity (median absolute deviation of 16{\%} and 19{\%}, respectively) with good discrimination for left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction as binary traits. Model performance using our approach for disease detection demonstrated areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.94 for pulmonary arterial hypertension, 0.91 for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 0.86 for cardiac amyloid, and 0.77 for mitral valve prolapse. CONCLUSIONS: Modern machine learning methods can extend the 12-lead ECG to quantitative applications well beyond its current uses while preserving the transparency that is so fundamental to clinical care.},

abstract = {Introduction: Cardiac involvement is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in primary light chain (AL) amyloidosis. The electrocardiographic spatial QRS-T angle reflects changes in the direction of the repolarization sequence and is a powerful predictor of outcome in patients with heart failure. We examined the significance of the frontal QRS-T angle in predicting the clinical outcome in patients with AL cardiac amyloidosis. Methods: Forty-three consecutive patients with cardiac involvement of AL amyloidosis were studied. Patients were followed for survival. Results: Patient median age was 62 years, 56{\%} were males. After a median follow up of 56 months, 16 out of 43 patients had died (37{\%}). The median QRS-T angle was 102° (interquartile range 35–148). QRS-T angle{\textgreater}102° was associated with increased prevalence of lambda free light chain disease and the presence of a pleural effusion. It was also associated with increased interventricular septum thickness, smaller left ventricle end-diastolic diameter, echocardiographic myocardial sparkling texture, pericardial effusion, elevated NT-Pro-BNP and increased restrictive physiology evident by increased E/A and E/e`. A QRS-T angle{\textgreater}102° was a significant predictor of increased mortality by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (71.6 ± 11.1{\%} vs. 45.7 ± 11.1{\%}, P = .02). A QRS-T angle{\textgreater}102° was an independent predictor of mortality by Cox regression analysis (HR 3.00, 95{\%} CI 1.01–8.89, P {\textless} .05). Conclusions: The QRS-T angle is associated with indices of advanced amyloid disease and is an independent predictor of survival.},

abstract = {Background - Asymptomatic individuals account for the majority of sudden cardiac deaths (SCDs). Development of effective, low-cost, and noninvasive SCD risk stratification tools is necessary. Methods and Results - Participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study and Cardiovascular Health Study (n=20 177; age, 59.3±10.1 years; age range, 44-100 years; 56{\%} female; 77{\%} white) were followed up for 14.0 years (median). Five ECG markers of global electric heterogeneity (GEH; sum absolute QRST integral, spatial QRST angle, spatial ventricular gradient [SVG] magnitude, SVG elevation, and SVG azimuth) were measured on standard 12-lead ECGs. Cox proportional hazards and competing risks models evaluated associations between GEH electrocardiographic parameters and SCD. An SCD competing risks score was derived from demographics, comorbidities, and GEH parameters. SCD incidence was 1.86 per 1000 person-years. After multivariable adjustment, baseline GEH parameters and large increases in GEH parameters over time were independently associated with SCD. Final SCD risk scores included age, sex, race, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, and GEH parameters as continuous variables. When GEH parameters were added to clinical/demographic factors, the C statistic increased from 0.777 to 0.790 (P=0.008), the risk score classified 10-year SCD risk as high ({\textgreater}5{\%}) in 7.2{\%} of participants, 10{\%} of SCD victims were appropriately reclassified into a high-risk category, and only 1.4{\%} of SCD victims were inappropriately reclassified from high to intermediate risk. The net reclassification index was 18.3{\%}. Conclusions - Abnormal electrophysiological substrate quantified by GEH parameters is independently associated with SCD in the general population. The addition of GEH parameters to clinical characteristics improves SCD risk prediction.},

Three 10-second and 2 six-minute heart rate recordings were obtained during each of 2 visits, separated by 1 to 2 weeks. We partitioned the measurement error into components and computed intraclass correlation coefficients using nested, random effects models. Repeatability improved with the length of recording: intraclass correlation coefficients were greater than 0.7 for 6-minute measures and 2-minute time domain measures and greater than 0.5 for 2-minute frequency domain measures. Repeatability of measures from 10-second records was lower, but improved considerably when the mean from 2 or 3 records was used. Correlations between the same measures from different length recordings were quite high. Our findings support the use of records of at least 5 minutes in length in epidemiological studies, in accordance with previous guidelines. Researchers using 10-second records should consider taking the mean of several recordings, when possible, or using statistical methods to correct for measurement error.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND We studied 715 patients 2 weeks after myocardial infarction to establish the associations between six frequency domain measures of heart period variability (HPV) and mortality during 4 years of follow-up. METHODS AND RESULTS Each measure of HPV had a significant and at least moderately strong univariate association with all-cause mortality, cardiac death, and arrhythmic death. Power in the lower-frequency bands--ultra low frequency (ULF) and very low frequency (VLF) power--had stronger associations with all three mortality end points than power in the higher-frequency bands--low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) power. The 24-hour total power also had a significant and strong association with all three mortality end points. VLF power was the only variable that was more strongly associated with arrhythmic death than with cardiac death or all-cause mortality. In multivariate Cox regression models using a step-up approach to evaluate the independent associations between frequency domain measures of heart period variability and death of all causes, ULF power was selected first (i.e., was the single component with the strongest association). Adding VLF or LF power to the Cox regression model significantly improved the prediction of outcome. With both ULF and VLF power in the Cox regression model, the addition of the other two components, LF and HF power, singly or together, did not significantly improve the prediction of all-cause mortality. We explored the relation between the heart period variability measures and all-cause mortality, cardiac death, and arrhythmic death before and after adjusting for five previously established postinfarction risk predictors: age, New York Heart Association functional class, rales in the coronary care unit, left ventricular ejection fraction, and ventricular arrhythmias detected in a 24-hour Holter ECG recording. CONCLUSIONS After adjustment for the five risk predictors, the association between mortality and total, ULF, and VLF power remained significant and strong, whereas LF and HF power were only moderately strongly associated with mortality. The tendency for VLF power to be more strongly associated with arrhythmic death than with all-cause or cardiac death was still evident after adjusting for the five covariates. Adding measures of HPV to previously known predictors of risk after myocardial infarction identifies small subgroups with a 2.5-year mortality risk of approximately 50{\%}.},

abstract = {Diminished heart rate variability is associated with high sympathetic tone and an increased mortality rate in heart failure cases. We constructed Poincar{\'{e}} plots of each sinus R-R interval plotted against the subsequent R-R interval from 24-hour Holter recordings of 24 healthy subjects (control group) and 24 patients with heart failure. Every subject in the control group had a comet-shaped Poincar{\'{e}} plot resulting from an increase in beat-to-beat dispersion as heart rate slowed. No patient with heart failure had this comet-shaped pattern. Instead, three distinctive patterns were identified: (1) a torpedo-shaped pattern resulting from low R-R interval dispersion over the entire range of heart rates, (2) a fanshaped pattern resulting from restriction of overall R-R interval ranges with enhanced dispersion, and (3) complex patterns with clusters of points characteristic of stepwise changes in R-R intervals. Poincar{\'{e}} pattern could not be predicted from standard deviations of R-R intervals. This first use of Poincar{\'{e}} plots in heart rate variability analysis reveals a complexity not readily perceived from standard deviation information. Further study is warranted to determine if this method will allow refined assessment of cardiac-autonomic integrity in heart failure, which could help identify patients at highest risk for sudden death. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system has been implicated in the development of hypertension. Heart rate variability is a noninvasive tool to quantitatively estimate cardiac autonomic activity and has been used to document decreased cardiac autonomic activity in hypertension. The ability of decreased heart rate variability to predict incident hypertension has not been well studied, and there are no studies of whether hypertension leads to changes in heart rate variability. We investigated the temporal sequence linking hypertension, blood pressure, and heart rate variability in a population-based cohort of 11 061 individuals aged 45 to 54 years at baseline. Individuals with hypertension had decreased heart rate variability at baseline, and this association was present across the full blood pressure range. Among 7099 individuals without hypertension at baseline, low heart rate variability predicted greater risk of incident hypertension over 9 years of follow-up. The hazard ratio (95{\%} confidence interval {\{}[CI]){\}} for the lowest compared with the highest quartile of the standard deviation of normal-to-normal {\{}R-R{\}} intervals was 1.24 (95{\%} {\{}CI,{\}} 1.10–1.40), for the root mean square of successive differences in normal-to-normal {\{}R-R{\}} intervals was 1.36 (95{\%} {\{}CI,{\}} 1.21–1.54), and for {\{}R-R{\}} interval was 1.44 (95{\%} {\{}CI,{\}} 1.27–1.63). Over 9 years, there was no measurable difference in the rate of change in heart rate variability among those with and without hypertension, although the differences in heart rate variability at follow-up were smaller than those at baseline. These findings thus support the thesis that the autonomic nervous system is involved in the development of hypertension, yet suggest that differences in the autonomic profile of hypertensives and normotensives do not increase with time.},

abstract = {Background A reduction of complexity of heart beating interval variability that is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality in cardiovascular disease states is thought to derive from the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic neural impulses to the heart. However, rhythmic clocklike behavior intrinsic to pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node (SAN) drives their beating, even in the absence of autonomic neural input. Objective To test how this rhythmic clocklike behavior intrinsic to pacemaker cells interacts with autonomic impulses to the heart beating interval variability in vivo. Methods We analyzed beating interval variability in time and frequency domains and by fractal and entropy analyses: (1) in vivo, when the brain input to the SAN is intact; (2) during autonomic denervation in vivo; (3) in isolated SAN tissue (ie, in which the autonomic neural input is completely absent); (4) in single pacemaker cells isolated from the SAN; and (5) after autonomic receptor stimulation of these cells. Results Spontaneous beating intervals of pacemaker cells residing in the isolated SAN tissue exhibit fractal-like behavior and have lower approximate entropy compared with those in the intact heart. Isolation of pacemaker cells from SAN tissue, however, leads to a loss in the beating interval order and fractal-like behavior. $\beta$-Adrenergic receptor stimulation of isolated pacemaker cells increases intrinsic clock synchronization, decreases their action potential period, and increases system complexity. Conclusions Both the average beating interval in vivo and beating interval complexity are conferred by the combined effects of clock periodicity intrinsic to pacemaker cells and their response to autonomic neural input. {\textcopyright} 2014 Heart Rhythm Society.},

Females showed a significantly lower mean RR interval and standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN). The power spectral density of HRV in females is characterized by significantly less total power that contains significantly greater high- (HF) and less low-frequency (LF) power. This is further reflected by a lower LF/HF ratio. Meta-regression revealed significant effects of age, respiration control and the length of recording available for analysis. Although women showed greater mean heart rate, they showed greater vagal activity indexed by HF power of HRV. Underlying mechanisms of these findings are discussed.},

abstract = {The concept of the ventricular gradient was conceived in the mind of Frank Wilson in the early 1930s. Wilson, a mathematical genius, believed that the calculation of the ventricular gradient yielded information that was not otherwise obtainable. The method of analysis was not utilized by clinicians at large because the concept was not easy to understand and because the method used to compute the direction of the ventricular gradient was so time consuming that clinicians could not use it. Grant utilized the concept to create vector electrocardiography, but he believed that if his method of analysis was used, it was not often necessary to compute the direction of the ventricular gradient. He did, however, describe an easy way to compute the direction of the ventricular gradient. The current major clinical use of the ventricular gradient is to identify primary and secondary T-wave abnormalities in an electrocardiogram showing left or right ventricular hypertrophy or left or right ventricular conduction abnormalities. In addition, the author uses the term ventricular time gradient instead of ventricular gradient in an effort to clarify the concept. Finally, the author discusses the possible clinical significance of a normally directed, but shorter than normal, ventricular time gradient, an attribute that has not been emphasized previously.},

Visually analyzing this type of signal can be a tedious and subjective evaluation, whereas objective analysis through signal averaging is impossible. We propose a new automated technique to identify bursts through objective detection criteria, eliminating artifacts and preserving a beat-by-beat SNA signal for a variety of subsequent analyses. The technique was evaluated during both steady-state conditions (17 subjects) and dynamic changes with rapid vasoactive drug infusion (14 recordings from 5 subjects) on SNA signals of widely varied quality. Automated measures of SNA were highly correlated to visual measures of steady-state activity ( r = 0.903, P {\textless} 0.001), dynamic relation measures ( r= 0.987, P {\textless} 0.001), and measures of burst-by-burst variability ( r = 0.929, P {\textless} 0.001).

In the present study, detailed clinical assessments and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were performed prospectively on 100 patients undergoing elective coronary angiography. HR variability was inversely correlated with HR (r = -0.38, p = 0.0001), diabetes mellitus (r = -0.22, p = 0.025) and digoxin use (r = -0.29, p = 0.004), but not with left ventricular ejection fraction, extent of coronary artery disease or other clinical, electrocardiographic or angiographic variables. All patients were followed for 1 year. Major clinical events after initial discharge occurred in 10 patients and included 6 deaths and 4 coronary bypass operations. Left ventricular ejection fraction was the only variable that correlated with the occurrence of a clinical event (p = 0.002). Decreased HR variability and ejection fraction were the best predictors of mortality (both p {\textless} 0.01), and the contribution of HR variability to mortality was independent of ejection fraction, extent of coronary artery disease and other variables. Furthermore, 11 patients with HR variability {\textless}50 ms had an 18-fold increase in mortality compared with patients with HR variability {\textgreater}50 ms (36 vs 2{\%}, p = 0.001).

abstract = {Healthy biological systems exhibit complex patterns of variability that can be described by mathematical chaos. Heart rate variability (HRV) consists of changes in the time intervals between consecutive heartbeats called interbeat intervals (IBIs). A healthy heart is not a metronome. The oscillations of a healthy heart are complex and constantly changing, which allow the cardiovascular system to rapidly adjust to sudden physical and psychological challenges to homeostasis. This article briefly reviews current perspectives on the mechanisms that generate 24 h, short-term ({\~{}}5 min), and ultra-short-term ({\textless}5 min) HRV, the importance of HRV, and its implications for health and performance. The authors provide an overview of widely-used HRV time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear metrics. Time-domain indices quantify the amount of HRV observed during monitoring periods that may range from {\~{}}2 min to 24 h. Frequency-domain values calculate the absolute or relative amount of signal energy within component bands. Non-linear measurements quantify the unpredictability and complexity of a series of IBIs. The authors survey published normative values for clinical, healthy, and optimal performance populations. They stress the importance of measurement context, including recording period length, subject age, and sex, on baseline HRV values. They caution that 24 h, short-term, and ultra-short-term normative values are not interchangeable. They encourage professionals to supplement published norms with findings from their own specialized populations. Finally, the authors provide an overview of HRV assessment strategies for clinical and optimal performance interventions.},

In this paper, we address the data problem to select the sample rate and resolution that obtain the highest accuracy. For this purpose, we conduct experiments to find the impact of the sampling frequency and resolution on the quality of the QRS detection, by several open-source QRS detection algorithms with multiple variations of data representation.

abstract = {Metrics of heart period variability are widely used in the behavioral and biomedical sciences, although somewhat confusingly labeled as heart rate variability (HRV). Despite their wide use, HRV metrics are usually analyzed and interpreted without reference to prevailing levels of cardiac chronotropic state (i.e., mean heart rate or mean heart period). This isolated treatment of HRV metrics is nontrivial. All HRV metrics routinely used in the literature exhibit a known and positive relationship with the mean duration of the interval between two beats (heart period): as the heart period increases, so does its variability. This raises the question of whether HRV metrics should be “corrected” for the mean heart period (or its inverse, the heart rate). Here, we outline biological, quantitative, and interpretive issues engendered by this question. We provide arguments that HRV is neither uniformly nor simply a surrogate for heart period. We also identify knowledge gaps that remain to be satisfactorily addressed with respect to assumptions underlying existing HRV correction approaches. In doing so, we aim to stimulate further progress toward the rigorous use and disciplined interpretation of HRV. We close with provisional guidance on HRV reporting that acknowledges the complex interplay between the mean and variability of the heart period.},

abstract = {Objective: We proposed and tested a novel electrocardiogram marker of risk of ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). Methods: Digital orthogonal electrocardiograms were recorded at rest before implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation in 508 participants of a primary prevention ICDs prospective cohort study (mean ± SD age, 60 ± 12 years; 377 male [74{\%}]). The sum magnitude of the absolute QRST integral in 3 orthogonal leads (SAI QRST) was calculated. A derivation cohort of 128 patients was used to define a cutoff; a validation cohort (n = 380) was used to test a predictive value. Results: During a mean follow-up of 18 months, 58 patients received appropriate ICD therapies. The SAI QRST was lower in patients with VA (105.2 ± 60.1 vs 138.4 ± 85.7 mV - ms, P = .002). In the Cox proportional hazards analysis, patients with SAI QRST not exceeding 145 mV - ms had about 4-fold higher risk of VA (hazard ratio, 3.6; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.96-6.71; P {\textless} .0001) and a 6-fold higher risk of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (hazard ratio, 6.58; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.46-29.69; P = .014), whereas prediction of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation did not reach statistical significance.

Experimental evidence for an associ- ation between a propensity for lethal arrhythmias and signs of either increased sympathetic or reduced vagal activity has encouraged the development of quantitative markers of autonomic activity. Heart rate variability (HRV) represents one of the most promising such markers. The apparently easy derivation of this measure has popularized its use. As many commercial devices now provide automated measurement of HRV, the cardiologist has been pro- vided with a seemingly simple tool for both research and clinical studies[5]. However, the significance and meaning of the many different measures of HRV are more complex than generally appreciated and there is a potential for incorrect conclusions and for excessive or unfounded extrapolations. Recognition of these problems led the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We evaluated heart rate variability biofeedback as a method for increasing vagal baroreflex gain and improving pulmonary function among 54 healthy adults. METHODS: We compared 10 sessions of biofeedback training with an uninstructed control. Cognitive and physiological effects were measured in four of the sessions. RESULTS: We found acute increases in low-frequency and total spectrum heart rate variability, and in vagal baroreflex gain, correlated with slow breathing during biofeedback periods. Increased baseline baroreflex gain also occurred across sessions in the biofeedback group, independent of respiratory changes, and peak expiratory flow increased in this group, independently of cardiovascular changes. Biofeedback was accompanied by fewer adverse relaxation side effects than the control condition. CONCLUSIONS: Heart rate variability biofeedback had strong long-term influences on resting baroreflex gain and pulmonary function. It should be examined as a method for treating cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Also, this study demonstrates neuroplasticity of the baroreflex.},

It displays nonlinear characteristics of heart rate variability (HRV) from electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings and gives a global view of the long range of ECG signals. In the telemedicine or computer-aided diagnosis system, it would offer significant auxiliary information for diagnosis if the patterns of the Poincare plots can be automatically classified. Therefore, we developed an automatic classification system to distinguish five geometric patterns of the Poincare plots from four types of cardiac arrhythmias. The statistics features are designed on measurements and an ensemble classifier of three types of neural networks is proposed. Aiming at the difficulty to set a proper threshold for classifying the multiple categories, the threshold selection strategy is analyzed. 24 h ECG monitoring recordings from 674 patients, which have four types of cardiac arrhythmias, are adopted for recognition. For comparison, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers with linear and Gaussian kernels are also applied. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the extracted features and the better performance of the designed classifier. Our study can be applied to diagnose the corresponding sinus rhythm and arrhythmia substrates disease automatically in the telemedicine and computer-aided diagnosis system.},

GEH concept is based on the concept of the spatial ventricular gradient (SVG), which is a global measure of the dispersion of total recovery time. We quantify GEH by measuring five features of the SVG vector (SVG magnitude, direction (azimuth and elevation), a scalar value, and spatial QRS-T angle) on orthogonal XYZ ECG. In analysis of more than 20,000 adults we showed that GEH is independently associated with sudden cardiac death (SCD) after adjustment for demographics, cardiovascular disease (time-updated incident non-fatal cardiovascular events [coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, atrial fibrillation, use of beta-blockers], and known risk factors [cholesterol, triglycerides, physical activity index, smoking, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, antihypertensive medications, creatinine, alcohol intake, left ventricular ejection fraction, and time-updated ECG metrics (heart rate, QTc, QRS duration, ECG-left ventricular hypertrophy, bundle branch block or interventricular conduction delay)]. This finding suggests that GEH represents an independent electrophysiological substrate of SCD.},

abstract = {Aim: Our goal was to investigate the effect of a global XYZ median beat construction and the heart vector origin point definition on predictive accuracy of ECG biomarkers of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Methods: Atherosclerosis Risk In Community study participants with analyzable digital ECGs were included (n = 15,768; 55{\%} female, 73{\%} white, mean age 54.2 ± 5.8 y). We developed an algorithm to automatically detect the heart vector origin point on a median beat. Three different approaches to construct a global XYZ beat and two methods to locate origin point were compared. Global electrical heterogeneity was measured by sum absolute QRST integral (SAI QRST), spatial QRS-T angle, and spatial ventricular gradient (SVG) magnitude, azimuth, and elevation. Adjudicated SCD served as the primary outcome. Results: There was high intra-observer (kappa 0.972) and inter-observer (kappa 0.984) agreement in a heart vector origin definition between an automated algorithm and a human. QRS was wider in a median beat that was constructed using R-peak alignment than in time-coherent beat (88.1 ± 16.7 vs. 83.7 ± 15.9 ms; P {\textless} 0.0001), and on a median beat constructed using QRS-onset as a zeroed baseline, vs. isoelectric origin point (86.7 ± 15.9 vs. 83.7 ± 15.9 ms; P {\textless} 0.0001). ROC AUC was significantly larger for QRS, QT, peak QRS-T angle, SVG elevation, and SAI QRST if measured on a time-coherent median beat, and for SAI QRST and SVG magnitude if measured on a median beat using isoelectric origin point. Conclusion: Time-coherent global XYZ median beat with physiologically meaningful definition of the heart vector's origin point improved predictive accuracy of SCD biomarkers.},

abstract = {Background-Survival of post-myocardial infarction patients is related inversely to their levels of very-low-frequency (0.003 to 0.03 Hz) RR- interval variability. The physiological basis for such oscillations is unclear. In our study, we used blocking drugs to evaluate potential contributions of sympathetic and vagal mechanisms and the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system to very-low-frequency RR-interval variability in 10 young healthy subjects. Methods and Results-We recorded RR intervals and arterial pressures during three separate sessions, with the patient in supine and 40 degree upright tilt positions, during 20-minute frequency (0.25 Hz) and tidal volume-controlled breathing after intravenous injections: saline (control), atenolol (0.2 mg/kg, $\beta$-adrenergic blockade), atropine sulfate (0.04 mg/kg, parasympathetic blockade), atenolol and atropine (complete autonomic blockade), and enalaprilat (0.02 mg/kg, ACE blockade). We integrated fast Fourier transform RR-interval spectral power at very low (0.003 to 0.03 Hz), low (0.05 to 0.15 Hz), and respiratory (0.2 to 0.3 Hz) frequencies. $\beta$- Adrenergic blockade had no significant effect on very-low-or low-frequency RR-interval power but increased respiratory frequency power 2-fold. ACE blockade had no significant effect on low or respiratory frequency RR- interval power but modestly ({\~{}} 21.{\%}) increased very-low-frequency power in the supine (but not upright tilt) position (P{\textless}0.05). The most profound effects were exerted by parasympathetic blockade: Atropine, given alone or with atenolol, abolished nearly all RR-interval variability and decreased very-low-frequency variability by 92{\%}. Conclusions-Although very-low- frequency heart period rhythms are influenced by the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system, as low and respiratory frequency RR-interval rhythms, they depend primarily on the presence of parasympathetic outflow. Therefore the prognostic value of very-low-frequency heart period oscillations may derive from the fundamental importance of parasympathetic mechanisms in cardiovascular health.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Decreased heart rate variability (HRV) and abnormal nonlinear HRV shortly after myocardial infarction (MI) are risk factors for mortality. Traditional HRV predicts mortality in patients with a range of times post-MI, but the association of nonlinear HRV and outcome in this population is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: HRV was determined from 740 tapes recorded before antiarrhythmic therapy in Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial patients with ventricular premature contractions (VPCs) suppressed on the first randomized treatment. Patients were 70 +/- 121 days post-MI. Follow up was 362 +/- 241 days (70 deaths). The association between traditional time and frequency-domain HRV and mortality and nonlinear HRV and mortality were compared for the entire population (ALL), those without coronary artery bypass graft post-MI (no CABG), and those without CABG or diabetes (no CABG, no DIAB) using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Strength of association was compared by P values and Wald Chi-square values. Nonlinear HRV included short-term fractal scaling exponent, power law slope, and SD12 (Poincare dimension). For ALL and for no CABG, increased daytime SD12 had the strongest association with mortality (P=0.002 ALL and P {\textless}0.001 no CABG). For no CABG, no DIAB increased 24-hour SD12 hours had the strongest association (P {\textless}0.001) with mortality. Upon multivariate analysis, increased SD12, decreased ln ULF (ultra low frequency), and history of prior MI and history of congestive heart failure each remained in the model. CONCLUSION: Nonlinear HRV is associated with mortality post-MI. However, as with traditional HRV, this is diluted by CABG surgery post-MI and by diabetes. Results suggest that decreased long-term HRV and increased randomness of heart rate are each independent risk factors for mortality post-MI.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV), the beat-to-beat variation in either heart rate or the duration of the R-R interval - the heart period, has become a popular clinical and investigational tool. The temporal fluctuations in heart rate exhibit a marked synchrony with respiration (increasing during inspiration and decreasing during expiration - the so called respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA) and are widely believed to reflect changes in cardiac autonomic regulation. Although the exact contributions of the parasympathetic and the sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system to this variability are controversial and remain the subject of active investigation and debate, a number of time and frequency domain techniques have been developed to provide insight into cardiac autonomic regulation in both health and disease. It is the purpose of this essay to provide an historical overview of the evolution in the concept of HRV. Briefly, pulse rate was first measured by ancient Greek physicians and scientists. However, it was not until the invention of the "Physician's Pulse Watch" (a watch with a second hand that could be stopped) in 1707 that changes in pulse rate could be accurately assessed. The Rev. Stephen Hales (1733) was the first to note that pulse varied with respiration and in 1847 Carl Ludwig was the first to record RSA. With the measurement of the ECG (1895) and advent of digital signal processing techniques in the 1960s, investigation of HRV and its relationship to health and disease has exploded. This essay will conclude with a brief description of time domain, frequency domain, and non-linear dynamic analysis techniques (and their limitations) that are commonly used to measure HRV.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the stability of short recordings of heart rate variability (HRV) with time, and the association of HRV with age and sex. DESIGN: Five minute Holter recordings were made twice over a two month interval (tracking study). In addition, HRV was measured in a cross sectional study. SETTING: Residents of 11 Israeli kibbutzim were examined in their settlements. SUBJECTS: 32 men and 38 women (aged 31-67) participated in the tracking study and 294 (aged 35-65) were involved in the cross sectional study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time and frequency domain analyses on Holter recordings were undertaken in two breathing conditions: spontaneous and controlled breathing (15 respirations per minute). Regression was used to assess the relations of sex, age, heart rate, and logarithmically transformed HRV indices. RESULTS: HRV measures were highly consistent with time with correlations of 0.76-0.80 for high frequency and total power. Geometric mean total power declined with age by 45{\%} in men and 32{\%} in women, and was lower by 24{\%} among women than among men (all p {\textless} or = 0.005). Men had a 34{\%} higher very low and low frequency power and a higher ratio of low to high frequency power (p {\textless} 0.001). Conversely, high frequency power in women represents a greater proportion of total power than in men. CONCLUSION: Short recordings of HRV in a non-laboratory setting are stable over months and therefore characteristic of an individual. Strong age and sex effects were evident. HRV derived from short recordings can be informative in population based studies.},

abstract = {Background: This study addresses whether a unitary cardiac autonomic nervous system index (ANSI), obtained combining multiple metrics from heart rate variability (HRV) into a radar plot could provide an easy appreciation of autonomic performance in a clinical setting. Materials and Methods: Data are standardized using percentile ranking of autonomic proxies from a relatively large reference population (n = 1593, age 39 ± 13 years). Autonomic indices are obtained from autoregressive spectral analysis of (ECG derived) HRV at rest and during standing up. A reduced ANSI (using RR, RR variance and rest–stand difference of LFnu) is then constructed as a radar plot, quantified according to its combined area and tested against different risk subgroups. Results: With growing risk profile, there is a marked reduction of the rank value of ANSI, quantified individually by the radar plot area. The practical usefulness of the approach was tested in small groups of additional subjects putatively characterized by elevated or poor autonomic performance. Data show that elite endurance athletes are characterized by elevated values of ANSI (80{\textperiodcentered}6 ± 14{\textperiodcentered}9, P {\textless} 0{\textperiodcentered}001) while subjects with either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes show lower values (DM1 = 37{\textperiodcentered}0 ± 18{\textperiodcentered}9 and DM2 = 26{\textperiodcentered}8 ± 23{\textperiodcentered}3, P = 0{\textperiodcentered}002), and patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) represent a nadir (17 ± 20, P {\textless} 0{\textperiodcentered}001). Conclusions: This observational study shows the feasibility of testing simpler metrics of cardiac autonomic regulation based on a multivariate unitary index in a preventive setting. This simple approach might foster a wider application of HRV in the clinical arena, and permit an easier appreciation of autonomic performance.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop a physiological oscillator model of which the output mimics the shape of the R-R interval Poincar{\{}{\'{e}}{\}} plot. To validate the model, simulations of various nervous conditions are compared with heart rate variability (HRV) data obtained from subjects under each prescribed condition. For a variety of sympathovagal balances, our model generates Poincar{\{}{\'{e}}{\}} plots that undergo alterations strongly resembling those of actual R-R intervals. By exploiting the oscillator basis of our model, we detail the way that low- and high-frequency modulation of the sinus node translates into R-R interval Poincar{\{}{\'{e}}{\}} plot shape by way of simulations and analytic results. With the use of our model, we establish that the length and width of a Poincar{\{}{\'{e}}{\}} plot are a weighted combination of low- and high-frequency power. This provides a theoretical link between frequency-domain spectral analysis techniques and time-domain Poincar{\{}{\'{e}}{\}} plot analysis. We ascertain the degree to which these principles apply to real R-R intervals by testing the mathematical relationships on a set of data and establish that the principles are clearly evident in actual HRV records.},

Results support the mathematical equivalency of ratio units across studies, a reliance on those variables to explain autonomic outflow, and insufficient control of critical experimental variables.

The following sources of evidence are addressed: effects of manipulations affecting sympathetic and vagal activity on HRV, predictions of group differences in cardiac autonomic regulation from HRV, relationships between HRV and other cardiac parameters, and the theoretical and mathematical bases of the concept of autonomic balance. Available data challenge the interpretation of the LF and LF/HF ratio as indices of sympathetic cardiac control and autonomic balance, respectively, and suggest that the HRV power spectrum, including its LF component, is mainly determined by the parasympathetic system.},

abstract = {Power spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) has been used to indicate cardiac autonomic function. High-frequency power relates to respiratory sinus arrhythmia and therefore to parasympathetic cardiovagal tone; however, the relationship of low-frequency (LF) power to cardiac sympathetic innervation and function has been controversial. Alternatively, LF power might reflect baro reflexive modulation of autonomic outflows. We studied normal volunteers and chronic autonomic failure syndrome patients with and without loss of cardiac noradrenergic nerves to examine the relationships of LF power with cardiac sympathetic innervation and baroreflex function. We compared LF power of HRV in patients with cardiac sympathetic denervation, as indicated by low myocardial concentrations of 6-[F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity or low rates of norepinephrine entry into coronary sinus plasma (cardiac norepinephrine spillover) to values in patients with intact innervation, at baseline, during infusion of yohimbine, which increases exocytotic norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves, or during infusion of tyramine, which increases non-exocytotic release. Baroreflex-cardiovagal slope (BRS) was calculated from the cardiac interbeat interval and systolic pressure during the Valsalva maneuver. LF power was unrelated to myocardial 6-[F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity or cardiac norepinephrine spillover. In contrast, the log of LF power correlated positively with the log of BRS (r = 0.72, {\textless} 0.0001). Patients with a low BRS (‚{\^{a}}{\S}3 msec/mm Hg) had low LF power, regardless of cardiac innervation. Tyramine and yohimbine increased LF power in subjects with normal BRS but not in those with low BRS. BRS at baseline predicted LF responses to tyramine and yohimbine. LF power reflects baroreflex function, not cardiac sympathetic innervation.},

abstract = {Objectives: Heart rate variability (HRV) has gained recognition as a noninvasive marker of autonomic activity. HRV is considered a promising tool in various clinical scenarios. The optimal electrocardiogram (ECG) sampling frequency required to ensure sufficient precision of R–R intervals for HRV analysis has not yet been determined. Here, we aimed to determine the acceptable ECG sampling frequency range by analyzing ECG signals from patients who visited an emergency department with the chief complaint of acute intoxication or overdose. Methods: The study included 83 adult patients who visited an emergency department with the chief complaint of acute poisoning. The original 1,000-Hz ECG signals were down-sampled to 500-, 250-, 100-, and 50-Hz sampling frequencies with linear interpolation. R–R interval data were analyzed for time-domain, frequency-domain, and nonlinear HRV parameters. Parameters derived from the data on down-sampled frequencies were compared with those derived from the data on 1,000-Hz signals, and Lin's concordance correlation coefficients were calculated. Results: Down-sampling to 500 or 250 Hz resulted in excellent concordance. Signals down-sampled to 100 Hz produced acceptable results for time-domain analysis and Poincar{\'{e}} plots, but not for frequency-domain analysis. Down-sampling to 50 Hz proved to be unacceptable for both time-and frequency-domain analyses. At 50 Hz, the root-mean-squared successive differences and the power of high frequency tended to have high values and random errors. Conclusions: A 250-Hz sampling frequency would be acceptable for HRV analysis. When frequency-domain analysis is not required, a 100-Hz sampling frequency would also be acceptable.},

abstract = {This study evaluated the effects of propranolol on recovery of heart rate variability (HRV) after acute myocardial infarction and its relation to outcome in the Beta-blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT). Beta blockers improve mortality after acute myocardial infarction, but through an unknown mechanism. Depressed HRV, a measure of autonomic tone, predicts mortality after acute myocardial infarction. Whether $\beta$ blockers influence recovery of HRV after acute myocardial infarction, and thereby improve outcome, is unknown. We compared 24-hour HRV parameters at 1 week after acute myocardial infarction and after 6 weeks of treatment with propanolol (n = 88) or placebo (n = 96). The relation between 25-month outcome (death/acute myocardial infarction/congestive heart failure), propranolol treatment, and HRV was further analyzed. After 6 weeks, high-frequency (HF) power (log-normalized), an index of vagal tone, increased more in propranolol-treated patients (4.28 ± 0.1 to 5.17 ± 0.09 ms2) than in placebo-treated patients (4.26 ± 0.09 to 4.77 ± 0.1 ms2, p {\textless}0.05). Sympathovagal balance measured by the low-frequency (LF) to HF ratio increased in placebo-treated patients (3.55 ± 0.24 to 3.86 ± 0.24) but decreased in those treated with propranolol (3.76 ± 0.29 to 3.17 ± 0.23, p {\textless}0.01). Other frequency-domain parameters increased over time but were not affected by propranolol. Propranolol blunted the morning increase in the LF/HF ratio. Recovery of HF, the strongest HRV predictor of outcome, and propranolol therapy independently predicted outcome. In summary, after acute myocardial infarction, propranolol therapy improves recovery of parasympathetic tone, which correlates with improved outcome, and decreases morning sympathetic predominance. These findings may elucidate the mechanisms by which $\beta$ blockers decrease mortality and reduce the early morning risk of sudden death after acute myocardial infarction. {\textcopyright} 2003 by Excerpta Medica, Inc.},

abstract = {Evaluation of regional myocardial blood flow by conventional scintigraphic techniques is limited to the qualitative assessment of regional tracer distribution. Dynamic imaging with positron emission tomography allows the quantitative delineation of myocardial tracer kinetics and, hence, the measurement of physiologic processes such as myocardial blood flow. To test this hypothesis, positron emission tomographic imaging in combination with N-13 ammonia was performed at rest and after pharmacologically induced vasodilation in seven healthy volunteers. Myocardial and blood time-activity curves derived from regions of interest over the heart and ventricular chamber were fitted using a three compartment model for N-13 ammonia, yielding rate constants for tracer uptake and retention. Myocardial blood flow (K1) averaged 88 ± 17 ml/min per 100 g at rest and increased to 417 ± 112 ml/min per 100 g after dipyridamole infusion (0.56 mg/kg) and handgrip exercise. The coronary reserve averaged 4.8 ± 1.3 and was not significantly different in the septal, anterior and lateral walls of the left ventricle. Blood flow values showed only a minor dependence on the correction for blood metabolites of N-13 ammonia. These data demonstrate that quantification of regional myocardial blood flow is feasible by dynamic positron emission tomographic imaging. The observed coronary flow reserve after dipyridamole is in close agreement with the results obtained by invasive techniques, indicating accurate flow estimates over a wide range. Thus, positron emission tomography may provide accurate and noninvasive definition of the functional significance of coronary artery disease and may allow the improved selection of patients for revascularization. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

Methods and Results: TW-Ad was measured from standard digital 12-lead ECG in 5618 adults (46{\%} men; age, 50.9±12.5 years) participating in the Health 2000 Study - an epidemiological survey representative of the Finnish adult population. Independent replication was performed in 3831 participants of the KORA S4 Study (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg; 49{\%} men; age, 48.7±13.7 years; mean follow-up, 8.8±1.1 years).

Lower TW-Ad was univariately associated with SCD (0.32±0.36 versus 0.60±0.19; P{\textless}0.001); it had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.809. TW-Ad (≤0.46) conferred a hazard ratio of 10.8 (95{\%} confidence interval, 6.8-17.4; P{\textless}0.001) for SCD; it remained independently predictive of SCD after multivariable adjustment for clinical risk markers (hazard ratio, 4.6; 95{\%} confidence interval, 2.7-7.4; P{\textless}0.001).

abstract = {Power spectral analysis of the beat-to-beat variations of heart rate or the heart period (R–R interval) has become widely used to quantify cardiac autonomic regulation (Appel et al., 1989; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Denver et al., 2007; Thayler et al., 2010; Billman, 2011). This technique partitions the total variance (the “power”) of a continuous series of beats into its frequency components, typically identifying two or three main peaks: Very Low Frequency (VLF) {\textless}0.04 Hz, Low Frequency (LF), 0.04–0.15 Hz, and High Frequency (HF) 0.15–0.4 Hz. It should be noted that the HF peak is shifted to a higher range (typically 0.24–1.04 Hz) in infants and during exercise (Berntson et al., 1997). The HF peak is widely believed to reflect cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity while the LF, although more complex, is often assumed to have a dominant sympathetic component (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Billman, 2011). Based upon these assumptions, Pagani and co-workers proposed that the ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF) could be used to quantify the changing relationship between sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activities (i.e., the sympatho-vagal balance) (Pagani et al., 1984, 1986; Malliani et al., 1991) in both health and disease. However, this concept has been challenged (Kingwell et al., 1994; Koh et al., 1994; Hopf et al., 1995; Eckberg, 1997; Houle and Billman, 1999; Billman, 2011). Despite serious and largely under-appreciated limitations, the LF/HF ratio has gained wide acceptance as a tool to assess cardiovascular autonomic regulation where increases in LF/HF are assumed to reflect a shift to “sympathetic dominance” and decreases in this index correspond to a “parasympathetic dominance.” Therefore, it is vital to provide a critical assessment of the assumptions upon which this concept is based.},

Due to the emerging role of CMD as common denominator in different clinical phenotypes, additional research in this area is warranted to provide personalized treatments in this “garden variety” of patients. The purpose of this review is to describe the pathophysiological mechanisms of CMD and its mechanistic and prognostic role across different cardiovascular diseases. We will also discuss diagnostic modalities and the potential therapeutic strategies resulting from recent clinical studies.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV), the beat-to-beat variation in either heart rate or the duration of the R-R interval, has become a popular clinical and investigational tool (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Billman, 2011). Indeed, the term “heart rate variability” yields nearly 18,000 “hits” when placed in the pubmed search engine. These temporal fluctuations in heart rate exhibit a marked synchrony with respiration (increasing during inspiration and decreasing during expiration—the so called respiratory sinus arrhythmia) and are widely believed to reflect changes in cardiac autonomic regulation (Billman, 2011). Although the exact contributions of the parasympathetic and the sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system to this variability are controversial and remain the subject of active investigation and debate, a number of time and frequency domain techniques have been developed to provide insight into cardiac autonomic regulation in both health and disease (Billman, 2011). It is the purpose of this book to provide a comprehensive assessment of the strengths and limitations of HRV techniques. Particular emphasis will be placed on the application of HRV techniques in the clinic and on the interaction between prevailing heart rate and HRV. This book contains both state-of-the art review and original research articles that have been grouped into two main sections: Methodological Considerations and Clinical Application. A brief summary of the chapters contained in each section follows below.},

abstract = {Heart rate is under the precise control of the autonomic nervous system. However, the wiring of peripheral neural circuits that regulate heart rate is poorly understood. Here, we develop a clearing-imaging-analysis pipeline to visualize innervation of intact hearts in 3D and employed a multi-technique approach to map parasympathetic and sympathetic neural circuits that control heart rate in mice. We identify cholinergic neurons and noradrenergic neurons in an intrinsic cardiac ganglion and the stellate ganglia, respectively, that project to the sinoatrial node. We also report that the heart rate response to optogenetic versus electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve displays different temporal characteristics and that vagal afferents enhance parasympathetic and reduce sympathetic tone to the heart via central mechanisms. Our findings provide new insights into neural regulation of heart rate, and our methodology to study cardiac circuits can be readily used to interrogate neural control of other visceral organs. The wiring of peripheral neural circuits that regulate heart rate is poorly understood. In this study, authors used tissue clearing for high-resolution characterization of nerves in the heart in 3D and transgenic and novel viral vector approaches to identify peripheral parasympathetic and sympathetic neuronal populations involved in heart rate control in mice.},

@article{Liao1996,
abstract = {The shorter term beat-to-beat heart rate data collected from the general population are often interrupted by artifacts, and an arbitrary exclusion of such individuals from analysis may significantly reduce the sample size and/or introduce selection bias. A computer algorithm was developed to label as artifacts any data points outside the upper and lower limits generated by a 5-beat moving average ±25{\%} (or set manually by an operator using a mouse) and to impute beat-to-beat heart rate throughout an artifact period to preserve the timing relationships of the adjacent, uncorrupted heart rate data. The algorithm applies Fast Fourier Transformation to the smoothed data to estimate low-frequency (LF; 0.025-0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (HF; 0.16-0.35 Hz) spectral powers and the HF/LF ratio as conventional indices of sympathetic, vagal, and vagal-sympathetic balance components, respectively. We applied this algorithm to resting, supine, 2-min beat-to-beat heart rate data collected in the population-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study to assess the performance (success rate) of the algorithm (N = 526) and the inter- and intra-data-operator repeatability of using this computer algorithm (N = 108). Eighty-eight percent (88{\%}) of the records could be smoothed by the computer-generated limits, an additional 4.8{\%} by manually set limits, and 7.4{\%} of the data could not be processed due to a large number of artifacts in the beginning or the end of the records. For the repeatability study, 108 records were selected at random, and two trained data operators applied this algorithm to the same records twice within a 6-month interval of each process (blinded to each other's results and their own prior results). The inter-data-operator reliability coefficients were 0.86, 0.92, and 0.90 for the HF, LF, and HF/LF components, respectively. The average intra-data-operator reliability coefficients were 0.99, 0.99, and 0.98 for the HF, LF, and HF/LF components, respectively. These results indicate that this computer algorithm is efficient and highly repeatable in processing short-term beat-to-beat heart rate data collected from the general population, given that the data operators are trained according to standardized protocol.},

The intracellular agents found in the lesions of different animal species are antigenically similar. In addition, strains from the pig, ferret, and hamster have been shown to be genetically similar. In this study we performed a partial 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis on the intracellular agent of proliferative enteritis from a hamster, a deer, and an ostrich and compared these sequences to that of the porcine L. intracellularis isolate. Results of this study indicate that the intracellular agents from these species with proliferative enteritis have high sequence similarity, indicating that they are all in the genus Lawsonia and that they may also be the same species, L. intracellularis.},

@article{Clifford2005,
abstract = {Spectral estimates of heart rate variability (HRV) often involve the use of techniques such as the fast Fourier transform (FFT), which require an evenly sampled time series. HRV is calculated from the variations in the beat-to-beat (RR) interval timing of the cardiac cycle which are inherently irregularly spaced in time. In order to produce an evenly sampled time series prior to FFT-based spectral estimation, linear or cubic spline resampling is usually employed. In this paper, by using a realistic artificial RR interval generator, interpolation and resampling is shown to result in consistent over-estimations of the power spectral density (PSD) compared with the theoretical solution. The Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram, a more appropriate spectral estimation technique for unevenly sampled time series that uses only the original data, is shown to provide a superior PSD estimate. Ectopy removal or replacement is shown to be essential regardless of the spectral estimation technique. Resampling and phantom beat replacement is shown to decrease the accuracy of PSD estimation, even at low levels of ectopy or artefact. A linear relationship between the frequency of ectopy/artefact and the error (mean and variance) of the PSD estimate is demonstrated. Comparisons of PSD estimation techniques performed on real RR interval data during minimally active segments (sleep) demonstrate that the LS periodogram provides a less noisy spectral estimate of HRV.},

abstract = {Background: Prior work has found that linear heart rate variability (HRV) indices do not accurately reflect cardiac vagal control, and nonlinear indices of HRV have been proposed as alternative tools that may better capture cardiac vagal effects. We used progressive low dose atropine to induce changes in cardiac vagal tone to test the hypotheses that nonlinear HRV indices accurately reflect cardiac vagal control, and that their changes in response to low dose atropine correlate with those in RR interval. Methods: Changes in RR interval and HRV indices during intravenous injections of saline (control) and 6 cumulative doses of atropine (from 1.4 to 7.2 $\mu$g/kg) during controlled breathing at 15 breaths per minute were assessed in 14 young healthy individuals. Results: As expected, low dose atropine increased average RR interval (vagotonic effect). There was no strong association between vagotonic changes in RR interval and the majority of nonlinear HRV indices, either within or among subjects. Conclusions: These data suggest an inconsistent relationship between responses of nonlinear HRV indices and RR interval to changes in cardiac vagal tone. Therefore, nonlinear HRV indices may not be reliable indices of cardiac vagal control in healthy humans.},

The purpose of this pilot study is to establish and to gain insight on a set of features that could be used to detect psychophysiological changes that occur during chronic stress. This study elicited four different types of arousal by images, sounds, mental tasks and rest, and classified them using linear and non-linear HRV features from electrocardiograms (ECG) acquired by the wireless wearable ePatch{\textregistered} recorder. The highest recognition rates were acquired for the neutral stage (90{\%}), the acute stress stage (80{\%}) and the baseline stage (80{\%}) by sample entropy, detrended fluctuation analysis and normalized high frequency features. Standardizing non-linear HRV features for each subject was found to be an important factor for the improvement of the classification results.},
