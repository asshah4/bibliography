abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the predictive power of arrhythmia risk markers after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). BACKGROUND: Several risk variables have been suggested to predict the occurrence of sudden cardiac death (SCD), but the utility of these variables has not been well established among patients using medical therapy according to contemporary guidelines. METHODS: A consecutive series of 700 patients with AMI was studied. The end points were total mortality, SCD, and nonsudden cardiac death (non-SCD). Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (nsVT), ejection fraction (EF), heart rate variability, baroreflex sensitivity, signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG), QT dispersion, and QRS duration were analyzed (n = 675). Beta-blocking therapy was used by 97% of the patients at discharge and by 95% at one and two years after AMI. RESULTS: During a mean (+/-SD) follow-up of 43 +/- 15 months, 37 non-SCDs (5.5%) and 22 SCDs (3.2%) occurred. All arrhythmia risk variables differed between the survivors and those with non-SCD (e.g., the standard deviation of N-N intervals was 98 +/- 32 vs. 74 +/- 21 ms [p < 0.001] and the QRS duration was 103 +/- 22 vs.89 +/- 16 ms [p < 0.001]). Sudden cardiac death was weakly predicted only by reduced EF (<0.40; p < 0.05), nsVT (p < 0.05), and abnormal SAECG (p < 0.05), but not by autonomic markers or standard ECG variables. The positive predictive accuracy of EF, nsVT, and abnormal SAECG as predictors of SCD was relatively low (8%, 12%, and 13%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The common arrhythmia risk variables, particularly the autonomic and standard ECG markers, have limited predictive power in identifying patients at risk of SCD after AMI in the beta-blocking era.},

abstract = {Power spectral analysis (PSA) of heart rate variability (HRV) offers reliable assessment of cardiovascular autonomic responses, providing a 'window' onto the interaction of peripheral sympathetic and parasympathetic tone. Alterations in HRV are associated with various physiological and pathophysiological processes, and may contribute to morbidity and mortality. Previous studies of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) found lower resting HRV in patients compared to controls, suggesting increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic tone. This article describes the analysis of HRV at rest and after psychological stress in panic disorder (PD) patients, in an enlarged sample of PTSD patients, and in healthy control subjects. Standardized heart rate (HR) analysis was carried out in 14 PTSD patients, 11 PD patients and 25 matched controls. ECG recordings were made while subjects were resting ('rest 1'), while recalling the trauma implicated in PTSD, or the circumstances of a severe panic attack, as appropriate ('recall'), and again while resting ('rest 2'). Controls were asked to recall a stressful life event during recall. While both patient groups had elevated HR and low frequency (LF) components of HRV at baseline (suggesting increased sympathetic activity), PTSD patients, unlike PD patients and controls, failed to respond to the recall stress with increases in HR and LF. HRV analysis demonstrates significant differences in autonomic regulation of PTSD and PD patients compared to each other and to control subjects. HRV analysis may augment biochemical studies of peripheral measures in these disorders.},

@article{Rooks2012,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although early trauma (trauma in childhood) has been linked to adult inflammation and adult disease of inflammatory origin, it remains unknown whether this relationship is due to long-term consequences of early life stress or other familial factors.

METHODS: We examined 482 male middle-aged twins (241 pairs) born between 1946 and 1956 from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Childhood traumatic experiences, before the age of 18 years, were measured retrospectively with the Early Trauma Inventory and included physical, sexual, emotional abuse and general trauma. Lifetime major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease were also assessed. Plasma C-reactive protein and interleukin 6 were measured to determine levels of inflammation. Mixed-effects regression models with a random intercept for pair were used to separate between- and within-twin pair effects.

RESULTS: When twins were analyzed as individuals, increasing levels of early trauma were positively related to C-reactive protein (p = .03) but not to interleukin 6 (p = .12). When estimating within- and between-pair effects, only the between-pair association of early trauma with the inflammatory markers remained significant.

CONCLUSIONS: The link between early trauma and inflammation is largely explained by familial factors shared by the twins because levels of inflammation were highest when both twins were exposed to trauma. Exposure to early trauma may be a marker for an unhealthy familial environment. Clarification of familial factors associated with early stress and adult inflammation will be important to uncover correlates of stress and disease.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: We evaluated the association between linear standard Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measures and vascular, renal and cardiac target organ damage (TOD). METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed including 200 patients registered in the Regione Campania network (aged 62.4 +/- 12, male 64%). HRV analysis was performed by 24-h holter ECG. Renal damage was assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), vascular damage by carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), and cardiac damage by left ventricular mass index. RESULTS: Significantly lower values of the ratio of low to high frequency power (LF/HF) were found in the patients with moderate or severe eGFR (p-value < 0.001). Similarly, depressed values of indexes of the overall autonomic modulation on heart were found in patients with plaque compared to those with a normal IMT (p-value <0.05). These associations remained significant after adjustment for other factors known to contribute to the development of target organ damage, such as age. Moreover, depressed LF/HF was found also in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy but this association was not significant after adjustment for other factors. CONCLUSIONS: Depressed HRV appeared to be associated with vascular and renal TOD, suggesting the involvement of autonomic imbalance in the TOD. However, as the mechanisms by which abnormal autonomic balance may lead to TOD, and, particularly, to renal organ damage are not clearly known, further prospective studies with longitudinal design are needed to determine the association between HRV and the development of TOD.},

abstract = {An increasing number of studies has tested whether greater cardiovascular responses to acute mental stress predict future cardiovascular disease, but results have been variable. This review aimed quantitatively to evaluate the association between cardiovascular responses to laboratory mental stress and subsequent cardiovascular risk status in prospective cohort studies. We searched general bibliographic databases, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and PubMed, up to December 2009. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, quality, and estimates of associations. There were 169 associations (36 articles) of stress reactivity and 30 associations (5 articles) of poststress recovery in relation to future cardiovascular risk status, including elevated blood pressure, hypertension, left ventricular mass, subclinical atherosclerosis, and clinical cardiac events. The overall meta-analyses showed that greater reactivity to and poor recovery from stress were associated longitudinally with poor cardiovascular status (r=0.091 [95% CI: 0.050 to 0.132], P<0.001, and r=0.096 [95% CI: 0.058 to 0.134], P<0.001, respectively). These findings were supported by more conservative analyses of aggregate effects and by subgroup analyses of the methodologically strong associations. Notably, incident hypertension and increased carotid intima-media thickness were more consistently predicted by greater stress reactivity and poor stress recovery, respectively, whereas both factors were associated with higher future systolic and diastolic blood pressures. In conclusion, the current meta-analysis suggests that greater responsivity to acute mental stress has an adverse effect on future cardiovascular risk status, supporting the use of methods of managing stress responsivity in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease.},

@article{Sverrisdottir2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence from animal studies indicates the importance of an interaction between the sympathetic nervous system and the endothelium for cardiovascular regulation. However the interaction between these two systems remains largely unexplored in humans. The aim of this study was to investigate whether directly recorded sympathetic vasoconstrictor outflow is related to a surrogate marker of endothelial function in healthy individuals. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 10 healthy normotensive subjects (3 f/7 m), (age 37+/-11 yrs), (BMI 24+/-3 kg/m(2)) direct recordings of sympathetic action potentials to the muscle vascular bed (MSNA) were performed and endothelial function estimated with the Reactive Hyperaemia- Peripheral Arterial Tonometry (RH-PAT) technique. Blood samples were taken and time spent on leisure-time physical activities was estimated. In all subjects the rate between resting flow and the maximum flow, the Reactive Hyperemic index (RH-PAT index), was within the normal range (1.9-3.3) and MSNA was as expected for age and gender (13-44 burst/minute). RH-PAT index was inversely related to MSNA (r = -0.8, p = 0.005). RH-PAT index and MSNA were reciprocally related to time (h/week) spent on physical activity (p = 0.005 and p = 0.006 respectively) and platelet concentration (PLT) (p = 0.02 and p = 0.004 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that sympathetic nerve activity is related to a surrogate marker of endothelial function in healthy normotensive individuals, indicating that sympathetic outflow may be modulated by changes in endothelial function. In this study time spent on physical activity is identified as a predictor of sympathetic nerve activity and endothelial function in a group of healthy individuals. The results are of importance in understanding mechanisms underlying sympathetic activation in conditions associated with endothelial dysfunction and emphasise the importance of a daily exercise routine for maintenance of cardiovascular health.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV), the beat-to-beat variation in either heart rate or the duration of the R-R interval - the heart period, has become a popular clinical and investigational tool. The temporal fluctuations in heart rate exhibit a marked synchrony with respiration (increasing during inspiration and decreasing during expiration - the so called respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA) and are widely believed to reflect changes in cardiac autonomic regulation. Although the exact contributions of the parasympathetic and the sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system to this variability are controversial and remain the subject of active investigation and debate, a number of time and frequency domain techniques have been developed to provide insight into cardiac autonomic regulation in both health and disease. It is the purpose of this essay to provide an historical overview of the evolution in the concept of HRV. Briefly, pulse rate was first measured by ancient Greek physicians and scientists. However, it was not until the invention of the "Physician's Pulse Watch" (a watch with a second hand that could be stopped) in 1707 that changes in pulse rate could be accurately assessed. The Rev. Stephen Hales (1733) was the first to note that pulse varied with respiration and in 1847 Carl Ludwig was the first to record RSA. With the measurement of the ECG (1895) and advent of digital signal processing techniques in the 1960s, investigation of HRV and its relationship to health and disease has exploded. This essay will conclude with a brief description of time domain, frequency domain, and non-linear dynamic analysis techniques (and their limitations) that are commonly used to measure HRV.},

@article{Dolgoff-Kaspar2012,
abstract = {CONTEXT: Research shows that laughter has myriad health benefits, yet the medical community has not implemented it formally as a treatment. Patients awaiting organ transplantation have significant physical disabilities and are at risk for psychological distress. Attenuated heart rate variability (HRV) is a risk factor for a negative long-term outcome in some patients. OBJECTIVE: The study intended to evaluate the clinical utility of laughter yoga in improving psychological and physiological measures in outpatients awaiting organ transplantation. Positive results would indicate promising areas to pursue in a follow-up study. DESIGN: Six participants met for 10 sessions over 4 weeks. The research team measured each participant's heart rate, HRV, blood pressure (BP), and immediate mood before and after the laughter and control interventions. The team assessed participants' longer-term mood (anxiety and depression) at the study's initiation, after a no-treatment control week, and at the end of the study. SETTING: The study occurred at the Department of Surgery and Medicine at the University of Arizona Health Sciences Center, Tucson. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were patients awaiting transplants (three heart and three lung), two women and four men (ages 51-69 y). Participants had received no major surgery in the 3 months prior to the intervention, did not have a hernia or uncontrolled hypertension, and did not fall into the New York Heart Association function class 4. INTERVENTION: The 20-minute laughter intervention involved breathing and stretching exercises, simulated laughter (ie, unconditional laughter that is not contingent on the environment), chanting, clapping, and a meditation. The 20-minute control intervention involved the study's personnel discussing health and study-related topics with the participants. OUTCOME MEASURES: The research team measured BP, heart rate, and HRV and administered the Profile of Mood States, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory-II to evaluate immediate and longer-term mood. The team had planned quantitative statistical analysis of the data at the study's initiation but did not complete it because the number of enrolled participants was too low for the analysis to be meaningful. The team visually examined the data, however, for trends that would indicate areas to examine further in a follow-up study. RESULTS: Participants showed improved immediate mood (vigor-activity and friendliness) and increased HRV after the laughter intervention. Both the laughter and control interventions appeared to improve longer-term anxiety. Two participants awaiting a lung transplant dropped out of the study, and no adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that laughter yoga may improve HRV and some aspects of mood, and this topic warrants further research.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Early detection and start of appropriate treatment are highly correlated with survival of sepsis and septic shock, but the currently available predictive tools are not sensitive enough to identify patients at risk.

DESIGN: Linear (time and frequency domain) and nonlinear (unifractal and multiscale complexity dynamics) measures of beat-to-beat interval variability were analyzed in two mouse models of inflammatory shock to determine if they are sensitive enough to predict outcome.

SETTING: University research laboratory.

SUBJECTS: Blood pressure transmitter-implanted female C57BL/6J mice.

INTERVENTIONS: IV administration of tumor necrosis factor (n = 11) or lipopolysaccharide (n = 14).

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Contrary to linear indices of variability, unifractal dynamics, and absolute heart rate or blood pressure, quantification of complex beat-to-beat dynamics using multiscale entropy was able to predict survival outcome starting as early as 40 minutes after induction of inflammatory shock. Based on these results, a new and clinically relevant index of multiscale entropy was developed that scores the key features of a multiscale entropy profile. Contrary to multiscale entropy, multiscale entropy scoring can be followed as a function of time to monitor disease progression with limited loss of information.

CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of multiscale complexity of beat-to-beat dynamics at high temporal resolution has potential as a sensitive prognostic tool with translational power that can predict survival outcome in systemic inflammatory conditions such as sepsis and septic shock.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) who experience depressed mood or psychological stress exhibit decreased vagal control of heart rate (HR), as assessed by spectral analysis of HR variability (HRV). Myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death are independently associated with depression and stress, as well as impaired vagal HR control. This study examined whether a behavioral neurocardiac intervention to reduce stress or depression can augment cardiovagal modulation in CHD patients. We hypothesized that (1) cognitive-behavioral training with HRV biofeedback would augment vagal recovery from acute stress, and (2) vagal regulation of HR would be inversely associated with stress and depression after treatment. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial enrolled 46 CHD patients from 3 clinics of CHD risk reduction in Toronto and Vancouver, Canada. Subjects were randomized to five 1.5-hour sessions of HRV biofeedback or an active control condition. Outcome was assessed by absolute and normalized high-frequency spectral components (0.15-0.50 Hz) of HRV, and by the Perceived Stress Scale and Centre for Epidemiologic Studies in Depression scale. RESULTS: Both groups reduced symptoms on the Perceived Stress Scale (P = .001) and Centre for Epidemiologic Studies in Depression scale (P = .004). Hierarchical linear regression determined that improved psychological adjustment was significantly associated with the high-frequency index of vagal HR modulation only in the HRV biofeedback group. Adjusted R 2 was as follows: HRV biofeedback group, 0.86 for stress (P = .02) and 0.81 for depression (P = .03); versus the active control group, 0.04 (P = .57) and 0.13 (P = .95), respectively. CONCLUSION: A novel behavioral neurocardiac intervention, HRV biofeedback, can augment vagal HR regulation while facilitating psychological adjustment to CHD.},

abstract = {The relationship between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and high frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) was investigated during a resting baseline period and two 4-minute laboratory speech tasks. Participants were 20 women with PTSD and 20 age- and gender-matched controls. Parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) cardiac control was measured as HF-HRV (0.12-0.40 Hz) using power spectrum analysis. Participants with PTSD had significantly greater reductions in HF-HRV during two speech tasks (trauma recall and mental arithmetic) than control. These results suggest that PTSD is related to the magnitude of decrease in parasympathetic cardiac control during stress in women. Health implications of altered PNS activity associated with PTSD deserve further study.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Spectral analysis of heart rate variability has recently been shown to be a reliable noninvasive test for quantitative assessment of cardiovascular autonomic regulatory responses, providing a dynamic map of sympathetic and parasympathetic interaction. In a prior study exploring the state of hyperarousal characterizing the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) syndrome, the authors described standardized heart rate analysis carried out in 9 PTSD patients at rest, which demonstrated clear-cut evidence of a baseline autonomic hyperarousal state. METHODS: To examine the dynamics of this hyperarousal state, standardized heart rate analysis was carried out in 9 PTSD patients compared to a matched control group of 9 healthy volunteers. Twenty-minute recordings of electrocardiogram in response to a trauma-related cue as opposed to a resting state were performed and analyzed. The PTSD patients were asked to recount the presumed triggering traumatic event, and the control subjects recounted a significant stressful negative life event. RESULTS: Our results show that, whereas the control subjects demonstrated significant autonomic responses to the stressogenic stimulus supplied by the recounting of a major stressful experience, the PTSD patients demonstrated almost no autonomic response to the recounting of the triggering stressful event. The PTSD patients demonstrated a degree of autonomic dysregulation at rest which was comparable to that seen in the control subjects' reaction to the stress model. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of response to the stress model applied in the study appears to imply that PTSD patients experience so great a degree of autonomic hyperactivation at rest, that they are unable to marshal a further stress response to the recounting of the triggering trauma, as compared to control subjects.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is associated with increased cardiac mortality. A disturbed autonomic modulation of heart rate (HR) has been described in patients with schizophrenia in whom antipsychotic medication may represent an additional cardiac risk. The novel measure deceleration capacity (DC) of heart rate predicts cardiac mortality in patients with cardiovascular illnesses. The aim of the present paper was to calculate DC in patients with schizophrenia and to compare this measure with established parameters of heart rate variability (HRV).

METHODS: HRV and DC were calculated in 24-hour electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of 20 unmedicated, 40 medicated patients with schizophrenia and 40 controls. As activity has a major influence on HRV, 4-hour periods of "sleep-" and "wake-" ECG were evaluated as additional parameters. Actigraphy was used to ensure comparable levels of activity in patients and controls.

RESULTS: The DC as well as the other established HRV measures were not significantly different comparing unmedicated patients with schizophrenia to healthy controls. However, medicated patients showed a significant reduction of DC calculated from ECG recordings during 4 hour over night periods.

CONCLUSION: Calculation of DC might contribute to a better monitoring and identification of an increased risk of cardiac mortality in patients with schizophrenia undergoing antipsychotic treatment.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate the ability of microvolt-level T-wave alternans (MTWA) to identify prospectively patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) at risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmic events and to compare its predictive accuracy with that of conventional risk stratifiers. BACKGROUND: Patients with DCM are at increased risk of sudden death from ventricular tachyarrhythmias. At present, there are no established methods of assessing this risk. METHODS: A total of 137 patients with DCM underwent risk stratification through assessment of MTWA, left ventricular ejection fraction, baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), heart rate variability, presence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), signal-averaged electrocardiogram, and presence of intraventricular conduction defect. The study end point was either sudden death, resuscitated ventricular fibrillation, or documented hemodynamically unstable VT. RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 14 +/- 6 months, MTWA and BRS were significant univariate predictors of ventricular tachyarrhythmic events (p < 0.035 and p < 0.015, respectively). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that only MTWA was a significant predictor. CONCLUSIONS: Microvolt-level T-wave alternans is a powerful independent predictor of ventricular tachyarrhythmic events in patients with DCM.},

abstract = {Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prolonged reaction to an extremely traumatic experience. One of the core symptoms of PTSD is hyper-arousal which can be the result of an elevated activation of the autonomic nervous system. Including psychophysiological assessment methods in PTSD research can point to the neurobiological bases of the disorder. The studies of psychophysiology of PTSD to date have mostly measured reactivity. The aim of the current study was to compare resting state psychophysiology and startle reflexes in PTSD patients and controls in a sample of Croatian combat veterans. We measured heart-rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, skin conductance, and eyeblink muscle contraction during an acclimation period and during the presentation of startle stimuli in 45 male PTSD patients and 33 male healthy controls. We found that PTSD patient had elevated baseline heart-rate and decreased respiratory sinus arrhythmia compared to the controls. Furthermore, PTSD patients had impaired habituation to the startle probe, but there was no group difference in initial startle magnitude. There was also no group difference in skin conductance level or skin conductance response. Startle habituation and baseline heart-rate appear to offer the most reliable psychophysiological indices of PTSD. This finding replicates trends in the literature in a new population of PTSD patients.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Meditation practices are in use for relaxation and stress reduction. Some studies indicate beneficial cardiovascular health effects of meditation. The effects on the autonomous nervous system seem to vary among techniques. The purpose of the present study was to identify autonomic nerve activity changes during nondirective meditation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Heart rate variability (HRV), blood pressure variability (BPV), and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) were monitored in 27 middle-aged healthy participants of both genders, first during 20 min regular rest with eyes closed, thereafter practising Acem meditation for 20 min. Haemodynamic and autonomic data were collected continuously (beat-to-beat) and non-invasively. HRV and BPV parameters were estimated by power spectral analyses, computed by an autoregressive model. Spontaneous activity of baroreceptors were determined by the sequence method. Primary outcomes were changes in HRV, BPV, and BRS between rest and meditation. RESULTS: HRV increased in the low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) bands during meditation, compared with rest (p = 0.014, 0.013, respectively). Power spectral density of the RR-intervals increased as well (p = 0.012). LF/HF ratio decreased non-significantly, and a reduction of LF-BPV power was observed during meditation (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in BRS. Respiration and heart rates remained unchanged. Blood pressure increased slightly during meditation. CONCLUSION: There is an increased parasympathetic and reduced sympathetic nerve activity and increased overall HRV, while practising the technique. Hence, nondirective meditation by the middle aged may contribute towards a reduction of cardiovascular risk.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The predictive value of heart rate variability (HRV) in chronic heart failure (CHF) has never been tested in a comprehensive multivariate model using short-term laboratory recordings designed to avoid the confounding effects of respiration and behavioral factors. METHODS AND RESULTS: A multivariate survival model for the identification of sudden (presumably arrhythmic) death was developed with data from 202 consecutive patients referred between 1991 and 1995 with moderate to severe CHF (age 52+/-9 years, left ventricular ejection fraction 24+/-7%, New York Heart Association class 2.3+/-0.7; the derivation sample). Time- and frequency-domain HRV parameters obtained from an 8' recording of ECG at baseline and during controlled breathing (12 to 15 breaths/min) were challenged against clinical and functional parameters. This model was then validated in 242 consecutive patients referred between 1996 and 2001 (validation sample). In the derivation sample, sudden death was independently predicted by a model that included low-frequency power (LFP) of HRV during controlled breathing < or =13 ms2 and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter > or =77 mm (relative risk [RR] 3.7, 95% CI 1.5 to 9.3, and RR 2.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 6.3, respectively). The derivation model was also a significant predictor in the validation sample (P=0.04). In the validation sample, LFP < or =11 ms2 during controlled breathing and > or =83 ventricular premature contractions per hour on Holter monitoring were both independent predictors of sudden death (RR 3.0, 95% CI 1.2 to 7.6, and RR 3.7, 95% CI 1.5 to 9.0, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced short-term LFP during controlled breathing is a powerful predictor of sudden death in patients with CHF that is independent of many other variables. These results refine the identification of patients who may benefit from prophylactic implantation of a cardiac defibrillator.},

abstract = {The alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine reduces blood pressure more effectively in White than Black Americans despite similar degrees of sympatholysis. Functional genetic variation in receptor signaling mechanisms, for example in the beta 3 G-protein subunit (GNB3 C825T) and in the alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor subtype (ADRA2C del322-325), may affect drug responses. We examined the hypothesis that there are ethnic differences in the responses to the highly selective alpha(2)-agonist, dexmedetomidine, and that these genetic variants contribute to interindividual variability in drug responses. In a placebo-controlled, single-masked study, 73 healthy subjects (37 whites and 36 blacks) received 3 placebo infusions and then 3 incremental doses of dexmedetomidine (cumulative dose, 0.4 microg/kg), each separated by 30 minutes. Blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma catecholamine concentrations were determined after each infusion. We measured dexmedetomidine concentrations after the last infusion and determined ADRA2C del322-325 and GNB3 C825T genotypes. Dexmedetomidine lowered blood pressure and plasma catecholamine concentrations significantly (all P<0.001). There was substantial interindividual variability in the reduction of systolic blood pressure (range, 1 to 34 mm Hg) and plasma norepinephrine concentrations (range, 24 to 424 pg/mL). However, there were no differences between black and white subjects in dexmedetomidine responses (P>0.16 for all outcomes) before or after adjustment for covariates. Neither ADRA2C del322-325 nor GNB3 C825T genotypes affected the responses to dexmedetomidine (all P>0.66). There is large interindividual variability in response to the selective alpha(2)-AR agonist dexmedetomidine, and neither ethnicity nor ADRA2C and GNB3 genotypes contribute to it. Further studies to identify determinants of alpha(2)-AR-mediated responses will be of interest.},

PURPOSE: The purpose of the current review is to evaluate the evidence suggesting that PTSD increases cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors, and to identify possible biomarkers and psychosocial characteristics and behavioral variables that are associated with these outcomes.

METHODS: A systematic literature search in the period of 2002-2009 for PTSD, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disease was conducted.

RESULTS: The literature search yielded 78 studies on PTSD and cardiovascular/metabolic disease and biomarkers.

CONCLUSIONS: Although the available literature suggests an association of PTSD with cardiovascular disease and biomarkers, further research must consider potential confounds, incorporate longitudinal designs, and conduct careful PTSD assessments in diverse samples to address gaps in the research literature. Research on metabolic disease and biomarkers suggests an association with PTSD, but has not progressed as far as the cardiovascular research.},

Ten divers were exposed to pressures of 1, 2, 3, and 4 atmospheres absolute (ATA). The test was performed in a hyperbaric chamber. Heart rate (HR) was recorded in supine subjects for 10 minutes per atmosphere. HRV was analyzed in the frequency mode (fast-Fourier transform and continuous wavelet transform). Results confirmed bradycardia as pressure increased. The drop in HR attained statistical significance after 2, 3, and 4 ATA. Signal energy (normalized TP values) rose progressively, becoming significant at 2 ATA. High frequency and low frequency displayed similar behavior in both cases. Although frequency band peaks did not yield clear results, continuous wave transform analysis showed that the frequency spectrum tended to shift into the high-frequency range as pressure increased. In summary, increased pressure prompted increased bradycardia, and HRV shifted into high-frequency range.},

In the inflammatory reflex, sensory input elicited by infection or injury travels through the afferent vagus nerve to integrative regions in the brainstem, and efferent nerves carry outbound signals that terminate in the spleen and other tissues. Neurotransmitters from peripheral autonomic nerves subsequently promote acetylcholine-release from a subset of CD4(+) T cells that relay the neural signal to other immune cells, e.g. through activation of $\alpha$7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on macrophages. Here, we review recent progress in the understanding of the inflammatory reflex and discuss potential therapeutic implications of current findings in this evolving field.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical depression is associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients with a recent myocardial infarction (MI). Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) has been suggested as a possible explanation for this association. The purpose of this study was to determine if depression is associated with reduced HRV in patients with a recent MI. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three hundred eighty acute MI patients with depression and 424 acute MI patients without depression were recruited. All underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring after hospital discharge. In univariate analyses, 4 indices of HRV were significantly lower in patients with depression than in patients without depression. Variables associated with HRV were then compared between patients with and without depression, and potential confounds were identified. These variables (age, sex, diabetes, and present cigarette smoking) were entered into an analysis of covariance model, followed by depression status. In the final model, all but one HRV index (high-frequency power) remained significantly lower in patients with depression than in patients without depression. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that greater autonomic dysfunction, as reflected by decreased HRV, is a plausible mechanism linking depression to increased cardiac mortality in post-MI patients.},

abstract = {We present the phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA) method as an efficient technique for the study of quasi-periodic oscillations in noisy, nonstationary signals. It allows the assessment of system dynamics despite phase resetting and noise and in relation with either increases or decreases of the considered signal. We employ the method to study the quasi-periodicities of the human heart rate based on long-term ECG recordings. The center deflection of the PRSA curve characterizes the average capacity of the heart to decelerate (or accelerate) the cardiac rhythm. It can be measured by a central wavelet coefficient which we denote as deceleration capacity (DC). We find that decreased DC is a more precise predictor of mortality in survivors of heart attack than left ventricular ejection fraction, the current "gold standard" risk predictor. In addition, we discuss the dependence of the DC parameter on age and on diabetes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Decreased vagal activity after myocardial infarction results in reduced heart-rate variability and increased risk of death. To distinguish between vagal and sympathetic factors that affect heart-rate variability, we used a signal-processing algorithm to separately characterise deceleration and acceleration of heart rate. We postulated that diminished deceleration-related modulation of heart rate is an important prognostic marker. Our prospective hypotheses were that deceleration capacity is a better predictor of risk than left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN). METHODS: We quantified heart rate deceleration capacity by assessing 24-h Holter recordings from a post-infarction cohort in Munich (n=1455). We blindly validated the prognostic power of deceleration capacity in post-infarction populations in London, UK (n=656), and Oulu, Finland (n=600). We tested our hypotheses by assessment of the area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve (AUC). FINDINGS: During a median follow-up of 24 months, 70 people died in the Munich cohort and 66 in the London cohort. The Oulu cohort was followed-up for 38 months and 77 people died. In the London cohort, mean AUC of deceleration capacity was 0.80 (SD 0.03) compared with 0.67 (0.04) for LVEF and 0.69 (0.04) for SDNN. In the Oulu cohort, mean AUC of deceleration capacity was 0.74 (0.03) compared with 0.60 (0.04) for LVEF and 0.64 (0.03) for SDNN (p<0.0001 for all comparisons). Stratification by dichotomised deceleration capacity was especially powerful in patients with preserved LVEF (p<0.0001 in all cohorts). INTERPRETATION: Impaired heart rate deceleration capacity is a powerful predictor of mortality after myocardial infarction and is more accurate than LVEF and the conventional measures of heart-rate variability.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to provide a meta-analysis to estimate the performance of 12 commonly reported risk stratification tests as predictors of arrhythmic events in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. BACKGROUND: Multiple techniques have been assessed as predictors of death due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias/sudden death in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. METHODS: Forty-five studies enrolling 6,088 patients evaluating the association between arrhythmic events and predictive tests (baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate turbulence, heart rate variability, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, left ventricular ejection fraction, electrophysiology study, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, left bundle branch block, signal-averaged electrocardiogram, fragmented QRS, QRS-T angle, and T-wave alternans) were included. Raw event rates were extracted, and meta-analysis was performed using mixed effects methodology. We also used the trim-and-fill method to estimate the influence of missing studies on the results. RESULTS: Patients were 52.8 +/- 14.5 years of age, and 77% were male. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 30.6 +/- 11.4%. Test sensitivities ranged from 28.8% to 91.0%, specificities from 36.2% to 87.1%, and odds ratios from 1.5 to 6.7. Odds ratio was highest for fragmented QRS and TWA (odds ratios: 6.73 and 4.66, 95% confidence intervals: 3.85 to 11.76 and 2.55 to 8.53, respectively) and lowest for QRS duration (odds ratio: 1.51, 95% confidence interval: 1.13 to 2.01). None of the autonomic tests (heart rate variability, heart rate turbulence, baroreflex sensitivity) were significant predictors of arrhythmic outcomes. Accounting for publication bias reduced the odds ratios for the various predictors but did not eliminate the predictive association. CONCLUSIONS: Techniques incorporating functional parameters, depolarization abnormalities, repolarization abnormalities, and arrhythmic markers provide only modest risk stratification for sudden cardiac death in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. It is likely that combinations of tests will be required to optimize risk stratification in this population.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was to evaluate differences in heart rate variability (HRV) among post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients, depending on their participation in the Croatian war and on established diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS: The study included 34 male war veterans with diagnosed PTSD who had suffered a first MI and 34 age-matched post-MI patients without PTSD. Cardiac autonomic balance was evaluated through HRV analysis. RESULTS: There were no differences in the mean R-R interval or overall HRV between the analyzed groups. Post-MI patients with PTSD had lower values for the square root of the mean of squared successive differences in R-R intervals (p = 0.02), the percentage of R-R intervals that were > or =50 milliseconds different from the previous interval (p = 0.03), and the high-frequency component (p = 0.03) but had higher values for the low-frequency component (p = 0.01) and the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio (p = 0.02), compared with post-MI patients without PTSD. CONCLUSION: Post-MI patients with PTSD have higher sympathetic and lower parasympathetic heart rate modulation activity, compared with patients with MI and no PTSD.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Monitoring of regulated physiologic processes using physiomarkers such as heart rate variability may be important in the early diagnosis of subacute, potentially catastrophic illness. Early in the course of neonatal sepsis, there are physiomarkers of reduced heart rate variability and transient decelerations similar to fetal distress. The goal of this study was to determine the degree of increased risk for sepsis, urinary tract infection (UTI), and death when these abnormal heart rate characteristics (HRC) were observed. METHODS: We monitored 1022 infants at 2 tertiary care NICUs, 458 of whom were very low birth weight. We calculated an HRC index from validated regression models relating mathematical features of heart rate time series and histograms to episodes of illness. We calculated the risks for adverse events of sepsis, UTI, and death for infants stratified by HRC measurements. RESULTS: Compared with infants with low-risk HRC measurements, infants with high-risk HRC measurements had 5- to 6-fold increased risk for an adverse event in the next day and 3-fold increased risk in the next week. Laboratory tests that were relevant to infection added information to HRC measurements. Infants with both high-risk HRC and abnormal laboratory tests had 6- to 7-fold increased risk for an adverse event in the next day compared with infants who had neither. CONCLUSION: HRC are noninvasively monitored physiomarkers that identify infants in the NICU who are at high risk for sepsis, UTI, and death.},

abstract = {Background: High-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) is a measure of parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) output that has been associated with enhanced self-regulation. Low resting levels of HF-HRV are associated with nicotine dependence and blunted stress-related changes in HF-HRV are associated with decreased ability to resist smoking. Meditation has been shown to increase HF-HRV. However, it is unknown whether tonic levels of HF-HRV or acute changes in HF-HRV during meditation predict treatment responses in addictive behaviors such as smoking cessation. Purpose: To investigate the relationship between HF-HRV and subsequent smoking outcomes. Methods: HF-HRV during resting baseline and during mindfulness meditation was measured within two weeks of completing a 4-week smoking cessation intervention in a sample of 31 community participants. Self-report measures of smoking were obtained at a follow up 17-weeks after the initiation of treatment. Results: Regression analyses indicated that individuals exhibiting acute increases in HF-HRV from resting baseline to meditation smoked fewer cigarettes at follow-up than those who exhibited acute decreases in HF-HRV (b = -4.89, p = 0.008). Conclusion: Acute changes in HF-HRV in response to meditation may be a useful tool to predict smoking cessation treatment response.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Abnormalities in repolarization may reflect underlying myocardial pathology and play a prominent role in arrhythmogenesis The T-wave amplitude has been associated with cardiovascular outcome in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) Additionally, T-wave amplitude is considered a predictor of arrhythmias, as well as being related to an individual's inflammatory status. The combined influence of different variables, such as inflammation, cardiovascular risk factors and physical fitness status, on the T-wave amplitude has not been evaluated to date. The aim of this study was to identify factors that affect the T-wave amplitude.

METHODS: Data from 255 consecutive apparently healthy individuals included in the Tel Aviv Medical Center Inflammation Survey (TAMCIS) were reviewed. All patients had undergone a physical examination and an exercise stress test, and different inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers (fibrinogen, potassium, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) were measured.

RESULTS: Multivariate stepwise analysis revealed that the body mass index and the resting heart rate were significantly associated with the T-wave amplitude ($\beta$=-0.34, P < 0.001; $\beta$=-0.19, P = 0.03, respectively) in males, while the recovery rate and the usage of statins significantly affected the T-wave amplitude in females ($\beta$= 0.36, P = 0.002; $\beta$= 0.35, P = 0.002, respectively). Inflammatory variables had no significant affect on the T-wave amplitude of either gender.

CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the T-wave amplitude is linked to an individual's physical fitness and not to his/her inflammatory status.},

There are very few longitudinal studies that enable analyses of changes in HRV over time at an individual level. This study aimed to describe changes in HR and HRV in a general population setting and to determine predictors of HR and HRV at follow-up. From 1997 to 2004, 1,999 participants (29% women) in the United Kingdom Whitehall II Cohort Study had 2 measurements of cardiac autonomic function (mean time between measurements 5.47 years, range 4.07 to 6.93). The mean +/- SD age at the first measurement was 55.6 +/- 6.0 years. At baseline, men showed higher low-frequency power than women, suggesting that they may have higher sympathetic activity. Conversely, women had higher high-frequency power, indicating higher parasympathetic tone. Over the 5-year follow-up period, men and women had decreases in HR. Men had reductions in HRV in time and frequency dimensions, whereas women showed increases in HRV. In conclusion, the probability of being in the adverse quartile of HRV function and HR at follow-up was related to baseline exercise, body mass index, cholesterol, and blood pressure.},

abstract = {Venous occlusion plethysmography has been used to measure sympathetic vasoconstrictor responses in the feet and hands to a deep breath and body cooling and to assess blood flow variability. Measurements were made in 14 non-diabetic control subjects and 52 diabetic patients, 30 of whom had evidence of peripheral neuropathy. All the measurements were significantly reduced in the feet of patients with neuropathy. Vasoconstrictor responses were not significantly impaired in the hands of these patients. Cardiovascular autonomic function was assessed in the same subjects by standard tests of reflex heart rate responses and compared to sympathetic vasoconstrictor function as determined by the response to a deep breath. Eighteen of the 30 diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy had impairment of both cardiovascular and sympathetic vasoconstrictor function. Five had normal vasoconstrictor but impaired cardiovascular responses and two had normal cardiovascular but impaired vasoconstrictor function. It may therefore be important to assess both systems in diabetic patients.},

abstract = {There is growing evidence that rumination, perhaps specifically brooding rumination, is a core feature of depression and that it contributes to the development and maintenance of the disorder. A separate line of research has highlighted the role played by heart rate variability (HRV). Both brooding rumination and HRV appear to be driven by disruption in the same neural circuit, heightened amygdala reactivity combined with decreased prefrontal control, and both are highlighted in different units of analysis as reflecting the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) construct of Loss. However, little is known about the relation among these variables. In the current study, we predicted that higher levels of brooding rumination would be associated with lower levels of HRV and that women at high risk for future depression (i.e., those with a history of past major depressive disorder [MDD]) would exhibit higher levels of brooding and lower levels of HRV. We also examined genetic influences on the variables in this model. We predicted that COMT Val158Met genotype, which has been linked to heightened amygdala reactivity and deficits in prefrontal functioning, would be associated with brooding rumination and HRV, particularly among women with a history of past MDD. The results largely supported our hypotheses, providing additional support for relations among the different units of analysis for the Loss construct.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) develops following exposure to atraumatic event and is characterized by persistent intense reactivity to trauma related cues. Equally important, but less studied, is the failure to restore physiological homeostasis after these excessive reactions. This study investigates psychophysiological markers of sustained cardiac activity after exposure to reminders of traumatic event in PTSD patients. METHODS: Participants passively listened to neutral and personal traumatic event while electrocardiogram was continuously recorded. Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) were analyzed in 19 PTSD patients and 16 trauma-exposed controls. RESULTS: Both PTSD patients and trauma exposed controls exhibited a significant increase in HR to the exposure of their personal trauma. PTSD patients sustained the increase of HR while controls recovered to basal levels. In PTSD patients, sustained HR was positively associated with re-experiencing symptoms. The PTSD group also showed a reduced HRV (a measure of parasympathetic influence on the heart) during personal trauma exposure and lack of recovery. LIMITATIONS: The sample size was small and PTSD patients were under medication. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide an experimental account of the failure of PTSD patients to exhibit physiological recovery after exposure to trauma-related stimuli. PTSD patients exhibited a sustained tachycardia with attenuation of HRV that persisted even after cessation of the stressor. Re-experiencing symptoms facilitated engagement in the trauma cues, suggesting that, in their daily-life, patients most likely present repeated episodes of sustained over-reactivity, which may underpin the emotional dysregulation characteristic of PTSD.},

abstract = {We investigated a neural reflex that controls the strength of inflammatory responses to immune challenge - the inflammatory reflex. In anaesthetized rats challenged with intravenous lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 60 $\mu$g kg(-1)), we found strong increases in plasma levels of the key inflammatory mediator tumour necrosis factor $\alpha$ (TNF$\alpha$) 90 min later. Those levels were unaffected by previous bilateral cervical vagotomy, but were enhanced approximately 5-fold if the greater splanchnic sympathetic nerves had been cut. Sham surgery had no effect, and plasma corticosterone levels were unaffected by nerve sections, so could not explain this result. Electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that efferent neural activity in the splanchnic nerve and its splenic branch was strongly increased by LPS treatment. Splenic nerve activity was dependent on inputs from the splanchnic nerves: vagotomy had no effect on the activity in either nerve. Together, these data demonstrate that immune challenge with this dose of LPS activates a neural reflex that is powerful enough to cause an 80% suppression of the acute systemic inflammatory response. The efferent arm of this reflex is in the splanchnic sympathetic nerves, not the vagi as previously proposed. As with other physiological responses to immune challenge, the afferent pathway is presumptively humoral: the present data show that vagal afferents play no measurable part. Because inflammation sits at the gateway to immune responses, this reflex could play an important role in immune function as well as inflammatory diseases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction has been correlated with fasting insulin and glucose, independent of clinically diagnosed diabetes. We tested whether men and women (aged 45 to 64 years) from the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities study (n=8185) with ANS dysfunction, estimated by high heart rate (HR) and low HR variability (HRV), were at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Supine HR and HRV indices were measured for 2 minutes at baseline; indices were divided into quartiles for analyses. From 1987 to 1998 (mean follow-up 8.3 years), there were 1063 cases of incident diabetes. The relative risk (RR) of developing diabetes for participants with low-frequency (LF) power (0.04 to 0.15 Hz) HRV in the lowest quartile (<7.7 ms2) compared with the highest quartile (> or =38.9 ms2) was 1.2 (95% CI 1.0-1.4) after adjustment for age, race, sex, study center, education, alcohol drinking, current smoking, prevalent coronary heart disease, physical activity, and body mass index. Participants in the uppermost (>72.7 bpm) versus the lowest (< or =60.1 bpm) quartile of HR had a 60% increased risk (95% CI 33%-92%) of developing diabetes. Results were similar when the sample was restricted to participants with normal fasting glucose (glucose <6.1 mmol/L) at baseline (n=7192) or when adjusted for baseline glucose (HR quartile 4 versus quartile 1, RR=1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.7). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that ANS dysfunction may be associated with the development of diabetes in healthy adults.},

abstract = {AIMS:The density HRV parameter Dyx is a new heart rate variability (HRV) measure based on multipole analysis of the Poincar{\'{e}} plot obtained from RR interval time series, deriving information from both the time and frequency domain. Preliminary results have suggested that the parameter may provide new predictive information on mortality in survivors of acute myocardial infarction (MI). This study compares the prognostic significance of Dyx to that of traditional linear and nonlinear measures of HRV.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:In the Nordic ICD pilot study, patients with an acute MI were screened with 2D echocardiography and 24-hour Holter recordings. The study was designed to assess the power of several HRV measures to predict mortality. Dyx was tested in a subset of 206 consecutive Danish patients with analysable Holter recordings. After a median follow-up of 8.5 years 70 patients had died. Of all traditional and multipole HRV parameters, reduced Dyx was the most powerful predictor of all-cause mortality (HR 2.4; CI 1.5 to 3.8; P < 0.001). After adjustment for known risk markers, such as age, diabetes, ejection fraction, previous MI and hypertension, Dyx remained an independent predictor of mortality (P = 0.02). Reduced Dyx also predicted cardiovascular death (P < 0.01) and sudden cardiovascular death (P = 0.05). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, Dyx significantly predicted mortality in patients both with and without impaired left ventricular systolic function (P < 0.0001).\n\nCONCLUSION:The new nonlinear HRV measure Dyx is a promising independent predictor of mortality in a long-term follow-up study of patients surviving a MI, irrespectively of left ventricular systolic function.},

abstract = {Serotonin (5-HT) is crucial to normal reflex vagal modulation of heart rate (HR). Reduced baroreflex sensitivity [spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (sBRS)] and HR variability (HRV) reflect impaired neural, particularly vagal, control of HR and are independently associated with depression. In conscious, telemetered Flinders-Sensitive Line (FSL) rats, a well-validated animal model of depression, we tested the hypothesis that cardiovascular regulatory abnormalities are present and associated with deficient serotonergic control of reflex cardiovagal function. In FSL rats and control Flinders-Resistant (FRL) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat strains, diurnal measurements of HR, arterial pressure (AP), activity, sBRS, and HRV were made. All strains had normal and similar diurnal variations in HR, AP, and activity. In FRL rats, HR was elevated, contributing to the reduced HRV and sBRS in this strain. In FSL rats, sBRS and high-frequency power HRV were reduced during the night, indicating reduced reflex cardiovagal activity. The ratio of low- to high-frequency bands of HRV was increased in FSL rats, suggesting a relative predominance of cardiac sympathetic and/or reflex activity compared with FRL and SD rats. These data show that conscious FSL rats have cardiovascular regulatory abnormalities similar to depressed humans. Acute changes in HR, AP, temperature, and sBRS in response to 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, a 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1B), and 5-HT(7) receptor agonist, were also determined. In FSL rats, despite inducing an exaggerated hypothermic effect, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin did not decrease HR and AP or improve sBRS, suggesting impaired serotonergic neural control of cardiovagal activity. These data suggest that impaired serotonergic control of cardiac reflex function could be one mechanism linking reduced sBRS to increased cardiac risk in depression.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) are associated with altered autonomic function. Inflammation may provide a link between risk factors, autonomic dysfunction, and CAD. We examined the association between heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function, and inflammation, measured by C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). METHODS: We examined 264 middle-aged male twins free of symptomatic CAD. All underwent ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring and 24-hour ultra low, very low, low, and high-frequency power were calculated using power spectral analysis. C-reactive protein and IL-6 were measured, and risk factors including age, smoking, hypertension, lipids, diabetes, body mass index (BMI), depression, and physical activity were assessed. RESULTS: Physical activity, BMI, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, depression, and hypertension were directly associated with CRP and IL-6 and inversely associated with one or more HRV variables. There was a graded inverse relationship between all HRV parameters (except high frequency) and CRP and IL-6. After adjustment for age, BMI, activity, high-density lipoprotein, smoking, hypertension, depression, and diabetes, ultra low frequency and very low frequency remained significant predictors of CRP (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: C-reactive protein is associated with decreased HRV, even after controlling for traditional CAD risk factors. Autonomic dysregulation leading to inflammation may represent one pathway through which traditional risk factors promote development of CAD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of sudden cardiac death increases in populations who experience disasters such as earthquakes. The physiological link between psychological stress and sudden death is unknown; one mechanism may be the direct effects of sympathetic arousal on arrhythmias. To determine whether mental stress alters the induction, rate, or termination of ventricular arrhythmias, we performed noninvasive programmed stimulation (NIPS) in patients with defibrillators and ventricular tachycardia (VT), which is known to be inducible and terminated by antitachycardia pacing, at rest and during varying states of mental arousal. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighteen patients underwent NIPS in the resting-awake state (nonsedated). Ten underwent repeat testing during mental stress (mental arithmetic and anger recall). Induced VT was faster in 5 patients (P=0.03). VT became more difficult to terminate in 5 patients during mental stress; 4 required a shock (P=0.03). There was no change in ease of induction with mental stress. There was no evidence of ischemia on ECG or continuous ejection fraction monitoring. Eight patients received a shock in the resting-awake state and did not perform mental stress. Four underwent repeat NIPS after sedation; 3 then had induced VT terminated with antitachycardia pacing. All patients with an increase in norepinephrine of >50% had alterations in VT that required shock for termination (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Mental stress alters VT cycle length and termination without evidence of ischemia. This suggests that mental stress may lead to sudden death through the facilitation of lethal ventricular arrhythmias.},

Enthusiastic male ice hockey spectators (CAD n = 18, healthy subjects n = 16) attended Finnish national ice hockey play-off matches. Heart rate variability, plasma catecholamines, endothelin-1 (ET-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were determined at the baseline and during the match. A significantly more marked increase in both ET-1 and IL-6 was observed in CAD patients compared with healthy subjects during the match (time × group interaction p = 0.009 and p = 0.018 for ET-1 and IL-6, respectively). The high-frequency power of R-R intervals decreased in CAD patients (p<0.001) but did not change in healthy subjects (p = ns, time × group interaction p<0.001). Changes in adrenaline and noradrenaline did not differ between the groups. Emotional excitement causes more marked increases of markers of vasoconstriction and acute inflammation and withdrawal of cardiac vagal regulation in patients with CAD.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) reflects a prolonged stress reaction and dysregulation of the stress response system and is hypothesized to increase risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD). No study has tested this hypothesis in women even though PTSD is more prevalent among women than men. This study aims to examine whether higher levels of PTSD symptoms are associated with increased risk of incident CHD among women. DESIGN: A prospective study using data from women participating in the Baltimore cohort of the Epidemiologic Catchment Area study (n = 1059). Past year trauma and associated PTSD symptoms were assessed using the NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident CHD occurring during the 14-year follow-up through 1996. RESULTS: Women with five or more symptoms were at over three times the risk of incident CHD compared with those with no symptoms (age-adjusted OR = 3.21, 95% CI: 1.29-7.98). Findings were maintained after controlling for standard coronary risk factors as well as depression or trait anxiety. CONCLUSION: PTSD symptoms may have damaging effects on physical health for civilian community-dwelling women, with high levels of PTSD symptoms associated with increased risk of CHD-related morbidity and mortality.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart failure is associated with frequent hospitalizations, often resulting from volume overload. Measurement of intrathoracic impedance with an implanted device with an audible patient alert may detect increases in pulmonary fluid retention early. We hypothesized that early intervention could prevent hospitalizations and affect outcome.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 335 patients with chronic heart failure who had undergone implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator alone (18%) or with cardiac resynchronization therapy (82%). All devices featured a monitoring tool to track changes in intrathoracic impedance (OptiVol) and other diagnostic parameters. Patients were randomized to have information available to physicians and patients as an audible alert in case of preset threshold crossings (access arm) or not (control arm). The primary end point was a composite of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalizations. During 14.9±5.4 months, this occurred in 48 patients (29%) in the access arm and in 33 patients (20%) in the control arm (P=0.063; hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.97-2.37). This was due mainly to more heart failure hospitalizations (hazard ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.95; P=0.022), whereas the number of deaths was comparable (19 versus 15; P=0.54). The number of outpatient visits was higher in the access arm (250 versus 84; P<0.0001), with relatively more signs of heart failure among control patients during outpatient visits. Although the trial was terminated as a result of slow enrollment, a post hoc futility analysis indicated that a positive result would have been unlikely.

CONCLUSION: Use of an implantable diagnostic tool to measure intrathoracic impedance with an audible patient alert did not improve outcome and increased heart failure hospitalizations and outpatient visits in heart failure patients.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Information is limited about ECG predictors of the risk of incident congestive heart failure (CHF), particularly in women without overt manifestations of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated hazard ratios for incident CHF and all-cause mortality using Cox regression in 38,283 participants of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) during a 9-year follow-up. All risk models were adjusted for demographic and available clinical and therapeutic variables (multivariable-adjusted models). A backward selection procedure was used to identify dominant predictors among those that were significant as individual ECG predictors. Eleven ECG variables were significant predictors of incident CHF, with none of them having a significant interaction with baseline CVD status. From 6 dominant ECG predictors, wide QRS/T angle had a nearly 3-fold increased risk in multivariable-adjusted single ECG variable models. Two other repolarization variables, STV5 depression and high TV1 amplitude, and 2 QRS-related variables, QRS non-dipolar voltage and myocardial infarction (MI) by ECG, were all associated with &2-fold increase of incident CHF risk. Overall, 11 of the 12 ECG variables were significant predictors of all-cause mortality. Four variables had a significant interaction with CVD status requiring stratification. Three among these 4 were strong, dominant predictors in the CVD group: ECG MI, wide QRS/T angle, and low TV5 amplitude had risk increase from >2-fold to 3-fold, with considerably lower risks in the CVD-free group.

CONCLUSIONS: Several repolarization variables in postmenopausal women are predictors of the risk of incident CHF and all-cause mortality as important as old ECG MI.},

abstract = {Two symbolic indexes, the percentage of sequences characterized by three heart periods with no significant variations (0V%) and that with two significant unlike variations (2UV%), have been found to reflect changes in sympathetic and vagal modulations, respectively. We tested the hypothesis that symbolic indexes may track the gradual shift of the cardiac autonomic modulation during an incremental head-up tilt test. Symbolic analysis was carried out over heart period variability series (250 cardiac beats) derived from ECG recordings during a graded head-up tilt test (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 degrees ) in 17 healthy subjects. The percentage of subjects showing a significant linear correlation (Spearman rank-order correlation) with tilt angles was utilized to evaluate the performance of symbolic analysis. Spectral analysis was carried out for comparison over the same series. 0V% progressively increased with tilt angles, whereas 2UV% gradually decreased. The decline of 2UV% was greater than the increase of 0V% at low tilt angles. Linear correlation with tilt angles was exhibited in a greater percentage of subjects for 0V% and 2UV% than for any spectral index. Our findings suggest that symbolic analysis performed better than spectral analysis and, thus, is a suitable methodology for assessment of the subtle changes of cardiac autonomic modulation induced by a graded head-up tilt test. Moreover, symbolic analysis indicates that the changes of cardiac sympathetic and vagal modulations observed during this protocol were reciprocal but characterized by different absolute magnitudes.},

In this paper, we proposed a modified DC index based on improved phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA) algorithm. Sinusoidal analysis is applied to elucidate the rationality of the improved PRSA. Then the validity of the modified DC is verified by the databases of chronic heart failure (CHF) patients and control group. Both the conventional and modified DCs are significantly lower in CHF patients than that in the control group (2.12 +/- 2.98 vs. 6.34 +/- 1.92 ms, P < 0.0001 and 5.45 +/- 2.48 vs. 10.64 +/- 1.76 ms, P < 0.0001, respectively). And the modified DC provides higher accuracy in distinguishing CHF than the conventional one (87.4 vs. 82.1%). The results indicate that the suggested technique enhances the performance of PRSA and improves the efficiency of DC in assessing ANS activity in CHF patients.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Studies evaluating changes in HRV preceding the onset of ventricular arrhythmias using conventional techniques have shown inconsistent results. Time-frequency analysis of HRV is traditionally performed using short-term Fourier transform (STFT). Wavelet transform (WT) may however be better suited for analyzing non-stationary signals such as heart rate recordings.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied patients with a history of myocardial infarction implanted with a defibrillator with an extended memory. The RR intervals during the 51 min preceding ventricular events requiring electrical therapy were retrieved, and HRV studied by WT and STFT. 111 episodes of ventricular arrhythmia were retrieved from 41 patients (38 males, age 64 +/- 8 years). Heart rate increased significantly before arrhythmia. There was no significant variation in low frequency / high frequency components (LF/HF) observed for the group as a whole, probably due to a great degree of heterogeneity amongst individuals. A subset of 30 patients also had heart rate recordings performed during normal ICD follow-up. WT did not show any difference in HRV before arrhythmia onset and during control conditions.

CONCLUSION: Variations in HRV before onset of ventricular arrhythmias were not apparent in this large dataset, despite use of optimal tools for studying time-frequency analysis.},

It discusses the electrocardiographic phenomenon of T-wave alternans (TWA) (i.e., a beat-to-beat alternation in the morphology and amplitude of the ST-segment or T-wave). This statement focuses on its physiological basis and measurement technologies and its clinical utility in stratifying risk for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Signal processing techniques including the frequency-domain Spectral Method and the time-domain Modified Moving Average method have demonstrated the utility of TWA in arrhythmia risk stratification in prospective studies in >12,000 patients. The majority of exercise-based studies using both methods have reported high relative risks for cardiovascular mortality and for sudden cardiac death in patients with preserved as well as depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. Studies with ambulatory electrocardiogram-based TWA analysis with Modified Moving Average method have yielded significant predictive capacity. However, negative studies with the Spectral Method have also appeared, including 2 interventional studies in patients with implantable defibrillators. Meta-analyses have been performed to gain insights into this issue. Frontiers of TWA research include use in arrhythmia risk stratification of individuals with preserved ejection fraction, improvements in predictivity with quantitative analysis, and utility in guiding medical as well as device-based therapy. Overall, although TWA appears to be a useful marker of risk for arrhythmic and cardiovascular death, there is as yet no definitive evidence that it can guide therapy.},

abstract = {Many experimental and clinical studies have confirmed a continuous cross-talk between both sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of autonomic nervous system and inflammatory response, in different clinical scenarios. In cardiovascular diseases, inflammation has been proven to play a pivotal role in disease progression, pathogenesis and resolution. A few clinical studies have assessed the possible inter-relation between neuro-autonomic output, estimated with heart rate variability analysis, which is the variability of R-R in the electrocardiogram, and different inflammatory biomarkers, in patients suffering from stable or unstable coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure. Moreover, different indices derived from heart rate signals' processing, have been proven to correlate strongly with severity of heart disease and predict final outcome. In this review article we will summarize major findings from different investigators, evaluating neuro-immunological interactions through heart rate variability analysis, in different groups of cardiovascular patients. We suggest that markers originating from variability analysis of heart rate signals seem to be related to inflammatory biomarkers. However, a lot of open questions remain to be addressed, regarding the existence of a true association between heart rate variability and autonomic nervous system output or its adoption for risk stratification and therapeutic monitoring at the bedside. Finally, potential therapeutic implications will be discussed, leading to autonomic balance restoration in relation with inflammatory control.},

Resting, supine, 2-minute, beat-to-beat heart rate data were collected between 7 A.M. and 12 noon. The race- and sex-adjusted geometric means of low-frequency component (LF, 0.025 to 0.15 Hz) were 4.00 and 3.13 (beats/min)2; of high-frequency component (HF, 0.16 to 0.35 Hz), 1.65 and 1.21 (beats/min)2; and of the HF/LF ratio, 0.41 and 0.39, for 45-to-54 and 55-to-64 years age groups, respectively (test of mean difference by age, p < 0.01, p < 0.01, and p = 0.11 for LF, HF, and HF/LF ratio, respectively). Comparing black with white examinees, the age- and sex-adjusted geometric means of LF were 3.06 and 3.70 (beats/min)2; of HF, 1.66 and 1.36 (beats/min)2; of HF/LF, 0.54 and 0.37, respectively (test of mean difference by race, p < 0.01, p < 0.01, and p < 0.01).

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The study objectives were to create a cardiac metaiodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) database using multiple prospective cohort studies and to determine the quantitative iodine-123-labeled mIBG indices for identifying patients with chronic heart failure (HF) at greatest and lowest risk of lethal events.

BACKGROUND: Although the prognostic value of cardiac mIBG imaging in patients with HF has been shown, clinical use of this procedure has been limited. It is required to define universally accepted quantitative thresholds for high and low risk that could be used as an aid to therapeutic decision-making using a large cohort database.

METHODS: Six prospective HF cohort studies were updated, and the individual datasets were combined for the present patient-level analysis. The database consisted of 1,322 patients with HF followed up for a mean interval of 78 months. Heart-to-mediastinum ratio (HMR) and washout rate of cardiac mIBG activity were the primary cardiac innervation markers. The primary outcome analyzed was all-cause death.

RESULTS: Lethal events were observed in 326 patients, and the population mortality rate was 5.6%, 11.3%, and 19.7% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard model analysis for all-cause mortality identified age (p < 0.0001), New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class (p < 0.0001), late HMR of cardiac mIBG activity (p < 0.0001), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (p = 0.0029) as significant independent predictors. Analysis of the 512-patient subpopulation with B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) results showed BNP (p < 0.0001), greater NYHA functional class (p = 0.0002), and late HMR (p = 0.0011) as significant predictors, but LVEF was not. The receiver-operating characteristic-determined threshold of HMR (1.68) identified patients at significantly increased risk in any LVEF category. Survival rates decreased progressively with decreasing HMR, with 5-year all-cause mortality rates >7% annually for HMR <1.25, and <2% annually for HMR ≥1.95. Addition of HMR to clinical information resulted in a significant net reclassification improvement of 0.175 (p < 0.0001).

CONCLUSIONS: Pooled analyses of independent cohort studies confirmed the long-term prognostic value of cardiac mIBG uptake in patients with HF independently of other markers, such as NYHA functional class, BNP, and LVEF, and demonstrated that categoric assessments could be used to define meaningful thresholds for lethal event risk.},

Therefore, in this study we analyzed the heart rate variability (HRV) in different levels of practice in Zen meditation (Zazen). Nineteen subjects with variable experience took part in this study. In four special cases we collected both HRV and respiration data. The time series were analyzed in frequency domain and also using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, which detects changes in the time domain and in the frequency domain simultaneously. The shifts in the respiratory modulation of heart rate, or respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), reflect the different levels of practice among practitioners with variable experience in Zazen; in turn the modulation of the RSA may reflect changes in the breathing pattern as in the parasympathetic outflow related to the quality and focus of attention in each stage.},

abstract = {Introduction: Mental stress ischemia (MSI) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular outcomes and death in CAD patients, but little is known about the mechanisms behind this phenomenon. We hypothesized that alterations in autonomic function before, during, or after mental stress may play a role. We examined whether MSI positive patients with CAD have reduced parasympathetic (PNS) tone, as measured by high frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV), as well as reduced baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS), as approximated by low frequency (LF) HRV at baseline, peak mental stress, and recovery.\r\n\r\nMethods: A mental stress test with a standardized speech stressor was performed in 425 CAD patients wearing an ambulatory ECG monitor. Myocardial perfusion imaging was performed with TC-99m Sestamibi. After careful editing for artifacts and ectopic beats, HF HRV and LF HRV were measured for 5-min periods during a baseline rest period, 5 min of speech, and 5 min of recovery. Logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounders.\r\n\r\nResults: The mean (SD) age was 63 (9) years, 26% were women, and 30% were African American; 42 (10%) patients developed MSI. Compared with MSI negative, MSI positive patients had lower HF HRV and LF HRV during rest, stress, and recovery. The largest difference was observed during stress; HF HRV was 46% lower (p=0.01), and LF HRV was 44% lower (p=0.01). When examining reactivity to stress (difference between stress and rest), only LF HRV was significantly different between groups, such that MSI positive patients had an average 32% reduction in LF HRV with stress, while MSI negative patients had an average 3% increase (p=0.04). LF HRV reactivity remained an independent predictor of MSI (p=0.01) in models adjusting for sociodemographics, traditional risk factors, antidepressants, beta-blocker use, revascularization history, heart failure, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and heart rate/blood pressure reactivity.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Autonomic factors, most notably reduced LF HRV reactivity, predict MSI in CAD patients. This implies reduced BRS and autonomic inflexibility as an important pathophysiological component of the ischemic response to mental stress.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence exists linking major depressive disorder (MDD) with clinical cardiovascular events. The importance of the sympathetic nervous system in the generation of cardiac risk in other contexts is established.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the importance of the sympathetic nervous system in the generation of cardiac risk in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).

METHODS: Studies were performed in 39 patients meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV) criteria for MDD and in 76 healthy subjects. Treatment for patients consisted of selective serotonin reuptake inhibition (SSRI) for 12 weeks. Whole body and cardiac sympathetic activity were examined using noradrenaline isotope dilution methodology and sympathetic nerve recording techniques. Measurement of the extraction of infused tritiated noradrenaline by the heart, and estimation of cardiac dihydroxyphenylglycol production provided direct quantification of neuronal noradrenaline reuptake.

RESULTS: Sympathetic activity, particularly in the heart and for the whole body, in patients with MDD followed a bimodal distribution. Elevated values were observed in patients with co-morbid panic disorder (P = 0.006). Consistent with a defect in noradrenaline reuptake, the cardiac extraction of tritiated noradrenaline (0.80 +/- 0.01 versus 0.56 +/- 0.04%, P < 0.001) and cardiac dihydroxyphenylglycol overflow (109 +/- 8 versus 73 +/- 11, P = 0.01) were reduced in patients with MDD. SSRI therapy abolished the excessive sympathetic activation, with whole body noradrenaline spillover falling from 518 +/- 83 to 290 +/- 41 ng/min (P = 0.008).

CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a subset of patients with MDD in whom sympathetic nervous activity is extraordinarily high, including in the sympathetic outflow to the heart. Treatment with an SSRI may reduce sympathetic activity in a manner likely to reduce cardiac risk.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Arrhythmia risk stratification with regard to prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy is a completely unsolved issue in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC).

METHODS AND RESULTS: Arrhythmia risk stratification was performed prospectively in 343 patients with IDC, including analysis of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and size by echocardiography, signal-averaged ECG, arrhythmias on Holter ECG, QTc dispersion, heart rate variability, baroreflex sensitivity, and microvolt T-wave alternans. During 52+/-21 months of follow-up, major arrhythmic events, defined as sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or sudden death, occurred in 46 patients (13%). On multivariate analysis, LV ejection fraction was the only significant arrhythmia risk predictor in patients with sinus rhythm, with a relative risk of 2.3 per 10% decrease of ejection fraction (95% CI, 1.5 to 3.3; P=0.0001). Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on Holter was associated with a trend toward higher arrhythmia risk (RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.9 to 3.3; P=0.11), whereas beta-blocker therapy was associated with a trend toward lower arrhythmia risk (RR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.3 to 1.2; P=0.13). In patients with atrial fibrillation, multivariate Cox analysis also identified LV ejection fraction and absence of beta-blocker therapy as the only significant arrhythmia risk predictors.

CONCLUSIONS: Reduced LV ejection fraction and lack of beta-blocker use are important arrhythmia risk predictors in IDC, whereas signal-averaged ECG, baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate variability, and T-wave alternans do not seem to be helpful for arrhythmia risk stratification. These findings have important implications for the design of future studies evaluating prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy in IDC.},

abstract = {The vagal (high frequency [HF]) component of heart rate variability (HRV) predicts survival in post-myocardial infarction patients and is considered to reflect vagal antagonism of sympathetic influences. Previous studies of the neural correlates of vagal tone involved mental stress tasks that included cognitive and emotional elements. To differentiate the neural substrates of vagal tone due to emotion, we correlated HF-HRV with measures of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) derived from positron emission tomography (PET) and (15)O-water in 12 healthy women during different emotional states. Happiness, sadness, disgust and three neutral conditions were each induced by film clips and recall of personal experiences (12 conditions). Inter-beat intervals derived from electrocardiographic recordings during the 60-second scans were spectrally-analyzed, generating 12 separate measures of HF-HRV in each subject. The six emotion and six neutral conditions were grouped together and contrasted. We observed substantial overlap between emotion-specific rCBF and the correlation between emotion-specific rCBF and HF-HRV, particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex. Emotion-specific rCBF also correlated with HF-HRV in the caudate nucleus, periacqueductal gray and left mid-insula. We also observed that the elements of cognitive control inherent in this experiment (that involved focusing on the target mental state) had definable neural substrates that correlated with HF-HRV and to a large extent differed from the emotion-specific correlates of HF-HRV. No statistically significant asymmetries were observed. Our findings are consistent with the view that the medial visceromotor network is a final common pathway by which emotional and cognitive functions recruit autonomic support.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart failure patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) or an ICD for resynchronization therapy often visit the hospital for unscheduled examinations, placing a great burden on healthcare providers. We hypothesized that Internet-based remote interrogation systems could reduce emergency healthcare visits. METHODS AND RESULTS: This multicenter randomized trial involving 200 patients compared remote monitoring with standard patient management consisting of scheduled visits and patient response to audible ICD alerts. The primary end point was the rate of emergency department or urgent in-office visits for heart failure, arrhythmias, or ICD-related events. Over 16 months, such visits were 35% less frequent in the remote arm (75 versus 117; incidence density, 0.59 versus 0.93 events per year; P=0.005). A 21% difference was observed in the rates of total healthcare visits for heart failure, arrhythmias, or ICD-related events (4.40 versus 5.74 events per year; P<0.001). The time from an ICD alert condition to review of the data was reduced from 24.8 days in the standard arm to 1.4 days in the remote arm (P<0.001). The patients' clinical status, as measured by the Clinical Composite Score, was similar in the 2 groups, whereas a more favorable change in quality of life (Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire) was observed from the baseline to the 16th month in the remote arm (P=0.026). CONCLUSIONS: Remote monitoring reduces emergency department/urgent in-office visits and, in general, total healthcare use in patients with ICD or defibrillators for resynchronization therapy. Compared with standard follow-up through in-office visits and audible ICD alerts, remote monitoring results in increased efficiency for healthcare providers and improved quality of care for patients.

abstract = {Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) has been widely used as a measure of the cardiac vagal control in response to stress. However, RSA seems not to be a generalized indicator because of its dependency on respiratory parameter and individual variations of RSA amplitude (A(RSA)). We hypothesized that phase-lag variations between RSA and respiration may serve as a normalized index of the degree of mental stress. Twenty healthy volunteers performed mental arithmetic task (ART) after 5 min of resting control followed by 5 min of recovery. Breathing pattern, beat-to-beat R-R intervals, and blood pressure (BP) were determined using inductance plethysmography, electrocardiography, and a Finapres device, respectively. The analytic signals of breathing and RSA were obtained by Hilbert transform and the degree of phase synchronization (lambda) was quantified. With the use of spectral analysis, heart rate variability (HRV) was estimated for the low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) bands. A steady-state 3-min resting period (REST), the first 3 min (ART1), and the last 3 min (ART2) of the ART period (ranged from 6- to 19 min) and the last 3 min of the recovery period (RCV) were analyzed separately. Heart rate, systolic BP, and breathing frequency (f(R)) increased and lambda, A(RSA), and HF power decreased from REST to ART (P < 0.01). The lambda was correlated with normalized A(RSA) and the HF power. The decrease in lambda could not be explained solely by the increase in f(R). We conclude that mental stress exerts an influence on RSA oscillations, inducing incoherent phase lag with respect to breathing, in addition to a decrease in RSA.},

As such, in this special issue we present further evidence implicating that cardiovascular and stress hormone responses to acute stress at the other end of the response spectrum can also be considered a pathway to ill health. In this introductory article, we explore and review the origins of and potential mechanisms underlying blunted responses to acute stress. In so doing, we aim to highlight: what is currently known regarding this new conceptualization of the reactivity hypothesis; the potential explanations for blunted reactivity; the pathways underlying associations with health outcomes; and where this field is headed in terms of developing our understanding of the link between reactivity and health.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Evidence of elevated basal heart rate (HR) in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been interpreted in terms of elevated sympathetic cardiac activity, as have possible increased cardiovascular disease risks and outcomes associated with elevated HR. Yet it is well-established that the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system not only influences HR independently of the sympathetic branch, but makes a greater contribution to HR, including resting HR. Additionally, abnormally low tonic parasympathetic activity on the heart has been implicated in cardiovascular disease and hypertension. This study addressed a potential parasympathetic contribution to elevated basal HR in PTSD. METHODS: We used a descriptive and subgroup differences approach to investigate relationships between parasympathetic activity and basal HR in 59 adults (50 females) with PTSD, all of whom were participants in a treatment outcome study and assessed prior to exposure to trauma-related script-driven imagery. Consistent with the well-known relationship between parasympathetic activity and HR, we hypothesized that basal respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a measure of parasympathetic cardiac activity, would be negatively correlated with basal HR. More important, we predicted that pathologically elevated HRs previously associated with PTSD would only characterize a low-RSA subgroup. Potential confounds of age, respiration rate, and aerobic fitness were addressed. RESULTS: As predicted, mean HR was 80.5 bpm in the low-RSA tercile group, similar to mean HRs of PTSD groups in prior research and significantly higher than 69 and 65 bpm in the middle- and high-RSA groups, respectively, which are typical of non-PTSD controls. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that a substantial proportion of those with PTSD may not have elevated basal HRs. Furthermore, among those who do exhibit elevated HR, there may be a parasympathetic contribution that is independent of any sympathetic one. Only measuring both branches at once, ideally with autonomic blockades, can definitively address these issues.},

abstract = {Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) and increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are both predictors of coronary artery disease and correlate with each other. We examined whether these 2 phenotypes share a common genetic substrate and investigated the relations of the CRP gene polymorphisms with both CRP levels and HRV indexes. We examined 236 male twins free of symptomatic coronary artery disease, with a mean age +/- SD of 54 +/- 2.9 years. The plasma CRP levels were measured and the frequency domain measures of HRV were assessed using a 24-hour electrocardiographic recording, including ultra-low-, very-low-, low-, and high-frequency power. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CRP gene were genotyped. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association between CRP and HRV, as well as the genotype-phenotype association. Bivariate structural equation modeling was performed to estimate the genetic and environmental correlations between CRP and HRV and the explanatory effect of CRP gene polymorphisms on the CRP-HRV association. Both CRP (h(2) = 0.76) and HRV indexes (h(2) = 0.56 to 0.64) showed high heritability. Greater CRP levels were significantly associated with lower HRV. A robust genetic correlation was found between CRP and ultra-low-frequency power (r(G) = -0.3, p = 0.001). One CRP single nucleotide polymorphism (rs1205) was significantly associated with both CRP (p = 0.003) and ultra-low-frequency power (p = 0.005) and explained 11% of the genetic covariance between them. In conclusion, reduced HRV correlates significantly with increased CRP plasma levels and this correlation is due, in large part, to common genetic influences. A polymorphism in the CRP gene contributes to both CRP levels and HRV.},

Twenty-one women with current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 23 with lifetime but not current PTSD, and 13 women who never had PTSD listened to 15 95-dB, 500-ms, 1000-Hz tones with a 0-ms rise time while heart rate (HR), skin conductance (SC), and orbicularis oculi electromyogram (EMG) responses were measured. Participants in the current and lifetime PTSD groups produced larger HR responses across tones and showed slower absolute habituation of SC response magnitude compared with the never PTSD group. EMG response magnitudes did not differ among groups. Women with CSA-related PTSD showed increased autonomic reactivity and slower habituation to high-intensity tones similar to that observed in primarily male, combat PTSD samples. This suggests that heightened autonomic responsivity to startling stimuli in PTSD is not gender or event specific.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Trauma is associated with increased risk for anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To further understand biologic mechanisms of PTSD, we examined the dark-enhanced startle response, a psychophysiological correlate of anxiety, and heart rate variability (HRV) in traumatized individuals with and without PTSD. The associations of these measures with PTSD may be sex-specific because of their associations with the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, a sexually dimorphic brain structure in the limbic system that is approximately 2.5 times larger in men than in women. METHODS: The study sample (N = 141) was recruited from a highly traumatized civilian population seeking treatment at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. Psychophysiological responses during a dark-enhanced startle paradigm task included startle magnitude, assessed by eyeblink reflex, and measures of high-frequency HRV, during light and dark phases of the startle session. RESULTS: The startle magnitude was higher during the dark phase than the light phase (mean +/- standard error = 98.61 +/- 10.68 versus 73.93 +/- 8.21 muV, p < .001). PTSD was associated with a greater degree of dark-enhanced startle in women (p = .03) but not in men (p = .38, p interaction = .48). Although HRV measures did not differ between phases, high-frequency HRV was greater in men with PTSD compared with men without PTSD (p = .02). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the dark-enhanced paradigm provides novel insights into the psychophysiological responses associated with PTSD in traumatized civilian sample. Sex differences in altered parasympathetic and sympathetic function during anxiety regulation tasks may provide further insight into the neurobiological mechanisms of PTSD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) functioning was investigated using baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). We hypothesized that individuals with PTSD would exhibit lower BRS than those without PTSD. METHODS: Participants were 80 PTSD patients and 50 controls aged 18-68 years. All participants were smokers, many were veterans (55%), and 60 were women. Beat-to-beat BP was collected during a 5-min baseline rest periods from which estimates of BRS were derived using the sequence method. RESULTS: Women with PTSD exhibited lower BRS (M = 10.5, S.D. = 5.1) than women without PTSD (M = 14.6, S.D. = 10.7). For men, PTSD diagnosis was not associated with BRS, p > .05. CONCLUSIONS: Among women, PTSD was associated with reduced PNS functioning. Men with PTSD did not have attenuated BRS, which may be due to sample characteristics, such as age and combat veteran status. Reduced PNS activity may predispose women with PTSD to poorer cardiovascular health.},

abstract = {We report a novel approach to the determination of sleep apnea based on measuring the peripheral circulatory responses in a primary condition of disordered breathing. The apparatus is a finger plethysmograph coupled to a constant volume, variable pressure, pneumatic system. The plethysmograph's tip (measurement site) is composed of two parallel opposing longitudinal half thimbles, which is attached to a contiguous annular cuff. Each compartment consists of an internal membrane surrounded by an outer rigid wall. These provide a uniform pressure field and impart a two-point locking action preventing axial and longitudinal motion of the finger. Subdiastolic pressure is applied to prevent venous pooling, engorgement, and stasis, to inhibit retrograde venous shock wave propagation and partially unload arterial wall tension. The annular cuff extends the effective boundary of the pressure field beyond the measuring site. In 42 patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) profound, transient vasoconstriction and tachycardia usually of a periodic nature, were clearly seen with each apneic event, possibly related to transient arousal. Good agreement was found between standard total apnea-hypopnea scoring, 129.5+/-22.4 (Mean +/- SEM), and transient vasoconstriction and tachycardia events, 121.2+/-19.4 (R = .92, p<.0001). We conclude that the finger tip exemplifies the scope of peripheral vascular responsiveness due to its high density of alpha sympathetic innervation, and its high degree of blood flow rate lability. Given that elevated peripheral resistance and tightly linked transient heart rate elevation is a consistent part of the hemodynamic response to arousal and OSAS, we believe that pulsatile finger blood flow patterns can be clearly diagnostic of OSAS and other sleep-disordered breathing conditions.},

abstract = {Elevated psychosocial stress might favor the occurrence of cardiovascular disease; however, mechanisms are incompletely understood. We hypothesized that patients (n=126; 44+/-1 years of age) referred to an internal medicine clinic because of symptoms related to chronic psychosocial stress would demonstrate signs of autonomic dysregulation compared with controls (n=132; 42+/-1 years of age). We used autoregressive spectral analysis of RR interval variability to obtain indirect markers of sympathetic and of vagal (respectively, low-frequency and high-frequency components, both expressed in normalized units) oscillatory modulation of sinoatrial node, as well as of sympathetic vasomotor regulation (low-frequency component of systolic arterial pressure variability) and of cardiac baroreflex sensitivity (alpha-index). Higher values of systolic and diastolic arterial pressure (respectively, 124+/-1 versus 117+/-1 mm Hg and 80+/-1 versus 75+/-1 mm Hg; both P<0.001), altered markers of autonomic regulation (increased normalized low-frequency and reduced high-frequency component of RR variability, P<0.005; increased-low frequency component of systolic arterial pressure variability, P<0.002), and reduced baroreflex sensitivity (19.3+/-1.4 versus 23.0+/-2.0 ms/mm Hg; P<0.05) were observed in patients compared with controls. Autonomic responses to active standing were also blunted in stressed patients. Autonomic markers were significantly correlated to stress perception score and were capable of discriminating between controls and patients with a high degree of accuracy. Chronic real-life stress in humans appears associated to increased arterial pressure and to impaired autonomic regulation of cardiovascular functions. The combination of sympathetic predominance, vagal withdrawal, and blunted baroreflex sensitivity might represent a treatable mechanistic link between psychosocial factors and future incidence of hypertension.},

abstract = {AIMS: The purpose of this study was to identify novel genetic variants influencing circulating asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) levels and to evaluate whether they have a prognostic value on cardiovascular mortality.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a genome-wide association study on the methylarginine traits and investigated the predictive value of the new discovered variants on mortality. Our meta-analyses replicated the previously known locus for ADMA levels in DDAH1 (rs997251; P = 1.4 × 10(-40)), identified two non-synomyous polymorphisms for SDMA levels in AGXT2 (rs37369; P = 1.4 × 10(-40) and rs16899974; P = 1.5 × 10(-38)) and one in SLC25A45 (rs34400381; P = 2.5 × 10(-10)). We also fine-mapped the AGXT2 locus for further independent association signals. The two non-synonymous AGXT2 variants independently associated with SDMA levels were also significantly related with short-term heart rate variability (HRV) indices in young adults. The major allele (C) of the novel non-synonymous rs16899974 (V498L) variant associated with decreased SDMA levels and an increase in the ratio between the low- and high-frequency spectral components of HRV (P = 0.00047). Furthermore, the SDMA decreasing allele (G) of the non-synomyous SLC25A45 (R285C) variant was associated with a lower resting mean heart rate during the HRV measurements (P = 0.0046), but not with the HRV indices. None of the studied genome-wide significant variants had any major effect on cardiovascular or total mortality in patients referred for coronary angiography.

CONCLUSIONS: AGXT2 has an important role in SDMA metabolism in humans. AGXT2 may additionally have an unanticipated role in the autonomic nervous system regulation of cardiac function.},

abstract = {AIMS: To describe the relation between emotional stress and cardiovascular events, and review the literature on the cardiovascular effects of emotional stress, in order to describe the relation, the underlying pathophysiology, and potential therapeutic implications.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Targeted PUBMED searches were conducted to supplement the authors' existing database on this topic.

RESULTS: Cardiovascular events are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. Cardiovascular events can be triggered by acute mental stress caused by events such as an earthquake, a televised high-drama soccer game, job strain or the death of a loved one. Acute mental stress increases sympathetic output, impairs endothelial function and creates a hypercoagulable state. These changes have the potential to rupture vulnerable plaque and precipitate intraluminal thrombosis, resulting in myocardial infarction or sudden death.

CONCLUSION: Therapies targeting this pathway can potentially prevent acute mental stressors from initiating plaque rupture. Limited evidence suggests that appropriately timed administration of beta-blockers, statins and aspirin might reduce the incidence of triggered myocardial infarctions. Stress management and transcendental meditation warrant further study.},

MEASURES: Time domain analysis (standard deviation of beat-to-beat intervals [SDNN]) of HRV, diagnoses of mild traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and pain ratings from medical records.

RESULTS: As a group, the sample evidenced markedly depressed HRV (as reflected by SDNN) as compared with available age and gender corrected normative data. Pain (71%), PTSD (57%), and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) (64%) were prevalent. Thirty-six percent had all three measures (P3). Pain and P3 were significantly and negatively associated with SDNN (r = -0.460, P = 0.014; r = -0.373, P = 0.05, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings support the high prevalence of depressed HRV and P3 among veterans seen in a level II Polytrauma Center. The findings also suggest a possible synergistic effect of pain, PTSD, and mTBI on depressed HRV. The nature and implications of these relationships require additional research to elucidate.},

abstract = {AIM: This research was designed to study the temporal changes in cardiovascular autonomic regulation, assessed by 24-hour heart rate (HR) variability, and the possible relation of changes in HR variability to cardiovascular risk factors and progression of coronary artery disease (CAD) among type II diabetic subjects. METHOD: In a single-center substudy of The Diabetes Atherosclerosis Intervention Study (DAIS), 53 patients assigned to fenofibrate (n = 26) or placebo (n = 27), underwent time and frequency domain and fractal analysis of HR variability, coronary risk variable analyses and quantitative coronary angiograms at baseline and after three years' follow-up. RESULTS: Twenty-four hour standard deviation of sinus intervals (SDNN) decreased from 113 +/- 35 to 94 +/- 30 msec (P < 0.001) during the three year period. Low frequency power spectral component and short-term fractal scaling exponent also decreased (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). The reduction of SDNN was weakly related to a change in the triglyceride level (r = -0.33, P < 0.05), glucose level (r = -0.28, P < 0.05) and total cholesterol concentration (r = -0.35, P < 0.01). Furthermore, the reduction of SDNN was related to a decrease in the minimum lumen and mean segment diameter of the coronary arteries (r = 0.36, P < 0.01, and r = 0.39, P < 0.01, respectively). This association was more marked in the placebo group (r = 0.50, P < 0.01 and r = 0.44, P < 0.05, respectively) than among the patients randomized to fenofibrate (not significant for both). CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular autonomic regulation assessed by HR variability deteriorates rapidly in type II diabetic subjects with CAD during the time course. Impairment in HR variability is associated with changes in common coronary risk variables and with a progression of CAD.},

Within-subjects changes in these measures were assessed in 36 subjects during different postures and (paced) respiratory frequencies. Changes from supine to sitting to standing led to reduced RSA values and longer pre-ejection periods, reflecting the known decrease in vagal but not the increase of sympathetic activity. Multilevel path analysis showed that within-subjects changes in sympatho-vagal balance were faithfully reflected by changes in interbeat interval, but imperfectly by changes in RSA and pre-ejection period. It was concluded that pre-ejection period should be stratified for posture and RSA for respiratory frequency to reliably index changes in sympatho-vagal balance when these factors are prone to change (e.g., during 24-h ambulatory recording).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preliminary data suggest that the analysis of R-R interval variability by fractal analysis methods may provide clinically useful information on patients with heart failure. The purpose of this study was to compare the prognostic power of new fractal and traditional measures of R-R interval variability as predictors of death after acute myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Time and frequency domain heart rate (HR) variability measures, along with short- and long-term correlation (fractal) properties of R-R intervals (exponents alpha(1) and alpha(2)) and power-law scaling of the power spectra (exponent beta), were assessed from 24-hour Holter recordings in 446 survivors of acute myocardial infarction with a depressed left ventricular function (ejection fraction </=35%). During a mean+/-SD follow-up period of 685+/-360 days, 114 patients died (25.6%), with 75 deaths classified as arrhythmic (17.0%) and 28 as nonarrhythmic (6.3%) cardiac deaths. Several traditional and fractal measures of R-R interval variability were significant univariate predictors of all-cause mortality. Reduced short-term scaling exponent alpha(1) was the most powerful R-R interval variability measure as a predictor of all-cause mortality (alpha(1) <0.75, relative risk 3.0, 95% confidence interval 2.5 to 4.2, P<0.001). It remained an independent predictor of death (P<0.001) after adjustment for other postinfarction risk markers, such as age, ejection fraction, NYHA class, and medication. Reduced alpha(1) predicted both arrhythmic death (P<0.001) and nonarrhythmic cardiac death (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the fractal characteristics of short-term R-R interval dynamics yields more powerful prognostic information than the traditional measures of HR variability among patients with depressed left ventricular function after an acute myocardial infarction.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: QT interval parameters are potential prognostic markers of arrhythmogenicity risk and cardiovascular mortality and have never been evaluated in Chagas' disease.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Outpatients (738) in the chronic phase of Chagas' disease were enrolled in a long-term follow-up study. Maximal heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) and T-wave peak-to-end (TpTe) intervals and QRS, QT, JT, QTapex, and TpTe dispersions and variation coefficients were measured manually and calculated from 12-lead ECGs obtained on admission. Clinical, radiological, and 2-dimensional echocardiographic data were also recorded. Primary end points were all-cause, Chagas' disease-related, and sudden cardiac mortalities. During a follow-up of 58+/-39 months, 62 patients died, 54 of Chagas' disease-related causes and 40 suddenly. Multivariate Cox survival analysis revealed that the QT-interval dispersion (QTd) (hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.29 to 1.63; P<0.001, for 10-ms increments) and left ventricular (LV) end-systolic dimension (hazard ratio, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.21 to 1.53; P<0.001, for 5-mm increments) were the strongest independent predictors for all end points. The maximum QTc interval (QTcmax) could substitute for QTd with a worse predictive performance. Other predictors were heart rate, presence of pathological Q waves, frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and isolated left anterior fascicular block (LAFB) on the ECGs. Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated that a QTd > or =65 ms or a QTcmax > or =465 ms1/2 discriminated the 2 groups with significantly different prognoses.

CONCLUSIONS: Electrocardiographic QTd and echocardiographic LV end-systolic dimension were the most important mortality predictors in patients with Chagas' disease. Heart rate, the presence on ECG of pathological Q waves, frequent PVCs, and isolated LAFB refined the mortality risk stratification.},

abstract = {Suggestions were made that increased myocardial sympathetic activity is reflected by elevated QT variability (dynamic changes in QT interval duration). However, the relationship between QT variability and the amount of norepinephrine released from the cardiac sympathetic terminals is unknown. We thus attempted to assess this relationship. The study was performed in 17 subjects (12 with major depressive disorder and 5 with panic disorder). Cardiac norepinephrine spillover (measured by direct catheter technique coupled with norepinephrine isotope dilution methodology) was assessed before and 4 mo after treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. The distribution of the cardiac norepinephrine spillover was bimodal, with the majority of patients having values of < or =10 ng/min. There was a positive correlation between cardiac norepinephrine spillover and corrected QT interval (r = 0.7, P = 0.03) but not with any of the QT variability measures. However, in a subgroup of five patients who had high levels of cardiac norepinephrine spillover (>20 ng/min) a tendency for a strong positive correlation with variance of QT intervals (r = 0.9, P = 0.08) was observed. There were significant correlations between the severity of depression and QT variability indexes normalized to the heart rate [QTVi and QT interval/R-R interval (QT/RR) coherence] and between the severity of anxiety and the QT/RR residual and regression coefficient, respectively. Treatment with SSRI antidepressants substantially reduced depression score but did not affect any of the QT variability indexes. We conclude that in depression/panic disorder patients with near-normal cardiac norepinephrine levels QT variability is not correlated with cardiac norepinephrine spillover and is not affected by treatment with SSRI.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent in the general population and US veterans in particular and is associated with an increased risk of developing coronary artery disease (CAD). We compared the patient characteristics and postprocedural outcomes of veterans with and without PTSD undergoing coronary angiography.

METHODS: This is a multicenter observational study of patients who underwent coronary angiography in Veterans Affairs hospitals nationally from October 2007 to September 2011. We described patient characteristics at angiography, angiographic results, and after coronary angiography, we compared risk-adjusted 1-year rates of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), and revascularization by the presence or absence of PTSD.

RESULTS: Overall, of 116,488 patients undergoing angiography, 14,918 (12.8%) had PTSD. Compared with those without PTSD, patients with PTSD were younger (median age 61.9 vs 63.7; P < .001), had higher rates of cardiovascular risk factors, and were more likely to have had a prior MI (26.4% vs 24.7%; P < .001). Patients with PTSD were more likely to present for stable angina (22.4% vs 17.0%) or atypical chest pain (58.5% vs 48.6%) and less likely to have obstructive CAD identified at angiography (55.9% vs 62.2%; P < .001). After coronary angiography, PTSD was associated with lower unadjusted 1-year rates of MI (hazard ratio (HR), 0.86; 95% CI [0.75-1.00]; P = 0.04), revascularization (HR, 0.88; 95% CI [0.83-0.93]; P < .001), and all-cause mortality (HR, 0.66; 95% CI [0.60-0.71]; P < .001). After adjustment for cardiovascular risk, PTSD was no longer associated with 1-year rates of MI or revascularization but remained associated with lower 1-year all-cause mortality (HR, 0.91; 95% CI [0.84-0.99]; P = .03). Findings were similar after further adjustment for depression, anxiety, alcohol or substance use disorders, and frequency of outpatient follow-up.

CONCLUSIONS: Among veterans undergoing coronary angiography in the Veterans Affairs, those with PTSD were more likely to present with elective indications and less likely to have obstructive CAD. After coronary angiography, PTSD was not associated with adverse 1-year outcomes of MI, revascularization, or all-cause mortality.},

abstract = {Exposure to combat experiences is associated with increased risk of developing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Prolonged exposure therapy and cognitive processing therapy have garnered a significant amount of empirical support for PTSD treatment; however, they are not universally effective with some patients continuing to struggle with residual PTSD symptoms. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a measure of the autonomic nervous system functioning and reflects an individual's ability to adaptively cope with stress. A pilot study was undertaken to determine if veterans with PTSD (as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale and the PTSD Checklist) would show significantly different HRV prior to an intervention at baseline compared to controls; specifically, to determine whether the HRV among veterans with PTSD is more depressed than that among veterans without PTSD. The study also aimed at assessing the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of providing HRV biofeedback as a treatment for PTSD. The findings suggest that implementing an HRV biofeedback as a treatment for PTSD is effective, feasible, and acceptable for veterans. Veterans with combat-related PTSD displayed significantly depressed HRV as compared to subjects without PTSD. When the veterans with PTSD were randomly assigned to receive either HRV biofeedback plus treatment as usual (TAU) or just TAU, the results indicated that HRV biofeedback significantly increased the HRV while reducing symptoms of PTSD. However, the TAU had no significant effect on either HRV or symptom reduction. A larger randomized control trial to validate these findings appears warranted.},

Our objective was to relate a peripheral manifestation of noradrenergic function, sympathetic nervous system activity as indexed by heart rate variability during sleep, to the development of PTSD in subjects with recent traumatic injuries. METHODS: Subjects who had recall of life-threatening experiences were recruited from one of two regional trauma centers. Select subjects received a polysomnographic recording within 1 month of the trauma. Digitized electrocardiogram recordings were extracted from early and late rapid-eye-movement (REM) and preceding non-REM sleep periods. Autoregression was applied to R-R interval time series to calculate the ratios of low-frequency to high-frequency spectral densities (LF/HF ratios), which index sympathetic activation. Posttraumatic stress disorder status was determined at 2 months. RESULTS: There was a significant state x group interaction: LF/HF ratios were higher during the REM sleep of the nine subjects who were positive for PTSD symptoms, compared with the 10 subjects who were PTSD negative. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are consistent with the possibility that increased noradrenergic activity during REM sleep contributes to the development of PTSD.},

abstract = {This study examined the effects on healthy adults of a new emotional self-management program, consisting of two key techniques, "Cut-Thru" and the "Heart Lock-In." These techniques are designed to eliminate negative thought loops and promote sustained positive emotional states. The hypotheses were that training and practice in these techniques would yield lowered levels of stress and negative emotion and cortisol, while resulting in increased positive emotion and DHEA levels over a one-month period. In addition, we hypothesized that increased coherence in heart rate variability patterns would be observed during the practice of the techniques. Forty-five healthy adults participated in the study, fifteen of whom acted as a comparison group for the psychological measures. Salivary DHEA/DHEAS and cortisol levels were measured, autonomic nervous system function was assessed by heart rate variability analysis, and emotions were measured using a psychological questionnaire. Individuals in the experimental group were assessed before and four weeks after receiving training in the self-management techniques. The experimental group experienced significant increases in the positive affect scales of Caring and Vigor and significant decreases in the negative affect scales of Guilt, Hostility, Burnout, Anxiety and Stress Effects, while no significant changes were seen in the comparison group. There was a mean 23 percent reduction in cortisol and a 100 percent increase in DHEA/DHEAS in the experimental group. DHEA was significantly and positively related to the affective state Warmheartedness, whereas cortisol was significantly and positively related to Stress Effects. Increased coherence in heart rate variability patterns was measured in 80 percent of the experimental group during the use of the techniques. The results suggest that techniques designed to eliminate negative thought loops can have important positive effects on stress, emotions and key physiological systems. The implications are that relatively inexpensive interventions may dramatically and positively impact individuals' health and well-being. Thus, individuals may have greater control over their minds, bodies and health than previously suspected.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Exposure to ambient particles has been shown to be responsible for cardiovascular effects, especially in elderly with cardiovascular disease. The study assessed the association between deceleration capacity (DC) as well as heart rate variability (HRV) and ambient particulate matter (PM) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).

METHODS: A prospective study with up to 12 repeated measurements was conducted in Erfurt, Germany, between October 2000 and April 2001 in 56 patients with physician-diagnosed ischemic heart disease, stable angina pectoris or prior myocardial infarction at an age of at least 50 years. Twenty-minute ECG recordings were obtained every two weeks and 24-hour ECG recordings every four weeks. Exposure to PM (size range from 10 nm to 2.5 $\mu$m), and elemental (EC) and organic (OC) carbon was measured. Additive mixed models were used to analyze the association between PM and ECG recordings.

RESULTS: The short-term recordings showed decrements in the high-frequency component of HRV as well as in RMSSD (root-mean-square of successive differences of NN intervals) in association with increments in EC and OC 0-23 hours prior to the recordings. The long-term recordings revealed decreased RMSSD and pNN50 (% of adjacent NN intervals that differed more than 50 ms) in association with EC and OC 24-47 hours prior to the recordings. In addition, highly significant effects were found for DC which decreased in association with PM2.5, EC and OC concurrent with the ECG recordings as well as with a lag of up to 47 hours.

CONCLUSIONS: The analysis showed significant effects of ambient particulate air pollution on DC and HRV parameters reflecting parasympathetic modulation of the heart in patients with CAD. An air pollution-related decrease in parasympathetic tone as well as impaired heart rate deceleration capacity may contribute to an increased risk for cardiac morbidity and sudden cardiac death in vulnerable populations.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of the predictive value of microvolt T-wave alternans (MTWA) testing for arrhythmic events in a wide variety of populations.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies describing the use of MTWA as a predictor of ventricular tachyarrhythmic events have been limited by small sample sizes and disparate populations.

METHODS: Prospective studies of the predictive value of exercise-induced MTWA published between January 1990 and December 2004 were retrieved. Data from each article were abstracted independently by two authors using a standardized protocol. Summary estimates of the predictive value of MTWA were made using a random-effects model.

RESULTS: Data were accumulated from 19 studies (2,608 subjects) across a wide range of populations. Overall, the positive predictive value of MTWA for arrhythmic events was 19.3% at an average of 21 months' follow-up (95% confidence interval [CI] 17.7% to 21.0%), the negative predictive value was 97.2% (95% CI 96.5% to 97.9%), and the univariate relative risk of an arrhythmic event was 3.77 (95% CI 2.39 to 5.95). There was no difference in predictive value between ischemic and nonischemic heart failure subgroups. The positive predictive value varied depending on the population of patients studied (p < 0.0001).

CONCLUSIONS: Microvolt T-wave alternans testing has significant value for the prediction of ventricular tachyarrhythmic events; however, there are significant limitations to its use. The predictive value of MTWA varies significantly depending on the population studied. Careful standardization is needed for what constitutes abnormal MTWA. The incremental prognostic value of MTWA when used with other methods of risk stratification is unclear.},

abstract = {Identification of genetic factors that influence stress reactivity is important in order to link environmental demands, particularly adversity to disease outcome. There is ample literature on genetic contribution to the endocrine stress response, while evidence for genetic contribution to individual differences in autonomic nervous system function is sparse and produced conflicting results. Here, we investigated the influence of two polymorphisms in the Catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) and serotonin transporter (5-HTT; SCL6A4) gene. We examined the autonomic stress response to the Trier Social Stress Test for Children in 115 children. Salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) was obtained prior to the stressor and repeatedly during recovery as a marker of autonomic reactivity. Furthermore, heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) were monitored continuously. We found differences in ANS stress response associated with each polymorphism (all p<.05). Children with the L variant of 5-HTTLPR showed a higher increase and sharper recovery of sAA in response to stress than those with S variants. For HR, we found differences associated with COMT, i.e. children carrying at least one met allele showed lower mean HR increase and slower HR recovery in response to the stressor compared to those with two val alleles (p<.001) as well as a significant decrease in heart rate variability (p<.05). Our findings indicate that these two polymorphisms do indeed influence the ANS response to stress. This study provides further evidence for the crucial role of genetic factors in the modulation of differences in the acute stress response during childhood.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postexercise measurement of heart rate (HR) recovery and QT interval dynamics provides prognostic information in various patient populations. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess whether the measurement of the spatial relationship between the depolarization and repolarization wavefronts (total cosine R-to-T [TCRT]) during the postexercise recovery phase would yield prognostic information. METHODS: The population consisted of 1297 patients (56 +/- 13 years; 67% men) who performed a clinically indicated bicycle stress test. The exercise-recovery hysteresis of TCRT was quantified from the 12-lead exercise electrocardiogram by measuring the TCRT/HR loop area bounded by the exercise and first 3-minute postexercise recovery curves. The HR-corrected TCRT/HR hysteresis was calculated by dividing the area with the HR decrement during the first 3 minutes of recovery. HR recovery was measured at 1 minute postexercise recovery. End points were cardiac death and sudden cardiac death. RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 45 +/- 12 months, 74 patients died (5.7%); 35 (2.6%) were cardiac deaths and 24 (1.9%) were sudden cardiac deaths. Reduced TCRT/HR loop area and TCRT/HR hysteresis were associated with cardiac mortality (P <.001). After adjustments for clinical variables, including ejection fraction, TCRT/HR loop area remained an independent predictor of cardiac death (hazard ratio 5.6; 95% confidence interval 1.6-19.1; P = .007) and sudden cardiac death (10.7; 95% confidence interval 1.4-83.7; P = .024). HR recovery did not remain a significant predictor in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Attenuated hysteresis of the depolarization and repolarization wavefronts during postexercise recovery is associated with an increased risk of cardiac and sudden cardiac death. Analysis of repolarization dynamics from exercise electrocardiogram represents a promising tool for risk stratification.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) has been shown to be attenuated in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and may, therefore, be possibly used for the early detection of myocardial ischemia. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic yield of a novel short-term HRV algorithm for the detection of myocardial ischemia in subjects without known CAD. We prospectively enrolled 450 subjects without known CAD who were referred to tertiary medical centers for exercise stress testing (EST) with single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). All subjects underwent 1-hour Holter testing with subsequent HRV analysis before EST with MPI. The diagnostic yield of HRV analysis was compared with EST, using MPI as the gold standard for the noninvasive detection of myocardial ischemia. All subjects had intermediate pretest probability for CAD. Mean age was 62 years, 38% were women, 51% had hypertension, and 25% diabetes mellitus. HRV analysis showed superior sensitivity (77%) compared with standard EST (27%). After multivariate adjustment, HRV was independently associated with an 8.4-fold (p <0.001) increased likelihood for the detection of myocardial ischemia by MPI, whereas EST did not show a statistically significant association with a positive MPI (odds ratio 2.1; p = 0.12). Of subjects who were referred for subsequent coronary angiography, the respective sensitivities of HRV and EST for the detection of significant CAD were 73% versus 26%. Our data suggest that HRV can be used as an important noninvasive technique for the detection of myocardial ischemia in subjects without known CAD, providing superior sensitivity to conventional EST in this population.},

Timely prediction of VTA, using heart rate variability (HRV) analysis techniques, may facilitate the implementation of preventive and therapeutic strategies.\n\nAIM: To evaluate the novel multipole method of the HRV analysis in prediction of imminent VTAs in ICD patients.\n\nMETHODS: We screened patients from the Biotronik HAWAI Registry (Heart Rate Analysis with Automated ICDs). A total of 28 patients from the HAWAI registries (phase I and II), having medical records, who had experienced documented, verified VTA during the 2-year follow-up, were included in our analysis. HRV during preepisode recordings of 4,500 R-R intervals were analyzed using the Dyx parameter and compared to HRV of similar length recordings from the same patients that were not followed by arrhythmia.\n\nRESULTS: Our study population consisted mainly of men 25 of 28 (89%), average age of 64.8 ± 9.4 years, 92% with coronary artery disease. HRV during 64 preevent recordings (2.3 events per patient on average) was analyzed and compared with 60 control recordings. The multipole method of HRV analysis showed 50% sensitivity and 91.6% specificity for prediction of ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation in the study population, with 84.5% positive predictive value. No statistically significant correlation was found between various clinical parameters and the sensitivity of imminent VTA predetection in our patients.\n\nCONCLUSION: The multipole method of HRV analysis emerges as a highly specific, possible predictor of imminent VTA, providing an early warning allowing to prepare for an arrhythmic episode.},

abstract = {Binaural beats are an auditory illusion perceived when two or more pure tones of similar frequencies are presented dichotically through stereo headphones. Although this phenomenon is thought to facilitate state changes (e.g., relaxation), few empirical studies have reported on whether binaural beats produce changes in autonomic arousal. Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of binaural beating on autonomic dynamics [heart rate variability (HRV)] during post-exercise relaxation. Subjects (n = 21; 18-29 years old) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study during which binaural beats and placebo were administered over two randomized and counterbalanced sessions (within-subjects repeated-measures design). At the onset of each visit, subjects exercised for 20-min; post-exercise, subjects listened to either binaural beats ('wide-band' theta-frequency binaural beats) or placebo (carrier tones) for 20-min while relaxing alone in a quiet, low-light environment. Dependent variables consisted of high-frequency (HF, reflecting parasympathetic activity), low-frequency (LF, reflecting sympathetic and parasympathetic activity), and LF/HF normalized powers, as well as self-reported relaxation. As compared to the placebo visit, the binaural-beat visit resulted in greater self-reported relaxation, increased parasympathetic activation and increased sympathetic withdrawal. By the end of the 20-min relaxation period there were no observable differences in HRV between binaural-beat and placebo visits, although binaural-beat associated HRV significantly predicted subsequent reported relaxation. Findings suggest that listening to binaural beats may exert an acute influence on both LF and HF components of HRV and may increase subjective feelings of relaxation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Mental stress provokes myocardial ischemia in many patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) portends a worse prognosis, independent of standard cardiac risk factors or outcome of traditional physical stress testing. Angiotensin II plays a significant role in the physiological response to stress, but its role in MSIMI remains unknown. Our aim was to evaluate whether the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) is associated with a differential effect on the incidence of MSIMI compared with ischemia during physical stress.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 218 patients with stable CAD, including 110 on ACEI, was performed. 99m-Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging was used to define ischemia during mental stress, induced by a standardized public speaking task, and during physical stress, induced by either exercise or adenosine.

RESULTS: Overall, 40 patients (18%) developed MSIMI and 80 patients (37%) developed ischemia during physical stress. MSIMI occurred less frequently in patients receiving ACEIs (13%) compared with those not on ACEIs (24%; p = .030, adjusted odds ratio = 0.42, 95% confidence interval = 0.19-0.91). In contrast, the frequency of myocardial ischemia during physical stress testing was similar in both groups (39% versus 35% in those on and not on ACEIs, respectively); adjusted odds ratio = 0.91, 95% confidence interval = 0.48-1.73).

CONCLUSION: In this retrospective study, patients using ACEI therapy displayed less than half the risk of developing ischemia during mental stress but not physical stress. This possible beneficial effect of ACEIs on MSIMI may be contributing to their salutary effects in CAD.},

abstract = {AIMS: The aim of this study involves the early identification, among apparently healthy individuals, of those at high risk for sudden cardiac death. We tested the hypothesis that individuals who respond to mild mental stress in preparation for exercise test with the largest heart rate increases might be at highest risk.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from 7746 civil servants participating in the Paris Prospective Study I, followed-up for 23 years, allowed to compare heart rate changes between rest and mild mental stress (preparation prior to an exercise test) between subjects who suffered sudden cardiac death (n = 81), non-sudden (n = 129) coronary death, or death from any cause (n = 1306). The mean heart rate increase during mild mental stress was 8.9 +/- 10.8 b.p.m. Risk of sudden cardiac death increased progressively with heart rate increase during mental stress and the relative risk of the third vs. the first tertile was 2.09 (95% confidence interval, 1.13-3.86) after adjustment for confounders. This relationship was not observed for non-sudden coronary death.

CONCLUSION: An important heart rate increase produced by a mild mental stress predicts long-term risk for sudden cardiac death. Heart rate changes before an exercise test may provide a simple tool for risk stratification.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim was to evaluate differences in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, indexed by heart rate variability (HRV) in apparently healthy subjects with self-reported symptoms of pain (SRSP) within an exploratory analysis.

METHODS: HRV data from 14 apparently healthy male individuals were analyzed to address potential differences in subjects with and without SRSP. SRSP was assessed using the four pain-related items from the symptom checklist (SCL-90R). Subjects were stratified based on the presence of SRSP.

RESULTS: Parasympathetic activity, indexed by pNN50, RMSSD, and high frequency (HF) spectrum of HRV, was lower in subjects with SRSP. Low frequency (LF) HRV and the LF/HF ratio were greater in subjects with SRSP. However, analysis of variance revealed no significant differences between the groups. Pearson correlations showed a correlation of pNN50, HF, LF, and LF/HF ratio and the presence and frequency of SRSP. Measures of parasympathetic activity (pNN50 and HF) were inversely associated with more SRSP, indicating that subjects with more frequent SRSP show decreased parasympathetic activity.

CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with evidence on changes in HRV in patients with clinical conditions of chronic or recurrent pain, this is the first study to show that healthy individuals who report symptoms of pain may have lower parasympathetic activity revealed by measures of HRV.},

abstract = {To study the role of the sympathetic nervous system in the induction of inflammatory cytokines elicited by central lipopolysaccharide, sympathetic chemical denervation was performed by intraperitoneal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine. Rats received the neurotoxin according to the following schedule: 50 mg/kg on days 1 and 2, 100 mg/kg on days 3, 4 and 7. On day 8, lipopolysaccharide (2.5 $\mu$g/6 $\mu$l/rat) was injected intracerebroventricularly and rats were killed 2 h later. 6-Hydroxydopamine reduced noradrenaline and dopamine content in the spleen by 88.7% and 88.8%, respectively, without affecting striatal contents indicating that the chemical sympathectomy had been effective and selective. In sympathectomized rats, lipopolysaccharide raised interleukin-l$\beta$ and interleukin-6 serum levels more than in control rats given the vehicle. Tumour necrosis factor-$\alpha$ serum levels in sympathectomized rats were no different from those in vehicle-treated rats. Interleukin-1$\beta$ and interleukin-6 messenger RNA expression, measured by northern blot analysis, was clearly detectable in adrenals and spleen of rats given lipopolysaccharide. Sympathectomy increased lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-1$\beta$ and interleukin-6 messenger RNA in adrenals and spleen. Corticosterone basal levels were raised by central lipopolysaccharide and not farther changed by sympathectomy. The present study shows that sympathetic nervous system denervation enhances the synthesis and production of peripheral interleukin-l$\beta$ and interleukin-6 in rats given central lipopolysaccharide and suggests a tonic inhibitory control of the sympathetic nervous system on these inflammatory cytokines.},

abstract = {To clarify the influence of gender on sympathetic and parasympathetic control of heart rate in middle-aged subjects and on the subsequent aging process, heart rate variability (HRV) was studied in normal populations of women (n = 598) and men (n = 472) ranging in age from 40 to 79 yr. These groups were divided into eight age strata at 5-yr intervals and were clinically diagnosed as having no hypertension, hypotension, diabetic neuropathy, or cardiac arrhythmia. Frequency-domain analysis of short-term, stationary R-R intervals was performed, which reveals very-low-frequency power (VLF; 0.003-0.04 Hz), low-frequency power (LF; 0.04-0.15 Hz), high-frequency power (HF; 0.15-0.40 Hz), the ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF), and LF and HF power in normalized units (LF% and HF%, respectively). The distribution of variance, VLF, LF, HF, and LF/HF exhibited acute skewness, which was adjusted by natural logarithmic transformation. Women had higher HF in the age strata from 40 to 49 yr, whereas men had higher LF% and LF/HF between 40 and 59 yr. No disparity in HRV measurements was found between the sexes in age strata >/=60 yr. Although absolute measurements of HRV (variance, VLF, LF, and HF) decreased linearly with age, no significant change in relative measurements (LF/HF, LF%, and HF%), especially in men, was detected until age 60 yr. We conclude that middle-aged women and men have a more dominant parasympathetic and sympathetic regulation of heart rate, respectively. The gender-related difference in parasympathetic regulation diminishes after age 50 yr, whereas a significant time delay for the disappearance of sympathetic dominance occurs in men.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To clarify the relationship between depression and heart rate variability (HRV) in a sample of twins. Reduced HRV, a measure of autonomic dysfunction, has been linked to depression but many studies have inadequately controlled for familial and environmental factors. Furthermore, little is known about whether depression and HRV share common genetic pathways.

METHODS: We performed power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms in 288 middle-aged male twins. Log-normalized ultra low, very low, low, high frequency, and total power were calculated. A lifetime history of major depressive disorder (MDD) was determined, using the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders, and current depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory. Mixed-effect regression models were used to account for intrapair variability and estimate within-pair effects at the same time controlling for potential confounders.

RESULTS: Both current depressive symptoms and a history of MDD were significantly associated with lower HRV. There was a graded effect, and power in each frequency band was 29% to 36% lower in the lowest band compared with the highest BDI category. All HRV measures except high frequency remained significantly associated with current depressive symptoms in multivariable analysis, but not with lifetime history of MDD. When analyses were stratified by zygosity, a significant within-pair association between BDI score and HRV was found in the dizygotic but not in the monozygotic twins, suggesting a genetic influence on the association.

CONCLUSIONS: A shared, genetically influenced biological pathway underlies the association between depression and lower HRV. These two phenotypes may be the expression of a generalized neurobiological perturbation.},

abstract = {AIMS: The ATRAMI (Autonomic Tone and Reflexes After Myocardial Infarction) study has proved the independent prognostic value of baroreflex sensitivity. A limitation of the traditional method of estimating baroreflex sensitivity by phenylephrine, is the need to monitor intra-arterial blood pressure. Our objective was to establish whether this invasive method of monitoring could be superseded by non-invasive methods, such as the Finapres device.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with three repeated invasive and non-invasive baroreflex sensitivity measurements were selected from the ATRAMI database (n = 454). The mean of these measurements was taken as the baroreflex sensitivity estimate. The repeatability of both methods (standard deviation of the three measurements) decreased with increasing baroreflex sensitivity. There was no constant bias between invasive and non-invasive measurements (0. 22+/-2.2 ms. mmHg(-1), P = 0.42). The linear correlation was very high (r = 0.91, P < 0.01). The normalized 95% limits of agreement were -0.5 and 0.52. On survival analysis, invasive and non-invasive baroreflex sensitivity gave similar prognostic information (likelihood ratio: 155.6 (P = 0.007) and 155.0 (P = 0.006); risk ratio: 0.79 and 0.81, respectively). According to the ATRAMI cut-off points, 85% of patients were classified concordantly by the two methods. None of the patients at high (low) risk with the invasive method were classified as low (high) risk class by the non-invasive method.

CONCLUSION: Despite wide limits of agreement, invasive and non-invasive baroreflex sensitivity measurements are highly correlated and provide equivalent prognostic information.},

A resonance of AP closed-loop regulation is found to amplify LF oscillations. In dogs, the resonance gain increases slightly during baroreceptor unloading (mild hypotension obtained with nitroglycerine (NTG) i.v. infusion, n = 8) and coronary artery occlusion ((CAO), n = 6), and it is abolished by ganglionic transmission blockade ((ARF), Arfonad i.v. infusion, n = 3). In humans, this gain is considerably increased by passive tilt. Different, possibly central, sources of LF oscillations are also evaluated, finding a strong rhythmic modulation of HP during CAO. At HF, a direct respiratory arrhythmia is dominant in dogs at control, while it is considerably reduced during CAO. On the contrary, in humans, a strong influence of respiration on AP is shown which induces a reflex respiratory arrhythmia. An index of the gain of baroreceptive response, alpha cl, was decreased by NTG and CAO, and virtually abolished by chronic arterial baroreceptive denervation (TABD, n = 4) and ARF.},

abstract = {Chronic imbalance of the autonomic nervous system is a prevalent and potent risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events, including mortality. Although not widely recognized by clinicians, this risk factor is easily assessed by measures such as resting and peak exercise heart rate, heart rate recovery after exercise, and heart rate variability. Any factor that leads to inappropriate activation of the sympathetic nervous system can be expected to have an adverse effect on these measures and thus on patient outcomes, while any factor that augments vagal tone tends to improve outcomes. Insulin resistance, sympathomimetic medications, and negative psychosocial factors all have the potential to affect autonomic function adversely and thus cardiovascular prognosis. Congestive heart failure and hypertension also provide important lessons about the adverse effects of sympathetic predominance, as well as illustrate the benefits of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 2 classes of drugs that reduce adrenergic tone. Other interventions, such as exercise, improve cardiovascular outcomes partially by increasing vagal activity and attenuating sympathetic hyperactivity.},

abstract = {Identifying emotions in people with severe and profound intellectual disabilities is a difficult challenge. Since self-reports are not available, behaviour is the most used source of information. Given the limitations and caveats associated with using behaviour as the sole source of information about their emotions, it is important to supplement behavioural information with information from another source. As it is accepted that emotions consist of language, behaviour and physiology, in this article we investigated if physiology could give information about the emotions of people with severe and profound intellectual disabilities. To this aim we tested hypotheses derived from the motivational model of Bradley, Codispoti, Cuthbert, and Lang (2001) about the relation between heart rate and the valence of emotions and between heart rate, skin conductance and skin temperature and behavioural expressions of emotions of people with severe and profound intellectual disability. We presented 27 participants with 4 staff-selected negative and 4 staff-selected positive stimuli. The situations were videotaped and their heart rate, skin conductance and skin temperature was measured. Each behaviour of the participant was coded using the observational method developed by Petry and Maes (2006). As hypothesized, we found a lower heart rate when participants were presented with negative stimuli than when they were presented with positive stimuli in the first 6s of stimuli presentation. Their skin temperature was higher for the expression of low intensity negative emotions compared to the expression of low intensity positive emotions. The results suggest that, as with people without disability, heart rate and skin temperature can give information about the emotions of persons with severe and profound ID.},

We analyzed trajectories of heart rate variability (HRV) 1 h before and after ischemic events, and we examined the role of exercise and mental stress in preischemic autonomic changes. METHODS: Male patients with stable coronary artery disease (n = 19; 62.1 +/- 9.3 years) underwent 48-h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Frequency domain HRV measures were assessed for 60 min before and after each of 68 ischemic events and during nonischemic heart rate-matched control periods. RESULTS: High-frequency HRV decreased from -60, -20 to -10 min before ischemic events (4.8 +/- 1.3; 4.6 +/- 1.3; 4.4 +/- 1.2 ln [ms(2)], respectively; p = 0.04) and further from -4, -2 min, until ischemia (4.4 +/- 1.3; 4.1 +/- 1.3; 3.7 +/- 1.2 ln [ms(2)]; p's < 0.01). Low frequency HRV decreases started at -4 min (p < 0.05). Ischemic events occurring at high mental activities were preceded by depressed high frequency HRV levels compared with events at low mental activity (p = 0.038 at -4 min, p = 0.045 at -2 min), whereas the effects of mental activities were not observed during nonischemic control periods. Heart rate variability measures remained significantly decreased for 20 min after recovery of ST-segment depression when events were triggered by high activity levels. CONCLUSIONS: Autonomic changes consistent with vagal withdrawal can act as a precipitating factor for daily life ischemia, particularly in episodes triggered by mental activities.},

abstract = {Hormone replacement therapy is universally associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) in observational studies, but it is unknown whether this association is mediated by the autonomic nervous system. We tested the hypothesis that postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy was associated with more favorable heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) in a population sample of women (n=2,621). Hormone therapy use was measured at four examinations beginning in 1987. Supine HR and HRV indices were measured for 6 minutes at the final examination (1996-1998). In unadjusted linear regression models, hormone therapy was associated with lower HR (hormone use=64.7 vs. never=65.7 beats/min, P=.01) and higher HRV. However, following adjustment for age and CHD risk factors, both associations were eliminated. Results from this observational study suggest that hormone therapy is not associated with HR or HRV. These analyses should be replicated in a randomized trial.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Experimental evidence suggests that autonomic markers such as heart-rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) may contribute to postinfarction risk stratification. There are clinical data to support this concept for heart-rate variability. The main objective of the ATRAMI study was to provide prospective data on the additional and independent prognostic value for cardiac mortality of heart-rate variability and BRS in patients after myocardial infarction in whom left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and ventricular arrhythmias were known. METHODS: This multicentre international prospective study enrolled 1284 patients with a recent (<28 days) myocardial infarction. 24 h Holter recording was done to quantify heart-rate variability (measured as standard deviation of normal to normal RR intervals [SDNN]) and ventricular arrhythmias. BRS was calculated from measurement of the rate-pressure response to intravenous phenylephrine. FINDINGS: During 21 (SD 8) months of follow-up, the primary endpoint, cardiac mortality, included 44 cardiac deaths and five non-fatal cardiac arrests. Low values of either heart-rate variability (SDNN <70 ms) or BRS (<3.0 ms per mm Hg) carried a significant multivariate risk of cardiac mortality (3.2 [95% CI 1.42-7.36] and 2.8 [1.24-6.16], respectively). The association of low SDNN and BRS further increased risk; the 2-year mortality was 17% when both were below the cut-offs and 2% (p<0.0001) when both were well preserved (SDNN >105 ms, BRS >6.1 ms per mm Hg). The association of low SDNN or BRS with LVEF below 35% carried a relative risk of 6.7 (3.1-14.6) or 8.7 (4.3-17.6), respectively, compared with patients with LVEF above 35% and less compromised SDNN (> or = 70 ms) and BRS (> or = 3 ms per mm Hg). INTERPRETATION: ATRAMI provides clinical evidence that after myocardial infarction the analysis of vagal reflexes has significant prognostic value independently of LVEF and of ventricular arrhythmias and that it significantly adds to the prognostic value of heart-rate variability.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. The serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) is a key candidate gene for depression. We examined the association between SLC6A4 promoter methylation variation and depressive symptoms using 84 monozygotic twin pairs.

METHODS: DNA methylation level in the SLC6A4 promoter region was quantified by bisulfite pyrosequencing using genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes. The number of current depressive symptoms was assessed using the Beck Depressive Inventory II (BDI-II). The association between methylation variation and depressive symptoms was examined using matched twin-pair analyses, adjusting for body mass index, smoking, physical activity, and alcohol consumption. Multiple testing was controlled by adjusted false discovery rate (q value).

RESULTS: Intrapair difference in DNA methylation variation at 10 of the 20 studied CpG sites is significantly correlated with intrapair difference in BDI scores. Linear regression using intrapair differences demonstrates that intrapair difference in BDI score was significantly associated with intrapair differences in DNA methylation variation after adjusting for potential confounders and correction for multiple testing. On average, a 10% increase in the difference in mean DNA methylation level was associated with 4.4 increase in the difference in BDI score (95% confidence interval = 0.9-7.9, p = .01).

CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that variation in methylation level within the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene is associated with variation in depressive symptoms in a large sample of monozygotic twin pairs. This relationship is not confounded by genetic and shared environment. The 5-HTTLPR genotype also does not modulate this association.},

abstract = {According to classical concepts of physiologic control, healthy systems are self-regulated to reduce variability and maintain physiologic constancy. Contrary to the predictions of homeostasis, however, the output of a wide variety of systems, such as the normal human heartbeat, fluctuates in a complex manner, even under resting conditions. Scaling techniques adapted from statistical physics reveal the presence of long-range, power-law correlations, as part of multifractal cascades operating over a wide range of time scales. These scaling properties suggest that the nonlinear regulatory systems are operating far from equilibrium, and that maintaining constancy is not the goal of physiologic control. In contrast, for subjects at high risk of sudden death (including those with heart failure), fractal organization, along with certain nonlinear interactions, breaks down. Application of fractal analysis may provide new approaches to assessing cardiac risk and forecasting sudden cardiac death, as well as to monitoring the aging process. Similar approaches show promise in assessing other regulatory systems, such as human gait control in health and disease. Elucidating the fractal and nonlinear mechanisms involved in physiologic control and complex signaling networks is emerging as a major challenge in the postgenomic era.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between polymorphic variation in alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor genes and cardiovascular activity at rest and in response to psychological challenge in a sample in which the heritability of these cardiovascular phenotypes may be established. METHODS: Several common polymorphisms were characterized within ADRA1B (alpha1B), ADRA2A (alpha2A), ADRB1 (beta1) and ADRB2 (beta2) and examined in relation to heart rate (HR) and systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, both at rest and in response to stress. Participants were 309 European-American, young adult men and women (including 101 monozygotic and 44 dizygotic twin pairs). RESULTS: In the full sample, participants carrying any G allele at base pair (bp) 1165 in ADRB1 exhibited elevated resting SBP and DBP and a larger DBP response to mental challenge compared to homozygotes for the C allele (P < 0.04). An AA genotype at bp 145 in ADRB1 was also associated with higher resting SBP and DBP than AG or GG genotypes (P < 0.03). At bp 46 in ADRB2, GG homozygotes had higher resting DBP than subjects possessing any A allele (P < 0.05). For the same polymorphism, however, AG heterozygotes showed lower SBP than both AA and GG homozygotes (P < 0.05). In a subsample of genetically unrelated individuals, ADRB1 (1165) continued to predict resting SBP, DBP and DBP response to stress (P < 0.03), while ADRB2 (46) was associated with resting SBP (P < 0.04) but not DBP. Finally, the degree of allele sharing at ADRB1 (1165) also predicted variability in SBP and DBP at rest among dizygotic twin pairs (P < 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that some polymorphic variation within adrenoreceptor genes contributes to interindividual variability in resting SBP and DBP and in DBP response to mental challenge.},

@article{Lampert2010,
abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although anecdotal evidence has long suggested links between emotion and ventricular arrhythmia, more recent studies have prospectively demonstrated the arrhythmogenic effects of anger, as well as mechanisms underlying these effects. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological studies reveal that psychological stress increases sudden death, as well as arrhythmias, in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, in populations during emotionally devastating disasters such as earthquake or war. Diary-based studies confirm that anger and other negative emotions can trigger potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Anger alters electrophysiological properties of the myocardium, including T-wave alternans, a measure of heterogeneity of repolarization, suggesting one mechanistic link between emotion and arrhythmia. Pilot studies of behavioral interventions have shown promise in decreasing arrhythmias in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators. SUMMARY: Anger and other strong emotions can trigger polymorphic, potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in vulnerable patients. Through autonomic changes including increased sympathetic activity and vagal withdrawal, anger leads to increases in heterogeneity of repolarization as measured by T-wave alternans, known to be associated with arrhythmogenesis, as well as increasing inducibility of arrhythmia. Further delineation of mechanisms linking anger and arrhythmia, and of approaches to decrease the detrimental effects of anger and other negative emotions on arrhythmogenesis, are important areas of future investigation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart rate variability (HRV) measures homeostatic regulation of the autonomic nervous system in response to perturbation and has been previously shown to quantify risk for cardiac events. Despite known interactions among stress vulnerability, psychiatric illness, and cardiac health, however, this is the first study to our knowledge to compare directly the value of laboratory HRV in predicting autonomic modulation of real-world emotional stress. METHODS: We recorded electrocardiograms (ECG) on 56 subjects: first, within the laboratory and then during an acute emotional stressor: a first-time skydive. Laboratory sessions included two 5-min ECG recordings separated by one ambulatory 24-hour recording. To test the efficacy of introducing a mild emotional challenge, during each of the 5-min laboratory recordings, subjects viewed either aversive or benign images. Following the laboratory session, subjects participated in the acute stressor wearing a Holter ECG. Artifact-free ECGs (n = 33) were analyzed for HRV then statistically compared across laboratory and acute stress sessions. RESULTS: There were robust correlations (r = .7-.8) between the laboratory and acute stress HRV, indicating that the two most useful paradigms (long-term wake, followed by short-term challenge) were also most sensitive to distinct components of the acute stressor: the former correlated with the fine-tuned regulatory modulation occurring immediately prior and following the acute stressor, whereas the latter correlated with gross amplitude and recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed the efficacy of laboratory-acquired HRV in predicting autonomic response to acute emotional stress and suggest that ambulatory and challenge protocols enhance predictive value.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine if cardiorespiratory biofeedback increases heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with documented coronary artery disease (CAD). BACKGROUND: Diminished HRV has been associated with increased cardiac morbidity and mortality. Evidence suggests that various lifestyle changes and pharmacologic therapies can improve HRV. The objective of this study was to determine if biofeedback increases HRV in patients with CAD. METHODS: Patients with established CAD (n = 63; mean age, 67 years) were randomly assigned to conventional therapy or to 6 biofeedback sessions consisting of abdominal breath training, heart and respiratory physiologic feedback, and daily breathing practice. HRV was measured by the standard deviation of normal-to-normal QRS complexes (SDNN) at week 1 (pretreatment), week 6 (after treatment), and week 18 (follow-up). RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar for the treatment and control groups. The SDNN for the biofeedback and control groups did not differ at baseline or at week 6 but were significantly different at week 18. The biofeedback group showed a significant increase in SDNN from baseline to week 6 (P <.001) and to week 18 (P =.003). The control subjects had no change from baseline to week 6 (P =.214) and week 18 (P =.27). CONCLUSIONS: Biofeedback increases HRV in patients with CAD and therefore may be an integral tool for improving cardiac morbidity and mortality rates.},

The aim of this study was to investigate associations of cardiac sympathetic dysinnervation (CSD; by (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy) with short-term heart rate variability (HRV) measured by traditional vs. complexity markers. ECG was measured in 31 diabetic patients during rest over a period of 5 minutes and HRV quantified in different domains (time and frequency domain, scaling properties, symbolic dynamics). (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy identified 16 patients with CSD. Resting heart rate was increased and HRV reduced in these patients. In a subgroup of 16 patients ECG was also measured during standing. Changes in several HRV measures upon standing demonstrated cardiac responsiveness to orthostatic stress. Strong correlations between HRV, measured during standing, and CSD were observed with metrics based on symbolic dynamics. In conclusion, HRV assessment during standing may be useful for assessing cardiac sympathetic dysinnervation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.},

abstract = {Standard heart rate variability (HRV) techniques have been questioned in the sleep and autonomic fields as imprecise measures of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. A new technique has emerged, known as phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA). PRSA is used to quantify the quasi-periodic accelerations and decelerations in short-term heart rate, an effect that is normally masked by artifacts and noise. When applied to a signal of peak-to-peak (RR) time intervals, these quasiperiodicities can be used to estimate overall vagal activity, quantified as deceleration capacity (DC) and acceleration capacity (AC). We applied the PRSA analysis to a healthy cohort (ages 21-60 yr) enrolled in a clinical sleep trial, in which ECG data during wakefulness and sleep were available. We found that DC and AC were significantly attenuated with increasing age: a 0.27 ms/yr decrease in DC and a 0.29 ms/yr increase in AC (P<0.001). However, even in the older subjects, DC values were higher then previously found in people post-myocardial infarction. We also found a drop in percentage of normal-to-normal intervals where the current interval deviated>50 ms from the previous interval with age, with a decrease of 0.84%/yr. We did not find any differences between younger and older subjects with traditional HRV techniques, such as low-frequency or high-frequency power. Overall, the study provides normative PRSA data and suggests that PRSA is more sensitive than other HRV measurements. We propose that the decrease in DC and AC may be a sensitive marker for autonomic changes with aging. Further work will be required to determine whether the observed changes predict poorer cardiac health prognosis.},

abstract = {Abnormal serotonin transporter (5-HTT) function and autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation has been proposed in panic disorder. However, in contrast to hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) functioning, ANS reactivity during panic response has yet not been investigated in humans with respect to the 5-HTT genotype. The present study assessed the influence of challenging by cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) on heart rate variability (HRV) measures, to monitor autonomic reactivity and its relationship to 5-HTT-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) genotypes. We hypothesized substantial effects of the 5-HTTLPR genotype on autonomic reactivity. We studied 30 healthy young men, 15 of each with the long/long (l/l) or short/short (s/s) genotype for the 5-HTTLPR. All participants received an intravenous application of 50 mug CCK-4. HRV measures were assessed in both groups at baseline and immediately after CCK-4 application. Our results indicated lower parasympathetic activity in s/s carriers during baseline, time and frequency domain measures. CCK-4 application significantly enhanced the sympathetic tone in both groups, leading to diminished group differences. A significant treatment by genotype effect indicated reduced autonomic reactivity to CCK-4 challenge in the s/s compared to l/l carriers. Our findings show enhanced sympathetic and/or diminished cardiac vagal activity under basal conditions and blunted autonomic reactivity in s/s vs. l/l carriers. Our study provides novel data supporting claims that the s/s genotype represents a genetic vulnerability factor associated with inadequate hyporeactivity to stress and extends current knowledge on the impact of the central serotonergic activity on the sympathoadrenal pathway.},

To assess the importance of genetic factors, a meta-analysis was performed on all published twin studies that assessed heart rate (HR) or blood pressure (BP) reactivity to the cold pressor test or various mental stress tasks. For reactivity to mental stress, the pooled heritability estimate ranged from 0.26 to 0.43. Reactivity to the cold pressor test yielded heritability estimates from 0.21 to 0.55. An ensuing review of genetic association studies revealed a number of genes, mostly within the sympathoadrenal pathway, that may account for part of the heritability of cardiovascular stress reactivity. Future progress in gene finding, that should include measures of sympathetic and vagal stress reactivity, may help uncover the molecular pathways from genetic variation to stress reactivity.},

We evaluated the utility of electrocardiogram (ECG)-based cardiopulmonary coupling analysis to quantify physiologic sleep stability in patients with major depression. Relative to controls, unmedicated depressed patients had a reduction in high-frequency coupling, an index of stable sleep, an increase in low-frequency coupling, an index of unstable sleep, and an increase in very-low-frequency coupling, an index of wakefulness/REM sleep. The medicated depressed group showed a restoration of stable sleep to a level comparable with that of the control group. ECG-based cardiopulmonary coupling analysis may provide a simple, cost-efficient point-of-care method to quantify sleep quality/stability and to objectively evaluate the severity of insomnia in patients with major depression.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Information is limited about the independent prognostic value of repolarization abnormalities in women.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated hazard ratios for ECG variables for combined fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease (CHD) events and for CHD mortality using Cox regression in 38,283 Women's Health Initiative (WHI) participants during up to 9.2 years of follow-up. All risk models were adjusted for demographic, clinical, and therapeutic variables. Evaluated as single ECG variables, wide QRS/T angle and ECG-demonstrated myocardial infarction (ECG-MI) were the strongest predictors of CHD events, with hazard ratios (95% CI) of 1.90 (1.50 to 2.42) and 1.62 (1.29 to 2.03), respectively. Six other repolarization variables were also significant, strong predictors of CHD events. Wide QRS/T angle, ECG-MI, and QT prolongation appeared as dominant predictors when evaluated simultaneously with other ECG variables in a multiadjusted risk model. QRS/T angle, ECG-MI, and high QRS nondipolar voltage were the strongest predictors of CHD mortality, with hazard ratios of 2.70, 2.41, and 2.18, respectively. The risk increase ranged from 63% to 95% for the other 4 significant predictors. Five ECG abnormalities were identified as dominant mortality risk predictors: wide QRS/T angle, ECG-MI, high QRS nondipolar voltage, reduced heart rate variability, and QT prolongation (in the cardiovascular disease-free group only).

CONCLUSIONS: Ventricular repolarization abnormalities in postmenopausal women are as important predictors of CHD events and CHD mortality as ECG-MI and other QRS abnormalities. Repolarization variables and QRS nondipolar voltage warrant attention in future investigations.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether interindividual variation in parasympathetic (cholinergic) and sympathetic (adrenergic) regulation of heart rate (as estimated by frequency components of heart rate variability [HRV]) may be accounted for, in part, by genetic variation in the choline transporter, a component of acetylcholine neurotransmission. METHODS: Resting HRV estimates of high- (HF) and low-frequency (LF) power and LF/HF ratio were determined from electrocardiogram recordings collected continuously over 5 minutes in 413 white individuals of European ancestry (49% men; aged 30-54 years [mean, 44 years]). Subjects were genotyped for a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the 3' untranslated region of the choline transporter gene (CHT1). Frequencies of the alternate CHT1 alleles, labeled G and T, were 76% and 24%. RESULTS: Compared with GG homozygotes, participants having any T allele had greater HF power (p <.02), lower LF power (p <.02), and lower LF/HF ratios (p <.005). Relative to men, women had lower LF power (p <.001) and lower LF/HF ratios (p <.005). CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that polymorphic variation in the CHT1 gene is associated significantly with interindividual variability in HRV indices related to parasympathetic (cholinergic) activity.},

abstract = {Unmanaged emotional reactions to stress not only lead to behavior problems in young people but also create physiological conditions that inhibit learning and potentially increase the risk of disease later in life. For these reasons, the integration of emotional self-management skills training programs has become an increased priority in some schools. In this study, middle school students enrolled in a course in emotional competence skills learned techniques designed to intercept stressful responses during emotionally challenging situations. Behavioral outcomes were assessed using the Achievement Inventory Measure and autonomic function was measured by heart rate variability (HRV) analysis during and after a stressful interview. Following the program, students exhibited significant improvements in areas including stress and anger management, risky behavior, work management and focus, and relationships with family, peers and teachers. These improvements were sustained over the following six months. Students using the skills taught in the course to recover from acute emotional stress were also able to positively modulate their physiological stress responses. As compared to a control group, trained students demonstrated significantly increased HRV and more rhythmic, sine wave-like heart rhythm patterns during recovery. This response pattern reflects increased parasympathetic activity, heart rhythm coherence, and entrainment of other biological oscillatory systems to the primary heart rhythm frequency. Increased physiological coherence is associated with improved cognitive performance, emotional balance, mental clarity and health outcomes. These physiological shifts could promote the sustained psychological and behavioral improvements associated with the use of emotional management skills. It is suggested that learning emotional competence skills in childhood establishes healthier physiological response patterns which can benefit learning and long-term health. Results provide support for the integration in school curricula of courses designed to teach effective self-management skills to children.},

abstract = {Whether autonomic dysfunction predates the development of symptomatic heart failure (HF) or is simply a consequence of severe HF is unknown. We hypothesized that reduced heart rate variability (a marker of abnormal autonomic function) at baseline is associated with incident HF in subjects free of clinically recognized cardiovascular disease. In the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a population-based study of subclinical cardiovascular disease in adults aged 45 to 84 years, we measured the heart rate variability using a standard 30-second, 12-lead electrocardiogram to measure the standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences in RR intervals (RMSSD). During a median follow-up of 7.6 years, 95 participants developed HF (incidence rate 2.7/1,000 person-years). After adjusting for age, gender, and ethnicity, the hazard ratio for incident HF stratified by the RMSSD tertile was 2.4 (95% confidence interval 1.4 to 4.2) for the lowest tertile and 1.7 (95% confidence interval 1.0 to 3.2) for the middle tertile (highest tertile was the referent group; p for trend <0.001). The inverse association between the RMSSD and incident HF persisted after adjustment for additional covariates, including diabetes, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, subclinical atherosclerosis, left ventricular end-systolic volume, interim myocardial infarction, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (p for trend = 0.009). A similarly significant inverse association was also observed for SDNN. In conclusion, baseline autonomic dysfunction was a risk factor for the development of HF in a multiethnic cohort. These population-based findings implicate autonomic dysfunction in the pathogenesis of HF, and decreased short-term heart rate variability might be a novel form of stage B (asymptomatic) HF.},

Religious and spiritual associations are common but are not requisite for meditation practice and it should be recognized that the basis of many if not all practices is the training of the brain and body, a process that appears to have profound effects on both structure and function. In recent decades there has been interest regarding the effects of these ancient practices on the cardiovascular system, as meditation has intuitive appeal for benefit in this area. Though there is a relative shortage of quality data, available evidence suggests that meditation may exert beneficial effects on autonomic tone, autonomic reflexes, and decrease blood pressure acutely and after long term practice. In addition, meditation has the potential to positively influence the cardiovascular system through the mind-heart connection and the anti-inflammatory reflex. There is limited but promising data to suggest that meditation based interventions can have beneficial effects on patients with established cardiovascular disease. More high quality and unbiased studies of meditation practices on relevant endpoints in cardiovascular disease are needed, including the effects of such practices on inflammation, baseline heart rate variability, arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and panic disorder (PD) are two anxiety disorders with prominent psychophysiological symptoms. The PTSD criterion of persistent hyperarousal suggests autonomic dysregulation, and the disorder has been associated with elevated heart rate. In contrast, PD has been associated with respiratory abnormalities such as low end-tidal Pco(2). An integrated analysis of automatic and respiratory function in a direct comparison of these anxiety disorders is currently lacking. METHODS: Electrodermal, cardiovascular, and respiratory psychophysiology was examined in 23 PTSD patients, 26 PD patients, and 32 healthy individuals at baseline and during threat of shock. RESULTS: At baseline, the PTSD patients, in contrast to the other two groups, were characterized by attenuated parasympathetic and elevated sympathetic control, as evidenced by low respiratory sinus arrhythmia (a measure of cardiac vagal control) and high electrodermal activity. They also displayed elevated heart rate and cardiovascular sympathetic activation in comparison with healthy controls. PD patients exhibited lower Pco(2) (hypocapnia) and higher cardiovascular sympathetic activation compared with healthy controls. PTSD patients, but not PD patients, sighed more frequently than controls. During the threat of shock phase, the PTSD group demonstrated blunted electrodermal responses. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent hyperarousal symptoms in PTSD seem to be due to high sympathetic activity coupled with low parasympathetic cardiac control. Respiratory abnormalities were also present in PTSD. Several psychophysiological measures exhibited group-comparison effect sizes in the order of 1.0, supporting their potential for enhancing differential diagnosis and possibly suggesting utility as endophenotypes in genetic studies of anxiety disorders.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Our previous work has shown genetic variation in the human choline transporter gene (CHT1) to be associated with depressive symptoms and autonomic cardiac (cholinergic) dysregulation. Here, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine the relation between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in CHT1 on regional brain reactivity relevant to autonomic (cholinergic) function. METHODS: Thirty-two participants of European ancestry (18 men, 14 women; age: 33-54 years) completed an fMRI protocol using corticolimbic reactivity and prefrontal inhibitory control paradigms. Resting cholinergic function, as measured by heart rate variability (HRV), was quantified from electrocardiogram. Subjects were genotyped for a CHT1 G/T SNP. RESULTS: GG homozygotes had greater right (R) dorsal amygdala (p < .008), bilateral anterior cingulate (p < .009), and R caudate reactivity (p < .015) than T-allele carriers. Heart rate variability was related to R frontal cortex (Brodmann Areas 6, 9, and 46), R hippocampal formation, bilateral caudate, and bilateral anterior cingulate reactivity (p's < .007). CONCLUSIONS: CHT1 variation is related to differences in a distributed corticolimbic circuitry mediating behavioral and physiologic arousal. These relations may contribute to a biological mechanism by which genetic variation in cholinergic neurotransmission affects cognition, mood, and autonomic cardiac function.},

abstract = {The association of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with cardiovascular disease risk may be mediated by inflammation. Our objective was to examine the association between PTSD and measures of inflammation and to determine whether these associations are due to shared familial or genetic factors. We measured lifetime history of PTSD using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV in 238 male middle-aged military veteran twin pairs (476 individuals), selected from the Vietnam Era Twins Registry, who were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline. We assessed inflammation using levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), fibrinogen, white blood cells, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Geometric mean levels and percent differences by PTSD were obtained from mixed-model linear regression analyses with adjustment for potential confounders. Within-pair analysis was conducted to adjust for shared family environment and genetics (monozygotic pairs). Overall, 12.4% of participants had a lifetime history of PTSD. Adjusted mean levels of hsCRP and ICAM-1 were significantly higher among those with vs. without PTSD [hsCRP: 1.75 vs. 1.31mg/l (33% difference); ICAM-1: 319 vs. 293ng/ml (9% difference)]. Adjustment for depression rendered the association of PTSD with hsCRP non-statistically significant. For IL-6, no consistent association was seen. Within-pair analysis produced associations that were similar in direction for all three markers but lesser in magnitude for hsCRP and IL-6. There was no evidence of interaction by zygosity. Elevated hsCRP and ICAM-1 are associated with PTSD, and these associations may be confounded by shared non-genetic, antecedent familial and environmental factors.},

abstract = {AIMS: To investigate the prognostic value of autonomic variables in patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure (HF) treated according to current recommendations.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed 24 h time-domain [standard deviation of all normal-to-normal RR intervals (SDNN)], frequency-domain [very low frequency and low frequency power (VFLP and LFP)], and non-linear [detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA)] heart rate variability, deceleration capacity (DC), and heart rate turbulence (HRT) in 388 sinus rhythm HF patients enrolled in the GISSI-HF Holter substudy [82% males, age 65 ±10 years, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III-IV 20%, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 33 ±8%]. Cardiovascular (CV) mortality and combined sudden death + implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) discharge were assessed as a function of continuous variables in the entire population and in patients with LVEF >30% in univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. After a median of 47 months, 57 patients died of CV causes and 47 experienced the arrhythmic endpoint. For CV mortality, VLFP, LFP, and turbulence slope (TS) improved predictive discrimination (c-index) and risk classification [integrated discrimination improvement (IDI)] when added to clinical variables [age ≥70 years, LVEF, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), serum creatinine], while for arrhythmic mortality although the c-index increased in all three autonomic markers, the results of the IDI were statistically significant only for TS when added to NSVT, serum creatinine, and ischaemic aetiology. In 194 patients with LVEF >30% (20 arrhythmic events), the hazard ratio of an impaired TS (<2.5 msper RR interval) was 3.81 (95% confidence interval 1.35-10.7,P = 0.012) after adjustment for serum creatinine.

CONCLUSIONS: Autonomic indexes still have independent predictive value on long-term outcome in HF patients. HRT may help in identifying patients with LVEF >30% at increased arrhythmic risk. Trial registration NCT00336336.},

abstract = {Inflammation is a risk factor for both depression and cardiovascular disease. Depressed mood is also a cardiovascular risk factor. To date, research into mechanisms through which inflammation impacts cardiovascular health rarely takes into account central effects on autonomic cardiovascular control, instead emphasizing direct effects of peripheral inflammatory responses on endothelial reactivity and myocardial function. However, brain responses to inflammation engage neural systems for motivational and homeostatic control and are expressed through depressed mood state and changes in autonomic cardiovascular regulation. Here we combined an inflammatory challenge, known to evoke an acute reduction in mood, with neuroimaging to identify the functional brain substrates underlying potentially detrimental changes in autonomic cardiovascular control. We first demonstrated that alterations in the balance of low to high frequency (LF/HF) changes in heart rate variability (a measure of baroreflex sensitivity) could account for some of the inflammation-evoked changes in diastolic blood pressure, indicating a central (rather than solely local endothelial) origin. Accompanying alterations in regional brain metabolism (measured using (18)FDG-PET) were analysed to localise central mechanisms of inflammation-induced changes in cardiovascular state: three discrete regions previously implicated in stressor-evoked blood pressure reactivity, the dorsal anterior and posterior cingulate and pons, strongly mediated the relationship between inflammation and blood pressure. Moreover, activity changes within each region predicted the inflammation-induced shift in LF/HF balance. These data are consistent with a centrally-driven component originating within brain areas supporting stressor evoked blood pressure reactivity. Together our findings highlight mechanisms binding psychological and physiological well-being and their perturbation by peripheral inflammation.},

abstract = {The methods used to assess cardiac parasympathetic (cardiovagal) activity and its effects on the heart in both humans and animal models are reviewed. Heart rate (HR)-based methods include measurements of the HR response to blockade of muscarinic cholinergic receptors (parasympathetic tone), beat-to-beat HR variability (HRV) (parasympathetic modulation), rate of post-exercise HR recovery (parasympathetic reactivation), and reflex-mediated changes in HR evoked by activation or inhibition of sensory (afferent) nerves. Sources of excitatory afferent input that increase cardiovagal activity and decrease HR include baroreceptors, chemoreceptors, trigeminal receptors, and subsets of cardiopulmonary receptors with vagal afferents. Sources of inhibitory afferent input include pulmonary stretch receptors with vagal afferents and subsets of visceral and somatic receptors with spinal afferents. The different methods used to assess cardiovagal control of the heart engage different mechanisms, and therefore provide unique and complementary insights into underlying physiology and pathophysiology. In addition, techniques for direct recording of cardiovagal nerve activity in animals; the use of decerebrate and in vitro preparations that avoid confounding effects of anesthesia; cardiovagal control of cardiac conduction, contractility, and refractoriness; and noncholinergic mechanisms are described. Advantages and limitations of the various methods are addressed, and future directions are proposed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We determined the contribution of multiple variables to predict arrhythmic death and total mortality risk in patients with coronary disease and left ventricular dysfunction. We then constructed an algorithm to predict risk of mortality and sudden death. BACKGROUND: Many factors in addition to ejection fraction (EF) influence the prognosis of patients with coronary disease. However, there are few tools to use this information to guide clinical decisions. METHODS: We evaluated the relationship between 25 variables and total mortality and arrhythmic death in 674 patients enrolled in the MUSTT (Multicenter Unsustained Tachycardia Trial) study that did not receive antiarrhythmic therapy. We then constructed risk-stratification algorithms to weight the prognostic impact of each variable on arrhythmic death and total mortality risk. RESULTS: The variables having the greatest prognostic impact in multivariable analysis were functional class, history of heart failure, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia not related to bypass surgery, EF, age, left ventricular conduction abnormalities, inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia, enrollment as an inpatient, and atrial fibrillation. The model demonstrates that patients whose only risk factor is EF < or =30% have a predicted 2-year arrhythmic death risk <5%. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple variables influence arrhythmic death and total mortality risk. Patients with EF < or =30% but no other risk factor have low predicted mortality risk. Patients with EF >30% and other risk factors may have higher mortality and a higher risk of sudden death than some patients with EF < or =30%. Thus, risk of sudden death in patients with coronary disease depends on multiple variables in addition to EF.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between depressed mood and parasympathetic control of the heart in healthy men and women at rest and during two stressors. METHODS: Fifty-three healthy college students completed a laboratory stress protocol that included a baseline resting period, a challenging speech task, and a forehead cold pressor task. Depressed mood was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Parasympathetic cardiac control was measured as the high-frequency (0.12-0.40 Hz) component (HF) of heart rate variability using power spectrum analysis. Blood pressure, respiration rate, and respiration amplitude were measured simultaneously. RESULTS: Participants were categorized as having a high or low depressed mood on the basis of median splits of their BDI scores. Those in the high depressed mood group had significantly greater reductions in HF during the speech task and significantly smaller increases in HF during the forehead cold pressor task than those in the low depressed mood group. Women had significantly greater reductions in HF during the speech task and smaller increases in HF during the forehead cold pressor task than men. However, gender and depressed mood did not interact to predict changes in HF. CONCLUSIONS: Depressed mood is related to the magnitude of decrease in parasympathetic cardiac control during stressors in healthy men and women. These findings extend those of previous studies, in which a similar phenomenon was observed among patients with cardiac disease. Because the participants in this study were healthy, the relationship between depressed mood and parasympathetic cardiac control does not seem to be secondary to cardiovascular disease.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that indexes describing heart rate (HR) dynamics may predict subsequent deaths of patients after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Because beta-blocking (BB) drugs affect both mortality and HR dynamics, the prognostic power of measurements of HR dynamics may have changed in the current era of BB therapy. This study assessed the temporal changes and prognostic significance of time-domain, spectral, and fractal indexes of HR variability along with HR turbulence after an AMI among patients with optimized BB medication. SD of NN intervals, spectral indexes, the short-term fractal scaling exponent (alpha(1)), power-law slope (beta), and turbulence onset and slope were measured in 600 patients at 5 to 7 days after AMI and in 416 patients at 12 months after AMI. In the multivariate analysis, after adjusting for clinical variables, only reduced fractal HR indexes, alpha1 and beta (p <0.01 for both), turbulence onset, and slope (p <0.05 for both), measured at the convalescent phase after AMI, predicted subsequent cardiac death. All time-domain and spectral HR variability indexes and turbulence onset increased significantly during the 12-month period after AMI (p <0.001 for all), whereas the fractal indexes and turbulence slope remained unchanged. Late after AMI, reduced beta (p <0.05) and turbulence slope (p <0.01) were the only independent predictors of cardiac mortality. Traditional time-domain and spectral measurements of HR variability and turbulence onset improved significantly after AMI, whereas the fractal HR dynamics and turbulence slope remained stable. Fractal HR variability and HR turbulence retain their prognostic power in the BB era, when measured either at the convalescent or late phase after AMI.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis has emerged as an important research topic to evaluate autonomic cardiac function. However, traditional time and frequency-domain analysis characterizes and quantify only linear and stationary phenomena. In the present investigation, we made a comparative analysis of three alternative approaches (i.e., wavelet multifractal analysis, Lyapunov exponents and multiscale entropy analysis) for quantifying nonlinear dynamics in heart rate time series. Note that these extracted nonlinear features provide information about nonlinear scaling behaviors and the complexity of cardiac systems. To evaluate the performance, we used 24-hour HRV recordings from 54 healthy subjects and 29 heart failure patients, available in PhysioNet. Three nonlinear methods are evaluated not only individually but also in combination using three classification algorithms, i.e., linear discriminate analysis, quadratic discriminate analysis and k-nearest neighbors. Experimental results show that three nonlinear methods capture nonlinear dynamics from different perspectives and the combined feature set achieves the best performance, i.e., sensitivity 97.7% and specificity 91.5%. Collectively, nonlinear HRV features are shown to have the promise to identify the disorders in autonomic cardiovascular function.},

abstract = {Arousals from sleep are associated with increased sympathetic activation and are therefore associated with peripheral vasoconstriction. We hypothesized that digital vasoconstrictions as measured by peripheral arterial tonometery (PAT), combined with an increase in pulse rate, would accurately reflect arousals from sleep, and can provide an autonomic arousal index (AAI). Based on a previously studied group of 40 sleep apnea patients simultaneously recorded by both polysomnography (PSG) and PAT systems, an automated algorithm using the PAT signal (and pulse rate derived from it) was developed for detection of arousals from sleep. This was further validated in a separate group of 96 subjects (85 patients referred with suspected obstructive sleep apnea and 11 healthy volunteers mean age 46.2+/-14.4 years, BMI 28.5+/-5.4 kg/m2). All underwent a whole night PSG with simultaneous PAT recording. The PSG recordings were blindly manually analyzed for arousals based on American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) criteria, while PAT was scored automatically. There was a significant correlation between PSG and PAT arousals (R=0.82, p<0.0001) with a good agreement across a wide range of values, with a ROC curve having an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88. We conclude that automated analysis of the peripheral arterial tonometry signal can detect EEG arousals from sleep, in a relatively quick and reproducible fashion.},

abstract = {Although the sympathetic nervous system innervates the lung, little is known about its participation in host immunity to pulmonary pathogens. In this study, we show that peripheral sympathectomy reduces mouse morbidity and mortality from influenza A virus-induced pneumonia due to reduced inflammatory influx of monocytes, neutrophils, and NK cells. Mortality was also delayed by treating mice with an alpha-adrenergic antagonist. Sympathectomy diminished the immediate innate cytokine responses, particularly IL-1, which was profoundly reduced. These findings demonstrate an unexpected role for the sympathetic nervous system in innate antiviral immunity and in exacerbating the pathology of a virus of great significance to human and animal health.},

Although there are many established tools for diagnosis, prognosis, and clinical decision making, understanding the advantages and limitations of each tool according the clinical scenario is essential. Several emerging tools, such as novel biomarkers (e.g., high-sensitivity troponin and growth differential factor-15), ECG techniques (e.g., heart rate turbulence or T-wave alternans), and imaging modalities (computed tomography angiography and cardiac magnetic resonance) may potentially improve clinical care; however, they must be fully evaluated and validated in different scenarios and patient cohorts before they are incorporated into clinical practice. This review identifies promising new or emerging techniques, as well as established tools, and reviews their current or potential role in clinical practice.},

abstract = {It has long been hypothesized that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) increases coronary heart disease (CHD) risk; however, empirical evidence is limited. In the first prospective study to date, individuals with higher PTSD symptom levels had a significantly increased risk for CHD, after controlling for known coronary risk factors. PTSD indicates a chronic stress reaction and is hypothesized to influence CHD either by causing biological alterations that lead to cardiovascular damage, or by leading to adverse health behaviors that increase CHD risk. A key issue is whether PTSD contributes to the development of CHD, if PTSD and CHD share common pathways, or if CHD causes PTSD. Research combined across different disciplines suggests that prolonged or chronic stress does influence the development of CHD. A better understanding of the relationship will increase prevention and intervention efforts. Cardiologists may be most effective when they can recognize and manage emotional distress in practice.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dynamic analysis techniques may quantify abnormalities in heart rate variability (HRV) based on nonlinear and fractal analysis (chaos theory). The article emphasizes clinical and prognostic significance of dynamic changes in short-time series applied on patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) during the exercise electrocardiograph (ECG) test. METHODS: The subjects were included in the series after complete cardiovascular diagnostic data. Series of R-R and ST-T intervals were obtained from exercise ECG data after sampling digitally. The range rescaled analysis method determined the fractal dimension of the intervals. To quantify fractal long-range correlation's properties of heart rate variability, the detrended fluctuation analysis technique was used. Approximate entropy (ApEn) was applied to quantify the regularity and complexity of time series, as well as unpredictability of fluctuations in time series. RESULTS: It was found that the short-term fractal scaling exponent (alpha(1)) is significantly lower in patients with CHD (0.93 +/- 0.07 vs 1.09 +/- 0.04; P < 0.001). The patients with CHD had higher fractal dimension in each exercise test program separately, as well as in exercise program at all. ApEn was significant lower in CHD group in both RR and ST-T ECG intervals (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The nonlinear dynamic methods could have clinical and prognostic applicability also in short-time ECG series. Dynamic analysis based on chaos theory during the exercise ECG test point out the multifractal time series in CHD patients who loss normal fractal characteristics and regularity in HRV. Nonlinear analysis technique may complement traditional ECG analysis.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function, has been associated with cognitive function, but studies are conflicting. Previous studies have also not controlled for familial and genetic influences. METHODS: We performed power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory ECGs in 416 middle-aged male twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Memory and learning were measured by verbal and visual Selective Reminding Tests (SRTs). Mixed-effect regression models were used to calculate associations between and within twin pairs, while adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: The mean age (standard deviation) was 55 (2.9) years. A statistically significant positive association was found between measures of HRV and verbal, but not visual, SRT scores. The most statistically significant unadjusted association was found between very low frequency HRV and verbal total recall SRT, such that each logarithm of increase in very low frequency was associated with an increased verbal SRT score of 4.85 points (p = .002). The association persisted despite the adjustment for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors, and after accounting for familial and genetic factors by comparing twins within pairs. A significant interaction was found between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and HRV, such that total power and ultra low frequency were associated with SRT in twins (n = 362) without PTSD, but not in those with PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: Lower frequency spectra of HRV are associated with verbal, but not visual, learning and memory, particularly in subjects without PTSD. This association may indicate that autonomic nervous system dysregulation plays a role in cognitive decline.},

abstract = {Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors) reduce plasma cholesterol and improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation, inflammation and oxidative stress. A 'pleiotropic' property of statins receiving less attention is their effect on the autonomic nervous system. Increased central sympathetic outflow and diminished cardiac vagal tone are disturbances characteristic of a range of cardiovascular conditions for which statins are now prescribed routinely to reduce cardiovascular events: following myocardial infarction, and in hypertension, chronic kidney disease, heart failure and diabetes. The purpose of the present review is to synthesize contemporary evidence that statins can improve autonomic circulatory regulation. In experimental preparations, high-dose lipophilic statins have been shown to reduce adrenergic outflow by attenuating oxidative stress in central brain regions involved in sympathetic and parasympathetic discharge induction and modulation. In patients with hypertension, chronic kidney disease and heart failure, lipophilic statins, such as simvastatin or atorvastatin, have been shown to reduce MNSA (muscle sympathetic nerve activity) by 12-30%. Reports concerning the effect of statin therapy on HRV (heart rate variability) are less consistent. Because of their implications for BP (blood pressure) control, insulin sensitivity, arrhythmogenesis and sudden cardiac death, these autonomic nervous system actions should be considered additional mechanisms by which statins lower cardiovascular risk.},

abstract = {A beat-to-beat model of the cardiovascular system is developed to study the spontaneous short-term variability in arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) data from humans at rest. The model consists of a set of difference equations representing the following mechanisms: 1) control of HR and peripheral resistance by the baroreflex, 2) Windkessel properties of the systemic arterial tree, 3) contractile properties of the myocardium (Starling's law and restitution), and 4) mechanical effects of respiration on BP. The model is tested by comparing power spectra and cross spectra of simulated data from the model with spectra of actual data from resting subjects. To make spectra from simulated data and from actual data tally, it must be assumed that respiratory sinus arrhythmia at rest is caused by the conversion of respiratory BP variability into HR variability by the fast, vagally mediated baroreflex. The so-called 10-s rhythm in HR and BP appears as a resonance phenomenon due to the delay in the sympathetic control loop of the baroreflex. The simulated response of the model to an imposed increase of BP is shown to correspond with the BP and HR response in patients after administration of a BP-increasing drug, such as phenylephrine. It is concluded that the model correctly describes a number of important features of the cardiovascular system. Mathematical properties of the difference-equation model are discussed.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Studies of the genetics of obstructive sleep apnea may be facilitated by identifying intermediate traits with high heritability that quantify etiological pathways, such as those related to respiratory control. Electrocardiogram (ECG)-based sleep spectrograms, measuring the coupling between respiratory modulation of ECG QRS-wave amplitude and heart rate variability, may provide measures of sleep state and ventilatory dynamics during sleep. We evaluated the familial aggregation of distinctive spectrographic biomarkers of unstable sleep, related to elevated-low frequency cardiopulmonary coupling (e-LFC), to assess their utility in genetic studies. METHODS: 622 participants from 137 families from the Cleveland Family Study underwent standardized polysomnography (PSG). From the ECG signal on the PSG, the interbeat interval time series and the corresponding ECG-derived respiratory signal were extracted, and the low frequency (0.01-0.1 Hz) component of their coupling was computed using a fully automated method. Narrow sense heritability of e-LFC was calculated using variance component methods. RESULTS: A spectral marker of abnormal low frequency cardiopulmonary coupling (e-LFC) demonstrated moderate correlation with apnea hypopnea index (AHI; r = 0.35, P < 0.0001). The heritability estimate for e-LFC, after adjusting for age and sex was 0.32 (P < 10-5) and remained unchanged after additionally adjusting for body mass index or AHI. In biological relatives of those with sleep apnea, a related marker of e-LFC was more prevalent than in controls (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 30% of the variability of e-LFC, measured from a continuous ECG during sleep, is explained by familial factors other than BMI. ECG-based spectrographic measures of cardiopulmonary coupling may provide novel phenotypes for characterizing subgroups of individuals with different propensities and genetic etiologies for sleep apnea or for other conditions associated with sleep fragmentation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been linked to increased morbidity. An inflexibility of the autonomic nervous system might be the underlying mechanism. We aimed to assess whether PTSD and combat trauma exposure are associated with lower heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function and a predictor of death. METHODS: We measured HRV by power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram in 459 middle-aged veteran male twins. Combat trauma was assessed with the combat exposure scale, and current and remitted PTSD was assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders. Mixed-effects regression models were used to test associations of PTSD and HRV between and within twin pairs. RESULTS: Of all twins, 211 had combat exposure, 31 had current PTSD, and 43 had remitted PTSD. Current PTSD was inversely associated with very-low-frequency and low-frequency HRV both in individual twins and within 20 pairs discordant for current PTSD. Twins with current PTSD had a 49% lower low-frequency HRV than their brothers without PTSD (p<.001). Remitted PTSD was not associated with HRV. Results were robust to adjustment for depression and other risk factors. Combat exposure was inversely associated with most HRV frequencies, but this association mostly diminished after adjustment for current PTSD. CONCLUSION: In middle-aged veteran men, combat exposure and current PTSD are associated with measures of autonomic inflexibility previously shown to have prognostic significance. The negative health impact of combat exposure on autonomic function is mediated largely through PTSD and might reverse with remission of PTSD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Women have worse outcomes when they experience acute myocardial infarction (MI), but the reasons for this sex-related difference are not well understood. Because cardiovascular neural regulation plays an important role in cardiac mortality, we studied possible sex-related differences in the autonomic modulation of heart rate (HR) in middle-aged subjects without known heart disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and HR variability were studied in randomly selected, age-matched populations of middle-aged women (n = 186; mean age, 50 +/- 6 years) and men (n = 188; mean age, 50 +/- 6 years) without hypertension, diabetes, or clinical or echocardiographic evidence of heart disease. BRS measured from the overshoot phase of the Valsalva maneuver was significantly lower in women (8.0 +/- 4.6 ms/mm Hg, n = 152) than in men (10.5 +/- 4.6 ms/mm Hg, n = 151) (P < .001), and the low-frequency component of HR variability measured from ECG recordings also was lower in women (P < .001), whereas the high-frequency component was higher in women than in men (P < .001). The ratio between the low-and high-frequency oscillations also was lower in the women (P < .001). The increase of HR and decrease of high-frequency component of HR variability in response to an upright posture were smaller in magnitude in women than in men (P < .01 for both). After adjustment for differences in the baseline-variables, such as blood pressure, HR, smoking, alcohol consumption, and psychosocial score, the sex-related differences in BRS and HR variability still remained significant (P < .001 for all). Women with estrogen replacement therapy (n = 46) had significantly higher BRS and total HR variance than the age-matched women without hormone treatment (P < .01 for both), and the BRS and HR variability of the women with estrogen therapy did not differ from those of the age-matched men. CONCLUSIONS: Baroreflex responsiveness is attenuated in middle-aged women compared with men, but the tonic vagal modulation of HR is augmented. Hormone replacement therapy appears to have favorable effects on the cardiovascular autonomic regulation in postmenopausal women.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to characterize the functional relationships between behaviorally evoked regional brain activation and cardiac autonomic activity in humans. Concurrent estimates of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF; obtained by positron emission tomography), heart period, and high-frequency heart period variability (HF-HPV; an indicator of cardiac parasympathetic activity) were examined in 93 adults (aged 50-70 years) who performed a series of increasingly difficult working-memory tasks. Increased task difficulty resulted in decreased heart period (indicating cardioacceleration) and decreased HF-HPV (indicating decreased cardiac parasympathetic activity). Task-induced decreases in heart period and HF-HPV were associated with concurrent increases and decreases in rCBF to cortical and subcortical brain regions that are speculated to regulate cardiac autonomic activity during behavioral processes: the medial-prefrontal, insular, and anterior cingulate cortices, the amygdala-hippocampal complex, and the cerebellum. These findings replicate and extend a small number of functional neuroimaging studies that suggest an important role for both cortical and subcortical brain systems in human cardiac autonomic regulation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although heart rate variability (HRV) at 0.1 Hz has been proposed as a noninvasive clinical measure of cardiac sympathetic nerve firing, this premise has not been sufficiently validated by comparison with techniques such as microneurography and the measurement of norepinephrine spillover from the heart that more directly reflect presynaptic sympathetic activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared the three techniques under conditions of effective cardiac sympathetic denervation, pure autonomic failure (n = 4), dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency (n = 1), and after cardiac transplantation (n = 9) as well as in the context of sympathetic nervous activation in cardiac failure (n = 15) and with aging (n = 10). Age-matched comparisons were made in each case with healthy individuals drawn from a pool of 52 volunteers. In pure autonomic failure and early after transplantation, cardiac norepinephrine spillover was negligible, and HRV was low. Late after transplantation, however, cardiac norepinephrine spillover returned to normal levels, and HRV remained low. In comparison to younger subjects (18 to 35 years old), older individuals (60 to 75 years old) had higher muscle sympathetic nerve activity (young, 22.9 +/- 1.9; old, 31.3 +/- 5.8 bursts per minute; P < .05) and cardiac norepinephrine spillover (young, 14.3 +/- 2.5; old, 20.1 +/- 3.0 ng/min; P < .05). In contrast, total HRV was reduced by 89%, and at 0.1 Hz it was reduced by 93% (P < .05). Cardiac failure was also characterized by elevated cardiac norepinephrine spillover (cardiac failure patients, 59 +/- 4; healthy volunteers, 18 +/- 3 ng/min; P < .01) but reduced 0.1 Hz HRV (cardiac failure patients, 49 +/- 17; healthy volunteers, 243 +/- 4 ms2; P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: HRV at 0.1 Hz depends on factors in addition to cardiac sympathetic nerve firing rates, including multiple neural reflexes, cardiac adrenergic receptor sensitivity, postsynaptic signal transduction, and electrochemical coupling, and is not directly related to cardiac norepinephrine spillover, which is a more direct measure of the sympathetic nerve firing rate.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently we showed the predictive value of sum absolute QRST integral (SAI QRST) and repolarization lability for risk stratification of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in heart failure patients. The goal of this study was to compare SAI QRST and metrics of depolarization and repolarization variability in healthy men and women.

METHODS: Orthogonal ECGs were recorded at rest for 10 minutes in 160 healthy men and women (mean age 39.6±14.6, 80 men). Mean spatial TT' angle, and normalized variances of T loop area, of spatial T vector amplitude, of QT interval and Tpeak-Tend area were measured for assessment of repolarization lability. Normalized variances of spatial QRS vector and QRS loop area characterized variability of depolarization. In addition, variability indices (VI) were calculated to adjust for normalized heart rate variance. SAI QRST was measured as the averaged arithmetic sum of areas under the QRST curve.

RESULTS: Men were characterized by shorter QTc (430.3±21.7 vs. 444.7±22.2 ms; P<0.0001) and larger SAI QRST (282.1±66.7 vs. 204.9±58.5 mV*ms; P<0.0001). Repolarization lability negatively correlated with spatial T vector amplitude. Adjusted by normalized heart rate variance, QT variability index was significantly higher in women than in men (-1.54±0.38 vs. -1.70±0.33; P = 0.017). However, in multivariate logistic regression after adjustment for body surface area, QTc, and spatial T vector amplitude, healthy men had 1.5-3 fold higher probability of having larger repolarization lability, as compared to healthy women (T vector amplitude variability index odds ratio 3.88 (95%CI 1.4-11.1; P = 0.012).

CONCLUSIONS: Healthy men more likely than women have larger repolarization lability.},

The present study examined associations among severity of lifetime victimization, current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and heart rate (AHR) levels and variability. Thirty-nine healthy post-menopausal women who endorsed a history of criminal victimization completed a measure of PTSD symptom severity and participated in an average of 18 h of ambulatory cardiovascular monitoring. PTSD symptom clusters were associated with AHR. Symptom clusters and lifetime victimization severity jointly predicted ABP, with ABP the highest among severely victimized women with high levels of current intrusions. Given the prevalence of criminal victimization, biopsychosocial research on women's cardiovascular disease risk may benefit from increased attention to this stressor and its psychological sequelae.},

abstract = {Recent investigations using direct (microneurographic) recordings of MSNA have provided a substantial amount of new information on the regulation of sympathetic nervous system control of nonactive skeletal muscle blood flow during exercise in humans. Some of the new conclusions from these studies discussed in this review include: 1. The direction, pattern and magnitude of the MSNA response to exercise depend on the collective influence of a number of factors, including the mode (isometric or rhythmic), intensity, and duration of the exercise, the size of the contracting muscle mass, and possibly the level of conditioning (physical training) of the exercising muscles. The MSNA response also appears to be tightly coupled with the onset and progression of muscle fatigue, at least during sustained, isometric contractions. 2. Increases in MSNA evoked during exercise with the arms are fairly uniform among different skeletal muscle nerves, and these responses correlate strongly with changes in venous plasma norepinephrine concentrations, limb vascular resistance and arterial blood pressure. Thus, increases in this neural activity during exercise are associated with the expected physiological responses. 3. The MSNA response to the same level of exercise varies markedly among healthy subjects but appears to be consistent over time within a particular subject. 4. The muscle metaboreflex (muscle chemoreflex) is the primary-mechanism by which MSNA is stimulated during small-muscle, isometric exercise in humans. In contrast, central command has a relatively weak influence on MSNA during this type of exercise. 5. Muscle metaboreflex-stimulation of MSNA also occurs during dynamic exercise, but only at or above moderate, submaximal intensities (i.e., not during mild exercise). 6. Muscle metaboreflex-evoked increases in MSNA during exercise are strongly associated with glycogenolysis and the consequent cellular accumulation of hydrogen ions in the contracting muscles. 7. Sympathoinhibitory cardiopulmonary reflexes do not appear to modulate the MSNA responses to isometric exercise in the healthy human. However, arterial baroreflexes exert a potent inhibitory effect on MSNA during this form of exercise. The mechanisms involved in the regulation of MSNA during large-muscle, dynamic leg exercise is an important topic for future investigations, as is the relationship between MSNA and sympathetic outflow to other regional circulations (e.g., heart, viscera, skin) during various forms of exercise.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heritable electrocardiographic (ECG) and heart rate variability (HRV) measures, reflecting pacemaking, conduction, repolarization and autonomic function in the heart have been associated with risks for cardiac arrhythmias. Whereas several rare monogenic conditions with extreme phenotypes have been noted, few common genetic factors contributing to interindividual variability in ECG and HRV measures have been identified. We report the results of a community-based genomewide association study of six ECG and HRV intermediate traits. METHODS: Genotyping using Affymetrix 100K GeneChip was conducted on 1345 related Framingham Heart Study Original and Offspring cohort participants. We analyzed 1175 Original and Offspring participants with ECG data (mean age 52 years, 52% women) and 548 Offspring participants with HRV data (mean age 48 years, 51% women), in relation to 70,987 SNPs with minor allele frequency > or = 0.10, call rate > or = 80%, Hardy-Weinberg p-value > or = 0.001. We used generalized estimating equations to test association of SNP alleles with multivariable-adjusted residuals for QT, RR, and PR intervals, the ratio of low frequency to high frequency power (LF/HFP), total power (TP) and the standard deviation of normal RR intervals (SDNN). RESULTS: Associations at p < 10(-3) were found for 117 (QT), 105 (RR), 111 (PR), 102 (LF/HF), 121 (TP), and 102 (SDNN) SNPs. Several common variants in NOS1AP (4 SNPs with p-values < 10(-3); lowest p-value, rs6683968, p = 1 x 10(-4)) were associated with adjusted QT residuals, consistent with our previously reported finding for NOS1AP in an unrelated sample of FHS Offspring and other cohorts. All results are publicly available at NCBI's dbGaP at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007 webcite. CONCLUSION: In the community-based Framingham Heart Study none of the ECG and HRV results individually attained genomewide significance. However, the presence of bona fide QT-associated SNPs among the top 117 results for QT duration supports the importance of efforts to validate top results from the reported scans. Finding genetic variants associated with ECG and HRV quantitative traits may identify novel genes and pathways implicated in arrhythmogenesis and allow for improved recognition of individuals at high risk for arrhythmias in the general population.},

abstract = {Patients with panic disorder provide a clinical model of stress. On a "good day," free from a panic attack, they show persistent stress-related changes in sympathetic nerve biology, including abnormal sympathetic nerve single-fiber firing ("salvos" of multiple firing within a cardiac cycle) and release of epinephrine as a cotransmitter. The coreleased epinephrine perhaps originates from in situ synthesis by phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT). In searching for biological evidence that essential hypertension is caused by mental stress--a disputed proposition--we note parallels with panic disorder, which provides an explicit clinical model of stress: (1) There is clinical comorbidity; panic disorder prevalence is increased threefold in essential hypertension. (2) For both, epinephrine cotransmission is present in sympathetic nerves. (3) In panic disorder and essential hypertension, but not in health, single-fiber sympathetic nerve firing salvos occur. (4) Tissue nerve growth factor is increased in both conditions (nerve growth factor is a stress reactant). (5) There is induction of PNMT in sympathetic nerves. Essential hypertension exhibits a further manifestation of mental stress: there is activation of noradrenergic brain stem neurons projecting to the hypothalamus and amygdala. These pathophysiological findings strongly support the view that chronic mental stress is important in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension. A hypothesis now under test is whether in both disorders, under prevailing conditions of ongoing stress, PNMT induced in sympathetic nerves acts as a DNA methylase, causing the norepinephrine transporter (NET) gene silencing that is present in both conditions. PNMT can have an intranuclear distribution, binding to DNA. We have demonstrated that the reduced neuronal noradrenaline reuptake present in both disorders does have an epigenetic mechanism, with demonstrable reduction in the abundance of the transporter protein, the NET gene silencing being associated with DNA binding by the methylation-related inhibitory transcription factor MeCP2.},

abstract = {Various combinations of sympathetic and vagal tone can yield the same heart rate, while ventricular electrophysiology differs. To demonstrate this in humans, we studied healthy volunteers in the sitting position with horizontal legs. First, heart rate was increased by lowering the legs to 60 degrees and back. Thereafter, heart rate was increased by handgrip. In each subject, a leg-lowering angle was selected at which heart rate matched best with heart rate in the third handgrip minute. Thirteen subjects had a heart rate match better than 1%. Heart rate (control: 65.2+/-9.0 bpm) increased to 72.1+/-8.7 (leg lowering) and to 72.1+/-8.8 (handgrip) bpm. QRS azimuth, QRS duration, maximal T vector, T azimuth, T elevation, ST duration, QRS-T angle and QT interval differed significantly (P<0.05) between leg lowering and handgrip (QT interval 418+/-15 versus 435+/-21 ms). Also, septal dispersion of repolarization, assessed as the time difference between the apex and the end of the T wave in the V2 and V3 leads, differed significantly (V2: 96.7+/-19.3 versus 110.0+/-23.3 ms, P<0.01; V3: 88.7+/-19.3 versus 97.3+/-23.3 ms; P<0.01). Hence, leg lowering and handgrip cause different ventricular depolarization and repolarization. The hypertensive handgrip manoeuvre entails a longer QT interval and probably an increased septal dispersion of repolarization.},

abstract = {Power spectrum analysis of cardiovascular signal variability, and in particular of the RR period (heart rate variability, HRV), is a widely used methodology for investigating autonomic neural regulation in health and disease that can quantify the sympathovagal balance modulating the sinus node pacemaker. In some cases, it can also quantify the neural regulation of other organs or apparatuses. However, use of the correct methodology is crucial to extract the information embedded in the frequency domain. In numerous abnormal conditions, such as essential arterial hypertension, acute myocardial infarction and heart failure, the sympathovagal balance may be altered in basal conditions. However, a reduced responsiveness to an excitatory stimulus is the most common feature that characterizes numerous pathophysiological states. The attenuation of an oscillatory pattern can also reflect an altered target function, thus providing important prognostic markers. The general features of this approach correspond well to the needs of an internist attempting to envisage the involvement of the whole organism in a disease process.},

abstract = {Heart rate (HR) variability has been extensively studied in cardiac patients, especially in patients surviving an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and also in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. The majority of studies have shown that patients with reduced or abnormal HR variability have an increased risk of mortality within a few years after an AMI or after a diagnosis of CHF/LV dysfunction. Various measures of HR dynamics, such as time-domain, spectral, and non-linear measures of HR variability have been used in risk stratification. The prognostic power of various measures, except of those reflecting rapid R-R interval oscillations, has been almost identical, albeit some non-linear HR variability measures, such as short-term fractal scaling exponent have provided somewhat better prognostic information than the others. Abnormal HR variability predicts both sudden and non-sudden cardiac death. Because of remodeling of the arrhythmia substrate after AMI, early measurement of HR variability to identify those at high risk should likely be repeated later in order to assess the risk of fatal arrhythmia events. Future randomized trials using HR variability/turbulence as one of the pre-defined inclusion criteria will show whether routine measurement of HR variability/turbulence will become a routine clinical tool for risk stratification of cardiac patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart rate variability (HRV) is reported as a surrogate index for clinical outcome in trials of secondary prevention strategies for coronary artery disease (CAD), but a standardized guide for interpreting HRV change is not established. DESIGN: We evaluated HRV change in trials with CAD patients who received conventional medications (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors), biobehavioral treatment (psychotropics, biofeedback, relaxation) or exercise training. METHODS: Medline, Pubmed, Psycinfo, the Cochrane database, and Embase were searched until July 2007, without language restriction. We identified 33 randomized controlled trials. Two reviewers independently abstracted all trials using a standardized form. A hierarchy of frequency and time domain HRV indices defined outcome. RESULTS: A random-effects model yielded an overall pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) between treatment and control groups of moderate magnitude across treatment classes, based on a composite of time and frequency domain indices (SMD=0.40, P<0.0001), or only time or frequency indices (SMD=0.37 and 0.43, respectively, both P<0.0001). This change was equivalent to an increase in standard deviation of all normal-to-normal RR intervals of 9.0 ms (95% Confidence Interval, CI, 7.3, 10.7 ms) or a relative increase of 15.9% (95% CI, 13.2, 18.6%). To detect HRV change of this magnitude, a hypothetical trial would require a sample size of 660 patients for conventional medications or 1232 patients for all treatment classes. CONCLUSION: Pharmacologic, biobehavioral and exercise strategies for secondary prevention of CAD significantly increase HRV. This review provides a framework to assist efforts to evaluate the contribution of HRV change to CAD prognosis.},

abstract = {There are complex interactions between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system inputs to the sinus node. The concept of "sympathovagal balance" reflects the autonomic state resulting from the sympathetic and parasympathetic influences. Despite widespread usage of a variety of heart rate (HR) variability parameters as indexes of sympathovagal balance, no index has been validated as a measure of sympathovagal balance. This study evaluated the utility of HR, HR variability, and a new parameter termed the vagal-sympathetic effect (VSE) as indexes of sympathovagal balance. The ideal parameter had to satisfy the following criteria: 1) the index should vary similarly among subjects in response to different autonomic conditions; 2) the variability in the index among subjects exposed to the same autonomic conditions should be small; and 3) the response of the index to various autonomic conditions should reflect the underlying changes in physiological state and have a meaningful interpretation. Volunteers [8 men, 6 women; mean age 28.5 {+/-} 4.8 (SD) yr] were evaluated for the effects of sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation and blockade on HR and HR variability. VSE was defined as the ratio of the R-R interval to the intrinsic R-R interval. VSE and R-R interval consistently changed in the expected directions with parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation and blockade. A general linearized model was used to evaluate the response of each parameter. VSE and R-R interval had r2 values of 0.847 and 0.852, respectively. Natural logarithm of the low-frequency power had an r2 value of 0.781 with lower r2 values for all the other HR variability parameters. The coefficient of variation was also lowest for each condition tested for the VSE and the R-R interval. VSE and R-R interval best satisfy the criteria for the ideal index of sympathovagal balance. Because it is impractical under most conditions to measure the VSE as the index of sympathovagal balance, the most suitable index is the R-R interval.

abstract = {Insulin resistance (IR), the hallmark of type 2 diabetes, may be under epigenetic control. This study examines the association between global DNA methylation and IR using 84 monozygotic twin pairs. IR was estimated using homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). Global DNA methylation of Alu repeats in peripheral blood leukocytes was quantified by bisulfite pyrosequencing. The association between global DNA methylation and IR was examined using generalized estimating equation (GEE) and within-twin pair analyses, adjusting for potential confounders. Results show that methylation levels at all four CpG sites were individually associated with IR by GEE (all false discovery rate-adjusted P values≤0.026). A 10% increase in mean Alu methylation was associated with an increase of 4.55 units (95% CI 2.38-6.73) in HOMA. Intrapair difference in IR was significantly associated with intrapair difference in global methylation level. A 10% increase in the difference in mean Alu methylation was associated with an increase of 4.54 units (0.34-8.71; P=0.036) in the difference in HOMA. Confirmation of the results by intrapair analyses suggests that genetic factors do not confound the association between global DNA methylation and IR. Exclusion of twins taking diabetes medication (n=17) did not change our results.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate in trauma survivors the predictive validity of heightened physiological responsivity to script-driven imagery for the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and to evaluate the interactive effect of survivors' sex. Physiological responses to idiosyncratic trauma reminders may be predictive of later PTSD. The majority of previous studies have been cross sectional and have produced mixed findings. Sex differences may contribute to this heterogeneity. METHODS: Heart rate (HR) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia were measured at 2 weeks post trauma in 158 assault survivors during baseline and as they listened to an idiosyncratic trauma script. At 6 months, 15.2% of male and 28.1% of female participants met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. RESULTS: Generalized linear model and logistic regression analyses showed that HR response to script-driven imagery and sex interacted in predicting PTSD symptom severity at 6 months. Women had greater PTSD symptom severities overall. Female HR responders to script-driven imagery showed the highest PTSD symptom severities and were almost three times more likely to develop PTSD at 6 months compared with men and female nonresponders (odds ratio, 2.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-6.57). Respiratory sinus arrhythmia responder type did not predict PTSD (odds ratio, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.30-1.33). CONCLUSION: Female trauma survivors who respond to trauma reminders with increased HR may be at particular risk of developing PTSD. Physiological reactivity to trauma cues may be a useful index for screening and prevention of PTSD.},

abstract = {Recent studies have found a significant association between PTSD and low heart rate variability (HRV), a biomarker of autonomic dysregulation. Research indicates that respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) biofeedback increases HRV while reducing related pathological symptoms. This controlled pilot study compared RSA biofeedback to progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) as adjunctive interventions for 38 persons with PTSD symptoms in a residential treatment facility for a substance use disorder. Both groups were assessed at pre-intervention and 4-week post-intervention. Group x time interactions revealed significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms and increases in HRV indices for the RSA group. Both groups significantly reduced PTSD and insomnia symptoms and a statistical trend was observed for reduced substance craving for the RSA group. Increases in HRV were significantly associated with PTSD symptom reduction. Overall, these results provide preliminary support for the efficacy of RSA biofeedback in improving physiological and psychological health for individuals with PTSD.},
