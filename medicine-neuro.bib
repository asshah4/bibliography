abstract = {Background: The purpose of this study was to measure lumbar epidural pressure (EP) during the insertion of a Tuohy needle under general anesthesia and to evaluate the influence of airway pressure on EP. Methods: Lumbar EP was measured directly through a Tuohy needle during intermittent positive pressure ventilation in fifteen patients. Mean and peak EP were recorded after peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) of 0, 15, and 25 cmH2O. Results: All measured lumbar EPs were positive, with the pressure increasing during inspiration and decreasing during expiration. Median EP was 6.0 mmHg (interquartile range, 4.0-8.0) at 0 cmH2O of PIP, 6.5 mmHg (4.5-8.5) at 15 cmH2O, and 8.5 mmHg (6.0-10.5) at 25 cmH2O, increasing significantly at 15 cm H2O PIP, and further increasing at 25 cmH2O (P < 0.001). Conclusions: We demonstrate the influence of increased airway pressure on lumbar EP measured directly through a Tuohy needle. Lumbar EPs were positive, and increasing PIP levels significantly increased lumbar EP.},

abstract = {Cefepime is a widely used antibiotic with neurotoxicity attributed to its ability to cross the blood–brain barrier and exhibit concentration-dependent ϒ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonism. Neurotoxic symptoms include depressed consciousness, encephalopathy, aphasia, myoclonus, seizures, and coma. Data suggest that up to 15% of ICU patients treated with cefepime may experience these adverse effects. Risk factors include renal dysfunction, excessive dosing, preexisting brain injury, and elevated serum cefepime concentrations. We aimed to characterize the clinical course of cefepime neurotoxicity and response to interventions. A librarian-assisted search identified publications describing cefepime-associated neurotoxicity from January 1980 to February 2016 using the CINAHL and MEDLINE databases. Search terms included cefepime, neurotoxicity, encephalopathy, seizures, delirium, coma, non-convulsive status epilepticus, myoclonus, confusion, aphasia, agitation, and death. Two reviewers independently assessed identified articles for eligibility and used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) for data reporting. Of the 123 citations identified, 37 (representing 135 patient cases) were included. Patients had a median age of 69 years, commonly had renal dysfunction (80%) and required intensive care (81% of patients with a reported location). All patients exhibited altered mental status, with reduced consciousness (47%), myoclonus (42%), and confusion (42%) being the most common symptoms. All 98 patients (73% of cohort) with electroencephalography had abnormalities, including non-convulsive status epilepticus (25%), myoclonic status epilepticus (7%), triphasic waves (40%), and focal sharp waves (39%). As per Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved dosing guidance, 48% of patients were overdosed; however, 26% experienced neurotoxicity despite appropriate dosing. Median cefepime serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations were 45 mg/L (n = 21) and 13 mg/L (n = 4), respectively. Symptom improvement occurred in 89% of patients, and 87% survived to hospital discharge. The median delay from starting the drug to symptom onset was 4 days, and resolution occurred a median of 2 days after the intervention, which included cefepime discontinuation, antiepileptic administration, or hemodialysis. Cefepime-induced neurotoxicity is challenging to recognize in the critically ill due to widely varying symptoms that are common in ICU patients. This adverse reaction can occur despite appropriate dosing, usually resolves with drug interruption, but may require additional interventions such as antiepileptic drug administration or dialysis.},

abstract = {Col{\'{a}}s R, Munoz R, Temprano R, G{\'{o}}mez C, Pascual J. Chronic daily headache with analgesic overuse: Epidemiology and impact on quality of life.Neurology.2004;62:1338-1342.Objective:To analyze the prevalence and demography of chronic daily headache (CDH) with analgesic overuse.Methods:A population of 9984 inhabitants aged 14 or older living in Santo{\~{n}}a, Spain, was studied. The authors personally interviewed 4855 subjects, using a quota sampling approach. Those with headache for 10 days/month and some analgesic use were asked to fill in a diary over the course of 1 month. Then, subjects were classified into CDH with or without analgesic overuse subtypes. Quality of life (Short Form-36 Health Survey [SF-36]) was also assessed in this second interview.Results:Headache for 10 days/month with analgesic consumption was reported by 332 subjects. Seven had secondary headache. Seventy-four (standardized prevalence 1.41%, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.8) fulfilled the criteria for CDH with analgesic overuse. Prevalence in women (2.6%, 2.0 to 3.3) was much higher than in men (0.19%, 0.006 to 0.52). Mean age was 56 years (range 19 to 82 years). As recalled by the subjects, the mean age at onset of CDH was 38 years (range 9 to 82 years), whereas the mean age at onset of CDH with frequent analgesic consumption was 45 years (range 19 to 80 years) and that of primary headache was 22 years (range 5 to 60 years). CDH subjects showed a significant decrease in each SF-36 health-related score as compared with healthy control subjects. Transformed migraine was diagnosed in 49 (prevalence 0.9%), chronic tension-type headache in 20 (0.4%), and new daily persistent headache in 5 (0.1%). Thirty-five percent of patients overused simple analgesics, 22% ergotics, 12.5% opioids, and 2.7% triptans; the remaining 27.8% were overusing different combinations.Conclusion:CDH with analgesic overuse is a common disorder in the general population, mainly in women in their fifties, in whom 5% meet its diagnostic criteria.Comment: This paper is important and also worrying. Spain and other Latin countries have historically allowed access to prescription only medicines, via pharmacies, without a physician's authorization (I write this partly based on my own anecdotal experience of purchasing them without authorization). This probably explains the high proportion of ergot-related-analgesic abuse and may suggest the same fate for the triptans when they become more widely available. It would be helpful for the IHS and AHS to provide a framework to ensure responsible access to these important prescription-only pharmaceuticals.-David S. Millson Schulte-Mattler WJ, Krack P, BoNTTH Study Group. Treatment of chronic tension-type headache with botulinum toxin A: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study.Pain. 2004;109:110-114.A beneficial effect of botulinum toxin on tension-type headache was reported in open-label studies but scientifically rigorous clinical studies are lacking. Therefore we conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Multiple pericranial muscles of 112 patients with chronic tension-type headache were treated either with 500 mouse units of botulinum toxin (Dysport(R)) or with placebo. The diagnoses were made strictly following the International Headache Society criteria. Co-existence of migraine was an exclusion criterion. Injections were made following a fixed scheme and not adjusted to the patient's symptoms. Patients kept a headache diary that was used to calculate the area under the headache curve of 6 weeks before and 12 weeks after the treatment as the main effect measure. Secondary effect measures were the number of days with headache, the number of days with intake of analgesics, the duration of the nocturnal sleep, and the Beck Depression Inventory score. There were no significant differences between the verum group and the placebo group in any of these variables. Seven patients of the verum group had transient weakness of the eyelids, the neck, or both, indicating that a higher dose tha used in this study does not seem sensible for the treatment of headache. The statistical power of the study was high enough to warrant the conclusion that there is no clinically significant effect of botulinum toxin A on chronic tension-type headache.Comment: It is important to ensure that this study, which demonstrates convincingly that botulinum toxin A was ineffective in the treatment of chronic tension-type headache, is given an equal'share of voice' as other studies suggesting that this treatment is effective. I wonder if the pharmaceutical news wires and public relations teams of'Botox' companies will be supporting this dissemination? I suspect not.-David S. MillsonI have become convinced of the effectiveness of botulinum neurotoxins in prophylaxis for many patients with episodic and chronic primary headaches, so I have reviewed this article carefully. It is an excellent study, well conducted and described. So, the unexpected results are not due to poor design. However, over the years the methods of administering botulinum neurotoxin have changed, increasing in number of sites injected, and decreasing in doses per injection. This parallels the theory that the toxin may work in pain by inhibiting sensory afferent neuropeptide release rather than by paralyzing muscles, and so a wider cachement area makes sense for injections. Also, many clinicians have switched to a combination of fixed site injections and a'follow the pain' approach to inhibit the'noisy' afferents. In this study, very few injections were given, compared to what is widely done now in the US. For example, the investigators gave only two injections per side in frontalis, temporalis, and occipitalis, and only one injection per side in occipitalis, splenius capitis, semispinalis, and, most surprising to me, trapezius. Most injectors in the United States give more injections in most of these sites, especially frontalis, temporalis, and trapezius. It is possible that the negative results are a result of this difference in methodology. Three large placebo controlled regulatory studies on botulinum neurotoxin type A for various primary headache types are close to completion in the US, so we should get some of the answers on efficacy and methodology in the next year.-Stewart J.

Analgesic overuse among subjects with headache, neck, and low-back pain.Neurology.2004;62:1540-1544.Objectives:To examine the prevalence of chronic headache (15 days/month) associated with analgesic overuse in relation to age and gender, and the association between analgesic overuse and chronic pain (i.e., migraine, non-migrainous headache, neck, and low-back pain).Methods:In the Nord-Tr{\o}ndelag Health Study 1995 to 1997 (HUNT-2), a total of 51,383 subjects responded to headache questions (Head-HUNT), of which 51,050 completed questions related to musculoskeletal symptoms and 49,064 questions regarding the use of analgesics.Results:The prevalence of chronic headache associated with analgesic use daily or almost daily for 1 month was 1% (1.3% for women and 0.7% for men) and for analgesic overuse duration of 3 months 0.9% (1.2% for women and 0.6% for men). Chronic headache was more than seven times more likely among those with analgesic overuse (1 month) than those without (odds ratio [OR]= 7.5, 95% CI: 6.6 to 8.5). Upon analysis of the different chronic pain subgroups separately, the association with analgesic overuse was strongest for chronic migraine (OR= 10.3, 95% CI: 8.1 to 13.0), intermediate for chronic nonmigrainous headache (OR= 6.2, 95% CI: 5.3 to 7.2), and weakest for chronic neck (OR= 2.6, 95% CI: 2.3 to 2.9) and chronic low-back (OR= 3.0, 95% CI: 2.7 to 3.3) pain. The association became stronger with increasing duration of analgesic use for all groups and was most evident among those with headache, especially those with migraine.Conclusions:Chronic headache associated with analgesic overuse is prevalent, and especially chronic migraine is more strongly associated with frequent intake of analgesics th n other common pain conditions like chronic neck and chronic low-back pain.},
