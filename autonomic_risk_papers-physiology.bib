abstract = {editor ANESTHESIOLOGY, V XXX • NO XXX XXX 2019 1 T horacic epidural anesthesia is widely applied in tho-racic and abdominal surgical procedures, because it provides excellent analgesia and decreases postoperative pulmonary complications. 1,2 Epidural anesthesia with local anesthetics produces sensory and motor blockade but also affects the autonomic nervous system. The resultant effects on the cardiovascular system vary with the level and the extent of sympathetic blockade. Involvement of the lower thoracic region (T6 to L1) by thoracic epidural anesthesia is associated with increased venous capacitance and redistribution of blood to the dilated splanchnic veins. This results in decreased venous return to the heart and a reduction of cardiac preload. 3 Arterial vasodilation in blocked segments is counteracted by compensatory vasoconstriction in unblocked segments, and the effect on cardiac afterload depends on the balance between blocked and unblocked segments. 4 Direct effects of cardiac sympatholysis have not been the subject of detailed investigation. Many studies quantified the cardiac effects of thoracic epidural anesthesia using load-dependent indices of contractile performance, which does not allow differentiation between direct and indirect effects. Regardless, the effects of thoracic epidural anesthesia have generally been considered beneficial to the cardiovascular system and protective against surgical stress. 5 Interestingly, recent systematic reviews have not been able to confirm improved cardiac outcome in surgical patients treated with thoracic epidural anesthesia. 6 In contrast, some evidence was found for increased cardiovascular problems in high-risk patients receiving neuraxial block. 7,8 In light of these concerns, a reappraisal of the cardiovascular effects associated with the use of thoracic epidural anesthesia seems appropriate. Since the last published review on this subject, 9 new data have emerged from experimental and clinical studies addressing previously unexplored domains such as the effects of cardiac sympathectomy on right ven-tricular function, an important determinant of outcome in surgery. 10-12 We conducted the present review to update the knowledge in this field, with focus on the effects associated with high-thoracic epidural anesthesia and cardiac sympa-thectomy in the normal and diseased cardiovascular system. Materials and Methods The databases PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane were searched by the author and by an independent expert librarian to identify studies in which the cardiac sympathetic nerves (T1 to T5) are involved in neural blockade by thoracic epidural anesthesia. An extensive list of used ABStRAct Cardiac sympathetic blockade with high-thoracic epidural anesthesia is considered beneficial in patients undergoing major surgery because it offers protection in ischemic heart disease. Major outcome studies have failed to confirm such a benefit, however. In fact, there is growing concern about potential harm associated with the use of thoracic epidural anesthesia in high-risk patients, although underlying mechanisms have not been identified. Since the latest review on this subject, a number of clinical and experimental studies have provided new information on the complex interaction between thoracic epidural anesthesia-induced sympatholysis and cardiovascular control mechanisms. Perhaps these new insights may help identify conditions in which benefits of thoracic epidural anesthesia may not outweigh potential risks. For example, cardiac sympathectomy with high-thoracic epidural anesthesia decreases right ventricular function and attenuates its capacity to cope with increased right ventricular afterload. Although the clinical significance of this pathophysiologic interaction is unknown at present, it identifies a subgroup of patients with established or pending pulmonary hypertension for whom outcome studies are needed. Other new areas of interest include the impact of thoracic epidural anesthesia-induced sympatholysis on cardiovascular control in conditions associated with increased sympathetic tone, surgical stress, and hemodynamic disruption. It was considered appropriate to collect and analyze all recent scientific information on this subject to provide a comprehensive update on the cardiovascular effects of high-thoracic epidural anesthesia and cardiac sympathectomy in healthy and diseased patients.},

abstract = {A novel isolated Langendorff perfused rabbit heart preparation with intact dual autonomic innervation is described. This preparation allows the study of the effects of direct sympathetic and vagus nerve stimulation on the physiology of the whole heart. These hearts (n = 10) had baseline heart rates of 146 +/- 2 beats x min(-1) which could be increased to 240 +/- 11 beats x min(-1) by sympathetic stimulation (15 Hz) and decreased to 74 +/- 11 beats x min(-1) by stimulation of the vagus nerve (right vagus, 7 Hz). This model has the advantage of isolated preparations, with the absence of influence from circulating hormones and haemodynamic reflexes, and also that of in vivo preparations where direct nerve stimulation is possible without the need to use pharmacological agents. Data are presented characterising the preparation with respect to the effects of autonomic nerve stimulation on intrinsic heart rate and atrioventricular conduction at different stimulation frequencies. We show that stimulation of the right and left vagus nerve have differential effects on heart rate and atrioventricular conduction.},

abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The understanding of the risk factors for CVD may yield important insights into the prevention, etiology, course, and treatment of this major public health concern. Autonomic imbalance, characterized by a hyperactive sympathetic system and a hypoactive parasympathetic system, is associated with various pathological conditions. Over time, excessive energy demands on the system can lead to premature aging and diseases. Therefore, autonomic imbalance may be a final common pathway to increased morbidity and mortality from a host of conditions and diseases, including cardiovascular disease. Heart rate variability (HRV) may be used to assess autonomic imbalances, diseases and mortality. Parasympathetic activity and HRV have been associated with a wide range of conditions including CVD. Here we review the evidence linking HRV to established and emerging modifiable and non-modifiable CVD risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, family history and work stress. Substantial evidence exists to support the notion that decreased HRV precedes the development of a number of risk factors and that lowering risk profiles is associated with increased HRV. We close with a suggestion that a model of autonomic imbalance may provide a unifying framework within which to investigate the impact of risk factors, including psychosocial factors and work stress, on cardiovascular disease. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {I HAVE already described on various occasions [1] [2] the effect of small doses of adrenalin upon the mammalian heart under chloroform. When the heart is affected by low concentrations of chloroform it is thrown by the action of adrenalin into a condition known as ventricular fibrillation, but when affected by full concentrations, such, for instance, as a 2 per cent. proportion of vapour to the inhaled 'air, ventricular fibrillation does not occur. What I have to say tonight is but the logical sequence of this principle. EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE HEART AFFECTED BY CHLOROFORM. What is ventricular fibrillation? Let me say at once that we have not at present a distinct conception of its intimate nature, but we are aware that ineffectual ventricular contractions succeed one another at a very rapid rate, and the function of the ventricles is entirely abolished; its clinical manifestation is therefore a sudden vascular collapse, and consequent instantaneous death. In the lower mammals fibrillation is generally a permanent condition, but in exceptional cases spontaneous recovery of the heart takes place. In the human subject (judging by the accounts of syncope resulting from-the injections of adrenalin under chloroform) recovery from fibrillation is of not infrequent occurrence. Despite the opinion, expressed some years ago by Professor McWilliam, that it might be found to explain sudden death in some JU-1},

abstract = {We hypothesized that selective control of ventricular contractility might be mediated by postganglionic parasympathetic neurons in the cranial medial ventricular (CMV) ganglion plexus located in a fat pad at the base of the aorta. Sinus rate, atrioventricular (AV) conduction (ventricular rate during atrial pacing), and left ventricular contractile force (LV dP/dt during right ventricular pacing) were measured in eight chloralose-anesthetized dogs both before and during bilateral cervical vagus stimulation (20-30 V, 0.5 ms pulses, 15-20 Hz). Seven of these dogs were tested under beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol, 0.8 mg kg -1 i.v.). Control responses included sinus node bradycardia or arrest during spontaneous rhythm, high grade AV block or complete heart block, and a 30% decrease in contractility from 2118 ± 186 to 1526 ± 187 mm Hg s -1 (P < 0.05). Next, the ganglionic blocker trimethaphan (0.3-1.0 ml of a 50 $\mu$g ml -1 solution) was injected into the CMV fat pad. Then vagal stimulation was repeated, which now produced a relatively small 5% (N.S., P > 0.05) decrease in contractility but still elicited the same degree of sinus bradycardia and AV block (N = 8, P < 0.05). Five dogs were re-tested 3 h after trimethaphan fat pad injection, at which time blockade of vagally-induced negative inotropy was partially reversed, as vagal stimulation decreased LV dP/dt by 19%. The same dose of trimethaphan given either locally into other fat pads (PVFP or IVC-ILA) or systemically (i.v.) had no effect on vagally-induced negative inotropy. Thus, parasympathetic ganglia located in the CMV fat pad mediated a decrease in ventricular contractility during vagal stimulation. Blockade of the CMV fat pad had no effect on vagally-mediated slowing of sinus rate or AV conduction.},

abstract = {Cardiac control is mediated via a series of reflex control networks involving somata in the (i) intrinsic cardiac ganglia (heart), (ii) intrathoracic extracardiac ganglia (stellate, middle cervical), (iii) superior cervical ganglia, (iv) spinal cord, (v) brainstem, and (vi) higher centers. Each of these processing centers contains afferent, efferent, and local circuit neurons, which interact locally and in an interdependent fashion with the other levels to coordinate regional cardiac electrical and mechanical indices on a beat-to-beat basis. This control system is optimized to respond to normal physiological stressors (standing, exercise, and temperature); however, it can be catastrophically disrupted by pathological events such as myocardial ischemia. In fact, it is now recognized that autonomic dysregulation is central to the evolution of heart failure and arrhythmias. Autonomic regulation therapy is an emerging modality in the management of acute and chronic cardiac pathologies. Neuromodulation-based approaches that target select nexus points of this hierarchy for cardiac control offer unique opportunities to positively affect therapeutic outcomes via improved efficacy of cardiovascular reflex control. As such, understanding the anatomical and physiological basis for such control is necessary to implement effectively novel neuromodulation therapies. {\textcopyright} 2016 American Physiological Society.

abstract = {Myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with remodeling of the heart and neurohumoral control systems. The objective of this study was to define time-dependent changes in intrinsic cardiac (IC) neuronal excitability, synaptic efficacy, and neurochemical modulation following MI. MI was produced in guinea pigs by ligation of the coronary artery and associated vein on the dorsal surface of the heart. Animals were recovered for 4, 7, 14, or 50. days. Intracellular voltage recordings were obtained in whole mounts of the cardiac neuronal plexus to determine passive and active neuronal properties of IC neurons. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated an immediate and persistent increase in the percentage of IC neurons immunoreactive for neuronal nitric oxide synthase. Examination of individual neuronal properties demonstrated that afterhyperpolarizing potentials were significantly decreased in both amplitude and time course of recovery at 7. days post-MI. These parameters returned to control values by 50. days post-MI. Synaptic efficacy, as determined by the stimulation of axonal inputs, was enhanced at 7. days post-MI only. Neuronal excitability in absence of agonist challenge was unchanged following MI. Norepinephrine increased IC excitability to intracellular current injections, a response that was augmented post-MI. Angiotensin II potentiation of norepinephrine and bethanechol-induced excitability, evident in controls, was abolished post-MI. This study demonstrates that MI induces both persistent and transient changes in IC neuronal functions immediately following injury. Alterations in the IC neuronal network, which persist for weeks after the initial insult, may lead to alterations in autonomic signaling and cardiac control. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Dysfunction of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system is implicated in the genesis of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. While this system has been studied extensively in animal models, far less is known about the intrinsic cardiac nervous system of humans. This study was initiated to anatomically identify neurotransmitters associated with the right atrial ganglionated plexus (RAGP) of the human heart. Biopsies of epicardial fat containing a portion of the RAGP were collected from eight patients during cardiothoracic surgery and processed for immunofluorescent detection of specific neuronal markers. Colocalization of markers was evaluated by confocal microscopy. Most intrinsic cardiac neuronal somata displayed immunoreactivity for the cholinergic marker choline acetyltransferase and the nitrergic marker neuronal nitric oxide synthase. A subpopulation of intrinsic cardiac neurons also stained for noradrenergic markers. While most intrinsic cardiac neurons received cholinergic innervation evident as punctate immunostaining for the high affinity choline transporter, some lacked cholinergic inputs. Moreover, peptidergic, nitrergic, and noradrenergic nerves provided substantial innervation of intrinsic cardiac ganglia. These findings demonstrate that the human RAGP has a complex neurochemical anatomy, which includes the presence of a dual cholinergic/nitrergic phenotype for most of its neurons, the presence of noradrenergic markers in a subpopulation of neurons, and innervation by a host of neurochemically distinct nerves. The putative role of multiple neurotransmitters in controlling intrinsic cardiac neurons and mediating efferent signaling to the heart indicates the possibility of novel therapeutic targets for arrhythmia prevention. {\textcopyright} 2009 IBRO.},

abstract = {We evaluated a method of baroreflex testing involving sequential intravenous bolus injections of nitroprusside followed by phenylephrine and phenylephrine followed by nitroprusside in 18 healthy men and women, and we drew inferences regarding human sympathetic and vagal baroreflex mechanisms. We recorded the electrocardiogram, photoplethysmographic finger arterial pressure, and peroneal nerve muscle sympathetic activity. We then contrasted least squares linear regression slopes derived from the depressor (nitroprusside) and pressor (phenylephrine) phases with 1) slopes derived from spontaneous fluctuations of systolic arterial pressures and R-R intervals, and 2) baroreflex gain derived from cross-spectral analyses of systolic pressures and R-R intervals. We calculated sympathetic baroreflex gain from integrated muscle sympathetic nerve activity and diastolic pressures. We found that vagal baroreflex slopes are less when arterial pressures are falling than when they are rising and that this hysteresis exists over pressure ranges both below and above baseline levels. Although pharmacological and spontaneous vagal baroreflex responses correlate closely, pharmacological baroreflex slopes tend to be lower than those derived from spontaneous fluctuations. Sympathetic baroreflex slopes are similar when arterial pressure is falling and rising; however, small pressure elevations above baseline silence sympathetic motoneurons. Vagal, but not sympathetic baroreflex gains vary inversely with subjects' ages and their baseline arterial pressures. There is no correlation between sympathetic and vagal baroreflex gains. We recommend repeated sequential nitroprusside followed by phenylephrine doses as a simple, efficientmeans to provoke and characterize human vagal and sympathetic baroreflex responses.},

abstract = {Background. Experimental evidence suggests that autonomic markers such as heart-rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) may contribute to post-infarction risk stratification. There are clinical data to support this concept for heart-rate variability. The main objective of the ATRAMI study was to provide prospective data on the additional and independent prognostic value for cardiac mortality of heart-rate variability and BRS in patients after myocardial infarction in whom left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and ventricular arrhythmias were known. Methods. This multicentre international prospective study enrolled 1284 patients with a recent (< 28 days) myocardial infarction, 24 h Holter recording was done to quantify heart-rate variability (measured as standard deviation of normal to normal RR intervals [SDNN]) and ventricular arrhythmias. BRS was calculated from measurement of the rate-pressure response to intravenous phenylephrine. Findings. During 21 (SD 8) months of follow-up, the primary endpoint, cardiac mortality, included 44 cardiac deaths and five non-fatal cardiac arrests. Low values of either heart-rate variability (SDNN < 70 ms) or BRS (< 3.0 ms per mmHg) carried a significant multivariate risk of cardiac mortality (3.2 [95% CI 1.42-7.36] and 2.8 [1.24-6.16], respectively). The association of low SDNN and BRS further increased risk; the 2-year mortality was 17% when both were below the cut-offs and 2% (p < 0.0001) when both were well preserved (SDNN > 105 ms, BRS > 6.1 ms per mmHg). The association of low SDNN or BRS with LVEF below 35% carried a relative risk of 6.7 (3.1-14.6) or 8.7 (4.3-17.6), respectively, compared with patients with LVEF above 35% and less compromised SDNN ≤ 70 ms) and BRS (≤ 3 ms per mmHg). Interpretation. ATRAMI provides clinical evidence that after myocardial infarction the analysis of vagal reflexes has significant prognostic value independently of LVEF and of ventricular arrhythmias acid that it significantly adds to the prognostic value of heart-rate variability.},

abstract = {The immunological problems of pig hearts supporting life in human recipients have potentially been solved by transgenic technology. Nevertheless, other problems still remain. Autonomic innervation is important for the control of cardiac dynamics and there is evidence suggesting that some neurons remain intact after transplantation. Previous studies in the human heart have established regional differences in both general autonomic innervation and in its component neural subpopulations. Such studies are lacking in the pig heart. Quantitative immunohistochemical and histochemical techniques were used to demonstrate the pattern of innervation in pig hearts (Sus scrofa). Gradients of immunoreactivity for the general neural marker protein gene product 9.5 were observed both within and between the endocardial, myocardial and epicardial plexuses throughout the 4 cardiac chambers. An extensive ganglionated plexus was observed in the epicardial tissues and, to a lesser extent, in the myocardial tissues. The predominant neural subpopulation displayed acetylcholinesterase activity, throughout the endocardium, myocardium and epicardium. These nerves showed a right to left gradient in density in the endocardial plexus, which was not observed in either the myocardial or epicardial plexuses. A large proportion of nerves in the ganglionated plexus of the atrial epicardial tissues displayed AChE activity, together with their cell bodies. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive nerves were the next most prominent subpopulation throughout the heart. TH-immunoreactive cell bodies were observed in the atrial ganglionated plexuses. Endocardial TH- and NPY-immunoreactive nerves also displayed a right to left gradient in density, whereas in the epicardial tissues they showed a ventricular to atrial gradient. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-immunoreactive nerves were the most abundant peptide-containing subpopulation after those possessing NPY immunoreactivity. They were most abundant in the epicardial tissues of the ventricles. Several important differences were observed between the innervation of the pig heart compared with the human heart. These differences may have implications for the function of donor transgenic pig hearts within human recipients.},

abstract = {responses to mental stress in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) are associated with increased risk for subsequent cardiovas-cular events. The integrated baroreflex gain and its mechanical and neural component were estimated and then related to the blood pressure and heart rate responses to simulated real-life stressors: mental arithmetic and public speaking. Eighteen healthy individuals (aged 61 8 yr) and 29 individuals with documented CAD but no other comorbidities (aged 59 8 yr) were studied. Heart rate and blood pressures were continuously assessed before, during preparation for, and during performance of a math task and a speech task. The assessment of beat-to-beat carotid diameters during baroreflex engagement was used to estimate the integrated baroreflex gain and its mechanical and neural component. The CAD subjects demonstrated significantly greater increases in heart rate and blood pressures for the performance of the speech task. However, there were no group differences in integrated cardiovagal baroreflex gain or either mechanical or neural baroreflex component. These findings indicate that the augmented pressor responses in CAD do not result from a generalized arterial baroreflex deficit.},

abstract = {Aims Previous studies showed that autonomic activation by high-frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) during myocardial refractoriness evokes rapid firing from pulmonary vein (PV) and atria, both in vitro and in vivo. This study sought to investigate the autonomic mechanism underlying the rapid firings at various sites by systematic ablation of multiple ganglionated plexi (GP).Methods and resultsIn 43 mongrel dogs, rapid firing-mediated atrial fibrillation (AF) was induced by local HFS (200 Hz, impulse duration 0.1 ms, train duration 40 ms) to the PVs and atria during myocardial refractoriness. The main GP in the atrial fat pads or the ganglia along the ligament of Marshall (LOM) were then ablated. Ablation of the anterior right GP and inferior right GP significantly increased the AF threshold by HFS at the right atrium and PVs. The AF threshold at left atrium and PVs was significantly increased by ablation of the superior left GP and inferior left GP, and was further increased by ablation of the LOM. Ablation of left-or right-sided GP on the atria had a significant effect on contralateral PVs and atrium. Administration of esmolol (1 mg/kg) or atropine (1 mg) significantly increased AF threshold at all sites.ConclusionHFS applied to local atrial and PV sites initiated rapid firing via activation of the interactive autonomic network in the heart. GP in either left side or right side contributes to the rapid firings and AF originating from ipsolateral and contralateral PVs and atrium. Autonomic denervation suppresses or eliminates those rapid firings.},

@misc{Rabinowitz1976,
abstract = {The precise mechanism of the vagus in opposing adrenergic influences on cardiac vulnerability has not been defined. In the present investigation, cholinergic stimulation was produced by administering the selective muscarinic agent methacholine (MCh) and ventricular vulnerability was assessed by measuring the repetitive extrasystole (RE) threshold. MCh produced a sustained 98 +/- 12% (P less than 0.0001) increase in the RE threshold; the increase was abolished by concurrent infusion of atropine (0.2 mg/kg). When MCh was administered during beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol, however, no further increase in RE threshold occurred beyond that resulting from propranolol alone. Infusion of norepinephrine (NE), in a dose insufficient to provoke systemic hypertension, significantly lowered the vulnerable period threshold. This decrease was completely abolished by concurrent vagosympathetic stimulation (VS). It is concluded that VS affects ventricular vulnerability through its muscarinic action and that the protection against VF is in part due to modulation of neural and humoral beta-adrenergic inputs.},

@article{CRICK1999,
abstract = {This study was prompted by the prospect of transgenic pigs providing donor hearts for transplantation in human recipients. Autonomic innervation is important for the control of cardiac dynamics, especially in the conduction system. Our objective was to assess the relative distribution of autonomic nerves in the pig heart, focusing initially on the conduction system but addressing also the myocardium, endocardium and epicardium (see Crick et al. 1999). Quantitative immunohistochemical and histochemical techniques were adopted. All regions of the conduction system possessed a significantly higher relative density of the total neural population immunoreactive for the general neuronal marker protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) than did the adjacent myocardium. A similar density of PGP 9.5-immunoreactive innervation was observed between the sinus node, the transitional region of the atrioventricular node, and the penetrating atrioventricular bundle. A differential pattern of PGP 9.5-immunoreactive innervation was present within the atrioventricular node and between the components of the ventricular conduction tissues, the latter being formed by an intricate network of Purkinje fibres. Numerous ganglion cell bodies were present in the peripheral regions of the sinus node, in the tissues of the atrioventricular groove, and even in the interstices of the compact atrioventricular node. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-containing nerves were the dominant subpopulation observed, representing 60-70% of the total pattern of innervation in the nodal tissues and penetrating atrioventricular bundle. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive nerves were the next most abundant neural subpopulation, representing 37% of the total pattern of innervation in the compact atrioventricular node compared with 25% in the transitional nodal region. A minor population of ganglion cell bodies within the atrioventricular nodal region displayed TH immunoreactivity. The dominant peptidergic nerve supply possessed immunoreactivity for neuropeptide Y (NPY), which displayed a similar pattern of distribution to that of TH-immunoreactive nerve fibres. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-immunoreactive nerves represented 8-9% of the total innervation of the nodal tissues and penetrating atrioventricular bundle, increasing to 14-19% in the bundle branches. Somatostatin-immunoreactive nerve fibres were relatively sparse (4-13% of total innervation) and were most abundant in the nodes, especially the compact atrioventricular node. The total pattern of innervation of the porcine conduction system was relatively homogeneous. A substantial proportion of nerve fibres innervating the nodal tissues could be traced to intracardiac ganglia indicative of an extensive intrinsic supply. The innervation of the atrioventricular node and ventricular conduction tissues was similar to that observed in the bovine heart, but markedly different to that of the human heart. It is important that we are aware of these findings in view of the future use of transgenic pig hearts in human xenotransplantation.},

Examination was performed hourly between 0700 and 2300 h in eight male subjects whose activities and food intake were controlled for 24 h in the laboratory. The respiratory component (0.25 Hz) was greater in the morning than in the late afternoon (P less than 0.05) and decreased 30 min after food intake (P less than 0.01) in the supine position, but it was unaffected by the time of day or food intake while in the standing position. The Mayer wave component (0.03-0.15 Hz) did not change with the time of day, but it increased 90 min after food intake in both supine and standing positions (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05, respectively). These data suggest that supine vagal cardiac control during the waking period increases in the morning and decreases 30 min after food intake and that sympathetic cardiac control increases 90 min after food intake.},

@article{Parsons2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prevention of obesity has focused on childhood as a target period. Our aim was to assess whether frequency of adolescent physical activity affected subsequent body mass index (BMI) gain through to mid-adulthood. METHODS: The British birth cohort of all births in 1 week in March 1958, includes information on physical activity frequency and BMI for several ages, 11-45 years. We examined relationships between activity in adolescence and trajectories of BMI between 16 years (or 23 years) and 45 years using multi-level models. Effects of change in activity on BMI and on change in BMI were tested using ANOVA. RESULTS: Physical activity at 11 years had no effect on the BMI trajectories, in males or females. More active females at 16 years gained BMI more slowly than others, by 0.007 kg/m2/year per activity category over the period 16-45 years, whereas the most active males gained BMI faster than others, by 0.005 kg/m2/year per activity category. This effect in males was not evident on the BMI trajectory from 23 to 45 years. Consistent with these analyses, change in activity was associated with change in BMI in females, e.g. females active at 16 and 42 years gained less BMI than inactive females (2.1 vs 2.5 kg/m2/10 years). Results for males were inconsistent over the time periods examined. CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity may lessen the gains in BMI from adolescence onwards, but relationships vary with age, and in later adolescence show opposite effects for males and females. Decreasing activity between adolescence and mid-adulthood in males, and inactivity in both life stages in females may increase BMI gain.},

abstract = {Many therapeutic interventions in disease states of heightened cardiac sympathetic activity are targeted to the myocytes. However, emerging clinical data highlights a dominant role in disease progression by the neurons themselves. Here we describe a novel experimental model of the peripheral neuro-cardiac axis to study the neuron's ability to drive a myocyte cAMP phenotype. We employed a co-culture of neonatal ventricular myocytes and sympathetic stellate neurons from normal (WKY) and pro-hypertensive (SHR) rats that are sympathetically hyper-responsive and measured nicotine evoked cAMP responses in the myocytes using a fourth generation FRET cAMP sensor. We demonstrated the dominant role of neurons in driving the myocyte {\ss}-adrenergic phenotype, where SHR cultures elicited heightened myocyte cAMP responses during neural activation. Moreover, cross-culturing healthy neurons onto diseased myocytes rescued the diseased cAMP response of the myocyte. Conversely, healthy myocytes developed a diseased cAMP response if diseased neurons were introduced. Our results provide evidence for a dominant role played by the neuron in driving the adrenergic phenotype seen in cardiovascular disease. We also highlight the potential of using healthy neurons to turn down the gain of neurotransmission, akin to a smart pre-synaptic {\ss}-blocker.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Intensive therapy targeting normal blood glucose increased mortality compared with standard treatment in a randomized clinical trial of 10,251 participants with type 2 diabetes at high-risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. We evaluated whether the presence of cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) at baseline modified the effect of intensive compared with standard glycemia treatment on mortality outcomes in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial participants.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: CAN was assessed by measures of heart rate variability (HRV) and QT index (QTI) computed from 10-s resting electrocardiograms in 8,135 ACCORD trial participants with valid measurements (mean age 63.0 years, 40% women). Prespecified CAN definitions included a composite of the lowest quartile of HRV and highest QTI quartile in the presence or absence of peripheral neuropathy. Outcomes were all-cause and CVD mortality. Associations between CAN and mortality were evaluated by proportional hazards analysis, adjusting for treatment group allocation, CVD history, and multiple prespecified baseline covariates.\nRESULTS: During a mean 3.5 years follow-up, there were 329 deaths from all causes. In fully adjusted analyses, participants with baseline CAN were 1.55-2.14 times as likely to die as participants without CAN, depending on the CAN definition used (P < 0.02 for all). The effect of allocation to the intensive group on all-cause and CVD mortality was similar in participants with or without CAN at baseline (P(interaction) > 0.7).\nCONCLUSIONS: Whereas CAN was associated with increased mortality in this high-risk type 2 diabetes cohort, these analyses indicate that participants with CAN at baseline had similar mortality outcomes from intensive compared with standard glycemia treatment in the ACCORD cohort.},

abstract = {AIMS: Increased cardiac sympathetic neuron (SN) activity has been associated with pathologies such as heart failure and hypertrophy, suggesting that cardiac innervation regulates cardiomyocyte trophism. Whether continuous input from the SNs is required for the maintenance of the cardiomyocyte size has not been determined thus far.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: To address the role of cardiac innervation in cardiomyocyte size regulation, we monitored the effect of pharmacological sympathetic denervation in mice on cardiac structure, function, and signalling from 24 h to 30 days in the absence of other pathological stimuli. SN ablation caused an immediate reduction in the cardiomyocyte size with minimal consequences on the resting contractile function. Atrophic remodelling was mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system through FOXO-dependent early induction of the muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases Atrogin-1/MAFbx and MuRF1, which was followed by activation of the autophagy-lysosome system. MuRF1 was found to be determinant in denervation atrophy as remodelling did not develop in denervated MuRF1 knock-out (KO) hearts. These effects were caused by decreased basal stimulation of cardiomyocyte $\beta$2-adrenoceptor (AR), as atrophy was prevented by treatment of denervated mice with the $\beta$2-AR agonist clenbuterol. Consistent with these data, we also observed that $\beta$2-AR KO mice showed cardiac atrophy at rest.\n\nCONCLUSION: Cardiac SNs are strong regulators of the cardiomyocyte size via $\beta$2-AR-dependent repression of proteolysis, demonstrating that the neuro-cardiac axis operates constitutively for the determination of the physiological cardiomyocyte size. These results are of great clinical relevance given the role of $\beta$-AR in cardiovascular diseases and their modulation in therapy.},

abstract = {Background Patients with microvascular angina (exertional angina, positive exercise tests and normal coronary arteriograms) usually have a reduced coronary blood flow reserve. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a potent endogenous vasoconstrictor involved in modulation of coronary vasomotor tone and may play a role in microvascular angina. Methods We compared the effects of NPY (0.2–1.0 pmol/kg, intracoronary) on the vasomotor response of proximal and distal segments of the coronary arteries in 7 patients with microvascular angina, 9 with chronic stable angina, and 9 control individuals. The coronary response to the administration of ergonovine was also assessed in 9 other patients with microvascular angina. Computerized coronary artery diameter measurements were carried out before (baseline) and after the administration of the vasoactive agents. Results Mean baseline coronary lumen diameters were similar in control, microvascular angina, and coronary artery disease patients. NPY constricted proximal coronary segments by 8 ± 2%, 5 ± 2% and 6 ± 3% and distal segments by 14 ± 2%, 11 ± 2% and 10 ± 2% in control, microvascular angina, and coronary artery disease patients, respectively (p = NS between groups). In patients with microvascular angina, ergonovine constricted proximal coronary segments by 7 ± 1.5% and distal segments by 12.5 ± 3% (p = NS vs. NPY). During NPY administration four microvascular angina patients developed chest pain, ST segment depression, and a marked lengthening of the contrast medium run off, in the absence of epicardial coronary artery spasm. Control individuals and coronary artery disease patients did not experience chest pain, ST segment shifts, or lengthening of the run off during NPY administration. Ergonovine administration caused chest pain and lengthening of the contrast run-off, in the absence of epicardial coronary artery spasm, in one microvascular angina patient. Conclusions Exogenous NPY causes mild epicardial coronary artery constriction which is similar in patients with non-cardiac chest pain, microvascular angina and coronary artery disease. Myocardial ischemia and marked lengthening of the contrast run off in response to NPY occurred in microvascular angina patients but not in control or coronary artery disease patients. An abnormal constrictor response to NPY at the microcirculation level could be the mechanism underlying the ischemic manifestations observed in patients with microvascular angina. Condensed abstract (table of contents) The vasomotor response of proximal and distal coronary artery segments was studied in twenty five patients: 7 microvascular angina, 9 chronic stable angina, and 9 control subjects. Computerized measurements of coronary diameters were carried out before and after the intracoronary administration of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and ergonovine. Constriction of epicardial arteries in response to NPY was mild and not significantly different in control, microvascular angina and coronary artery disease patients. Ergonovine-induced epicardial coronary artery constriction was similar to that of NPY. However, NPY caused transient myocardial ischemia in patients with microvascular angina (probably through constriction of the small intramyocardial vessels), but not in control subjects or coronary artery disease patients.},

abstract = {The effect of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) upon ventricular vulnerability was studied in 30 mongrel dogs subjected to varying levels of adrenergic stimulation. Vulnerability was assessed both by determining the minimum current required to produce ventricular fibrillation (VF threshold) and by plotting VF threshold throughout the vulnerable period (VF zone). Chloralose-anesthetized animals were studied by means of sequential pulses applied to the apex of the right ventricular endocardium. Testing was carried out in closed-chest dogs, in open-chest dogs with and without left stellate ganglion stimulation (LSGS), and in open-and closed-chest dogs pretreated with propranolol. In the absence of adrenergic stimulation, VNS was without significant effect on either the VF threshold or the VF zone under closed-or open-chest conditions. During LSGS, however, VNS was associated with a 93 ± 22% (mean SE) increase in VF threshold (P < 0.01) and constriction of the VF zone. Vagus nerve stimulation combined with LSGS raised VF threshold to the control value, but not beyond. After beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol, VNS was without effect on VF threshold in either open-or closed-chest animals. It is concluded that augmented sympathetic tone is a precondition for a VNS-induced elevation in VF threshold. The vagal effect is indirect and is expressed by opposing the effects of heightened adrenergic tone on ventricular vulnerability. IN THEIR CLASSIC STUDIES on cardiac ex-citability, Hoffman, Brooks, and co-workers1-4 found that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) was without significant effect on the electrical properties of the ventricle. Evidence to the contrary has recently been provided by Kent and Harrison et al.5' 6 When the ventricular fibrillation (VF) threshold was determined by means of a train of electrical pulses closely coupled to an antecedent paced beat, it was found that both VNS5 and edrophonium chloride" consistently raised VF threshold in the normal as well as the ischemic canine ventricle. The protection against fibrillation was independent of vagally-mediated bradycardia. Preliminary experiments by our group7 appeared to support the traditional view: we found that VNS had no effect on ventricular vulnerability in the non-ischemic heart. Furthermore, in animals subjected to beta-adrenergic blockade, hypothalamic stimulation,8 and reflex vagal activation by means of blood pressure elevation9 were without effect on VF threshold. In intact animals, parasympathetic discharge does not occur in isolation, but rather concomitantly with activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Vagal effects on such inotropic and chronotropic parameters as sinus rate of the intact heart'0 or contractile force of the isovolumic canine ventricle" are considerably influenced by the level of prevailing adrenergic tone. It may be that differing degrees of interaction between the two components of the autonomic nervous system account for the disparate findings as tothe role of vagal stimulation on ventricular vulnerability. To test whether this is indeed the case, the present studies were conducted under conditions which corresponded to varying levels of adrenergic input: in closed-chest dogs, in open-chest dogs, in open-chest dogs during continuous supramaximal left stellate ganglion stimulation (LSGS), and finally in both closed-and open-chest dogs subjected to acute beta-adrenergic blockade. In these experiments, both quantitative and qualitative appraisal of susceptibility to induce VF was made possible by determining the overall temporal configuration of vulnerability, as well as the VF threshold. Material and Methods Thirty healthy mongrel dogs, weighing 7-25 kg, were studied. The animals were anesthetized with i.v. administration of brevital (5 mg/kg), followed by 100 mg/kg alpha-chloralose. Additional booster doses of 50 mg/kg alpha-chloralose were given as required; a minimum of 30 min},

abstract = {Objectives The purpose of this study was to investigate the independent association between global cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in addition to regional associations of LV dysinnervation and function, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Background CAN represents a potential mechanism in the etiology of nonischemic diabetic cardiomyopathy. Methods Clinical measures of CAN based on total spectral power of heart rate variability and cardiac reflex testing and echocardiographic assessment of LV function were performed in 118 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Systolic and diastolic function were defined at rest and peak exercise using peak systolic and peak early diastolic (Em) tissue velocities, calculated in 6 basal- and mid-segments using color tissue Doppler. Iodine 123-metaiodobenzylguanidine imaging was performed in 33 patients to directly quantify global (heart/mediastinum ratio) and regional LV sympathetic integrity. Results Patients with CAN demonstrated higher resting heart rate, systolic and mean blood pressures, aortic stiffness, hemoglobin A1c, and urine albumin/creatinine ratio, in addition to lower peak heart rate, chronotropic index, and exercise capacity. Diastolic function (Em) was associated with CAN, evidenced by total spectral power (r = 0.42, p < 0.001) and heart/mediastinum ratio (r = 0.41, p = 0.017). Diastolic function (Em) at rest and systolic function (peak systolic tissue velocity) at rest and exercise were significantly reduced in patients with CAN. Furthermore, total spectral power was associated with Em independent of age, hypertension, metabolic factors, and other relevant contributors to LV dysfunction ($\beta$ = 0.20, p = 0.035). Relative regional tracer deficits indicative of local denervation were predominant in the anterior and lateral walls (p < 0.001). Associations with regional Em, independent of global iodine 123-metaiodobenzylguanidine uptake, were identified exclusively in mid-anterior ($\beta$ = 0.45, p = 0.01) and mid-lateral walls ($\beta$ = 0.34, p = 0.03). However, no association was found between regional denervation and systolic or diastolic dyssynchrony. Conclusions The diastolic dysfunction of type 2 diabetes mellitus shows associations with both regional markers of sympathetic integrity and clinical markers of autonomic neuropathy. {\textcopyright} 2010 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {Starting from the late embryonic development, the sympathetic nervous system extensively innervates the heart and modulates its activity during the entire lifespan. The distribution of myocardial sympathetic processes is finely regulated by the secretion of limiting amounts of pro-survival neurotrophic factors by cardiac cells. Norepinephrine release by the neurons rapidly modulates myocardial electrophysiology, and increases the rate and force of cardiomyocyte contractions. Sympathetic processes establish direct interaction with cardiomyocytes, characterized by the presence of neurotransmitter vesicles and reduced cell-cell distance. Whether such contacts have a functional role in both neurotrophin- and catecholamine-dependent communication between the two cell types, is poorly understood. In this review we will address the effects of the sympathetic neuron activity on the myocardium and the hypothesis that the direct neuro-cardiac contact might have a key role both in norepinephrine and neurotrophin mediated signaling.

Adrenergic responsiveness is altered with aging and the age-related changes are limited to the $\beta$-adrenergic receptor density reduction and to the $\beta$-adrenoceptor-G-protein(s)-adenylyl cyclase system abnormalities, while the type and level of abnormalities change with species and tissues. Epidemiological studies have shown an high incidence and prevalence of heart failure in the elderly and a great body of evidence correlate the changes of $\beta$-adrenergic system with heart failure pathogenesis. In particular it is well known that: (a) levels of cathecolamines are directly correlated with mortality and functional status in heart failure, (b) $\beta$1-adrenergic receptor subtype is down-regulated in heart failure, (c) heart failure-dependent cardiac adrenergic responsiveness reduction is related to changes in G proteins activity. In this review we focus on the cardiovascular $\beta$-adrenergic changes involvement in the aging process and on similarities and differences between aging heart and heart failure.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prior experimental studies show that thoracic spinal cord stimulation (SCS) improves left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF). The mechanism of this improvement in the LV contractile function after SCS and its effects on the myocardial oxygen consumption remains unknown.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We performed thoracic SCS (T1-T2 level) followed by 4 weeks of rapid ventricular pacing in 9 adult pigs with ischemic heart failure (HF) induced by myocardial infarction (MI). At 24 hours off-pacing, detailed echocardiogram and invasive hemodynamic assessment were performed to determine LV contractile function and myocardial oxygen consumption. Serum norepinephrine level was measured before and after SCS. SCS was performed on 2 occasions for 15 minutes, 30 minutes apart (recovery) with 50 Hz frequency (pulse width 0.2 millisecond, 90% of motor threshold at 2 Hz output). Echocardiogram revealed significant decrease in LVEF (33.8 ± 1.8% vs 66.5 ± 1.7%, P < 0.01) after induction of MI and HF. Compared with MI and HF, acute SCS significantly increased LVEF and +dP/dt (all P < 0.05). Withdrawal of SCS during recovery decreased +dP/dt, but not LVEF that increased again with repeated SCS. Myocardial oxygen consumption also significantly decreased during SCS compared with MI and HF (P = 0.006) without any change in serum norepinephrine level (P = 0.9). Speckle tracking imaging showed significant improvement in global and regional circumferential strains over the infarcted mid and apical regions, decreased in time to peak circumferential strain over the lateral and posterior wall after SCS, and the degree of intraventricular dyssynchrony during SCS compared with MI and HF (P < 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In a porcine model of ischemic HF, acute SCS improved global and regional LV contractile function and intraventricular dyssynchrony, and decreased myocardial oxygen consumption without elevation of norepinephrine level.},

Some pharmacological data, however, are inconsistent with these conclusions. We have examined the cardiodynamic effects of discrete injections of a ganglionic blocking drug into two fat pads on the surface of the cat heart. These fat pads were shown to contain ganglion cells histologically. It was observed that vagal effects upon cardiac rate are selectively mediated by neurons located in ganglia overlying the right pulmonary veins at the junction of the right atrium and superior vena cava. On the other hand, vagal effects upon AV conduction were selectively mediated by neurons located in a fat pad at the junction of the inferior vena cava and the inferior left atrium. These pharmacological data support the concept that specific intracardiac ganglia are capable of selective control of SA rate and AV conduction. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

Postsynaptic -adrenergic receptor distribution and density can be determined using PET. Multiple imaging studies of the presynaptic component have reported that those individuals with the lowest retention or fastest washout of the radiolabeled analogs have a much greater annual mortality than do those with greater retention or slower washout rate. The results of some studies have suggested that the image abnormalities are better predictors of death than are more common predictors of outcome such as ejection fraction, heart rate variability, and microvolt T-wave alternans.

abstract = {Autonomic imbalances including parasympathetic withdrawal and sympathetic overactivity are cardinal features of heart failure regardless of etiology; however, mechanisms underlying these imbalances remain unknown. Animal model studies of heart and visceral organ hypertrophy predict that nerve growth factor levels should be elevated in heart failure; whether this is so in human heart failure, though, remains unclear. We tested the hypotheses that neurons in cardiac ganglia are hypertrophied in human, canine, and rat heart failure and that nerve growth factor, which we hypothesize is elevated in the failing heart, contributes to this neuronal hypertrophy. Somal morphology of neurons from human (579.54±14.34 versus 327.45±9.17 $\mu$m(2); P<0.01) and canine hearts (767.80±18.37 versus 650.23±9.84 $\mu$m(2); P<0.01) failing secondary to ischemia and neurons from spontaneously hypertensive rat hearts (327.98±3.15 versus 271.29±2.79 $\mu$m(2); P<0.01) failing secondary to hypertension reveal significant hypertrophy of neurons in cardiac ganglia compared with controls. Western blot analysis shows that nerve growth factor levels in the explanted, failing human heart are 250% greater than levels in healthy donor hearts. Neurons from cardiac ganglia cultured with nerve growth factor are significantly larger and have greater dendritic arborization than neurons in control cultures. Hypertrophied neurons are significantly less excitable than smaller ones; thus, hypertrophy of vagal postganglionic neurons in cardiac ganglia would help to explain the parasympathetic withdrawal that accompanies heart failure. Furthermore, our observations suggest that nerve growth factor, which is elevated in the failing human heart, causes hypertrophy of neurons in cardiac ganglia.},

The effect of sympathetic stimulation on responses to programmed ventricular stimulation was studied in dogs without myocardial infarction (Group I: n = 5), with transmural anterior wall myocardial infarction (Group II: n = 6) and with nontransmural anterior wall myocardial infarction (Group III: n = 9). Ventricular effective refractory period during sympathetic stimulation decreased by 16 ± 18, 1 ± 2 and 12 ± 8 ms (mean ± SD) in viable muscle of the inferoapical left ventricle in Groups I, II and III, respectively, suggesting efferent sympathetic denervation by transmural myocardial infarction only. Sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation was induced more easily during sympathetic stimulation in six of the six dogs with transmural infarction, but in only two of the nine dogs with nontransmural infarction (p < 0.01). It is concluded that the partial sympathetic denervation produced by transmural myocardial Infarction enhances the ease of induction of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation during sympathetic stimulation. A similar mechanism may lead to increased risk for lethal arrhythmias during periods of high sympathetic tone in patients with transmural myocardial infarction. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {NEW FINDINGS: What is the topic of this review? This symposium report discusses the evidence for release of cardiac sympathetic cotransmitters in addition to noradrenaline. What advances does it highlight? It highlights the potential role of neuropeptide Y in reducing vagal neurotransmission and directly influencing ventricular myocyte excitability in the presence of $\beta$-receptor blockade. Acute myocardial infarction and congestive cardiac failure are characterized by high levels of cardiac sympathetic drive. In these conditions, sympathetic neurotransmitters such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) can be released in addition to noradrenaline, and plasma levels correlate with infarct size and mortality. Even in the presence of $\beta$-blockers, NPY is able to bind to its own receptors located on cholinergic ganglia and ventricular myocytes. In this symposium report, I review the evidence that NPY can inhibit acetylcholine release during vagus nerve stimulation and limit the subsequent bradycardia. I also present preliminary, as yet unpublished data, demonstrating that NPY may be pro-arrhythmic by directly influencing ventricular electrophysiology. Targeting NPY receptors pharmacologically may therefore be a useful therapeutic strategy both to reduce heart rate and to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of myocardial infarction and chronic heart failure. Such medications would be expected to act synergistically with $\beta$-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and implantable cardiac devices, such as defibrillators and vagus nerve stimulators.},

abstract = {Despite promising results in clinical trials conducted to date, little is known about how cardiac contractile modulation (CCM) mediated inotropic enhancement occurs and how CCM affects the electrophysiological characteristics of the heart. The aims of the present study were to 1) investigate how the stimulation parameters of the CCM signal and the location of stimulus delivery influence the contractile response, 2) characterise the effect of CCM on ventricular electrophysiology, and 3) investigate the potential physiological mechanisms underlying these acute inotropic and electrophysiological effects. Experiments were conducted in isolated rabbit hearts with simultaneous measurement of ventricular contractility and monophasic action potential duration (MAPD). Biphasic square wave pulses were applied to the left ventricle, timed to coincide with the absolute refractory period. CCM mediated responses were assessed over a range of signal amplitudes (2-30. mA), durations (2-15. ms) and delays from the activation of the locally recorded monophasic action potential (0-30. ms). Responses were assessed during Perfusion With The $\beta$1-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol (1.8 $\mu$M) and HMR 1556 (500. nM), an inhibitor of the slow delayed rectifying potassium current. Norepinephrine content was collected and assessed by ELISA from samples of coronary effluent collected during CCM. CCM induced a significant increase in left ventricular pressure (LVP) in a manner dependent upon the amplitude and duration of the CCM signal but independent of the delay of the stimulus within the action potential plateau and was associated with an increase in norepinephrine in coronary effluent (Mean: 46 ± 9. pg/ml). CCM promoted a shortening of MAPD-90% close to the site of stimulation (-19 ± 3%) but had no effect on those recorded at distant sites (0 ± 1%). The increase in LVP (4.7 ± 1.8 vs. 0.7 ± 0.9%, P< 0.01) and shortening of local MAPD-90% (-15 ± 3 vs. 1 ± 1%, P< 0.01) was abolished with metoprolol. Perfusion with HMR 1556 caused a significant inhibition of local MAPD shortening (-27 ± 2 vs. -21 ± 3. ms, P< 0.05). CCM is associated with a shortening of ventricular MAPD in a manner dependent upon $\beta$-adrenoceptor stimulation resulting from catecholamine release, a finding which may be of clinical significance in regard to the development of malignant ventricular arrhythmias.

abstract = {Intracardiac pathways mediating the parasympathetic control of various cardiac functions are incompletely understood. Several intracardiac ganglia have been demonstrated to potently influence cardiac rate [the sinoatrial (SA) ganglion], atrioventricular (AV) conduction (the AV ganglion), or left ventricular contractility (the cranioventricular ganglion). However, there are numerous ganglia found throughout the heart whose functions are poorly characterized. One such ganglion, the posterior atrial (PA) ganglion, is found in a fat pad on the rostral dorsal surface of the right atrium. We have investigated the potential impact of this ganglion on cardiac rate and AV conduction. We report that microinjections of a ganglionic blocker into the PA ganglion significantly attenuates the negative chronotropic effects of vagal stimulation without significantly influencing negative dromotropic effects. Because prior evidence indicates that the PA ganglion does not project to the SA node, we neuroanatomically tested the hypothesis that the PA ganglion mediates its effect on cardiac rate through an interganglionic projection to the SA ganglion. Subsequent to micro-injections of the retrograde tracer fast blue into the SA ganglion, >70% of the retrogradely labeled neurons found within five intracardiac ganglia throughout the heart were observed in the PA ganglion. The neuroanatomic data further indicate that intraganglionic neuronal circuits are found within the SA ganglion. The present data support the hypothesis that two interacting cardiac centers, i.e., the SA and PA ganglia, mediate the peripheral parasympathetic control of cardiac rate. These data further support the emerging concept of an intrinsic cardiac nervous system.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the relative magnitudes of the reflex effects mediated by sensory endings in the left ventricle activated by intracoronary injection of nicotine or veratridine into left anterior descending (LAD) or circumflex (Cx) coronary arteries in the dog. Injection of nicotine or veratridine into the Cx consistently resulted in larger decreases in heart rate, arterial pressure, and in gracilis perfusion pressure than were observed following injection of the same dose into the LAD. Vagotomy abolished the cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor responses to intracoronary nicotine or veratridine. The weight of left ventricle perfused by LAD or Cx was not different (43.5 +/- 1.65 and 44.5 +/- 2.2 g, respectively. These data indicate that chemical activation of sensory endings with vagal afferents in the inferoposterior left ventricle of the dog results in larger cardionhibitor and vasodepressor responses than result from activation of respects in the anterior left ventricle. Further, these data provide strong evidence that these sensory endings which are chemically activated are preferentially distributed to the inferoposterior left ventricle.},

@article{Randall2003,
abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine how neurons within the right atrial ganglionated plexus (RAGP) and posterior atrial ganglionated plexus (PAGP) interact to modulate right atrial chronotropic, dromotropic, and inotropic function, particularly with respect to their extracardiac vagal and sympathetic efferent neuronal inputs. Surgical ablation of the PAGP (PAGPx) attenuated vagally mediated bradycardia by 26%; it reduced heart rate slowing evoked by vagal stimulation superimposed on sympathetically mediated tachycardia by 36%. RAGP ablation (RAGPx) eliminated vagally mediated bradycardia, while retaining the vagally induced suppression of sympathetic-mediated tachycardia (-83%). After combined RAGPx and PAGPx, vagal stimulation still reduced sympathetic-mediated tachycardia (-47%). After RAGPx alone and after PAGPx alone, stimulation of the vagi still produced negative dromotropic effects, although these changes were attenuated compared with the intact state. Negative dromotropic responses to vagal stimulation were further attenuated after combined ablation, but parasympathetic inhibition of atrioventricular nodal conduction was still demonstrable in most animals. Finally, neither RAGPx nor PAGPx altered autonomic regulation of right atrial inotropic function. These data indicate that multiple aggregates of neurons within the intrinsic cardiac nervous system are involved in sinoatrial nodal regulation. Whereas parasympathetic efferent neurons regulating the right atrium, including the sinoatrial node, are primarily located within the RAGP, prejunctional parasympathetic-sympathetic interactions regulating right atrial function also involve neurons within the PAGP.},

abstract = {We have previously shown that direct vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) reduces the slope of action potential duration (APD) restitution while simultaneously protecting the heart against induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF) in the absence of any sympathetic activity or tone. In the current study we have examined the role of nitric oxide (NO) in the effect of VNS. Monophasic action potentials were recorded from a left ventricular epicardial site on innervated, isolated rabbit hearts (n = 7). Standard restitution, effective refractory period (ERP) and VF threshold (VFT) were measured at baseline and during VNS in the presence of the NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NA, 200 microm) and during reversing NO blockade with L-arginine (L-Arg, 1 mm). Data represent the mean +/- S.E.M. The restitution curve was shifted upwards and became less steep with VNS when compared to baseline. L-NA blocked the effect of VNS whereas L-Arg restored the effect of VNS. The maximum slope of restitution was reduced from 1.17 +/- 0.14 to 0.60 +/- 0.09 (50 +/- 5%, P < 0.0001) during control, from 0.98 +/- 0.14 to 0.93 +/- 0.12 (2 +/- 10%, P = NS) in the presence of L-NA and from 1.16 +/- 0.17 to 0.50 +/- 0.10 (41 +/- 9%, P = 0.003) with L-Arg plus L-NA. ERP was increased by VNS in control from 119 +/- 6 ms to 130 +/- 6 ms (10 +/- 5%, P = 0.045) and this increase was not affected by L-NA (120 +/- 4 to 133 +/- 4 ms, 11 +/- 3%, P = 0.0019) or L-Arg with L-NA (114 +/- 4 to 123 +/- 4 ms, 8 +/- 2%, P = 0.006). VFT was increased from 3.0 +/- 0.3 to 5.8 +/- 0.5 mA (98 +/- 12%, P = 0.0017) in control, 3.4 +/- 0.4 to 3.8 +/- 0.5 mA (13 +/- 12%, P = 0.6) during perfusion with L-NA and 2.5 +/- 0.4 to 6.0 +/- 0.7 mA (175 +/- 50%, P = 0.0017) during perfusion with L-Arg plus L-NA. Direct VNS increased VFT and flattened the slope of APD restitution curve in this isolated rabbit heart preparation with intact autonomic nerves. These effects were blocked using L-NA and reversed by replenishing the substrate for NO production with L-Arg. This is the first study to demonstrate that NO plays an important role in the anti-fibrillatory effect of VNS on the rabbit ventricle, possibly via effects on APD restitution.},

@article{Reid1992,
abstract = {The renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the regulation of arterial blood pressure and in the development of some forms of clinical and experimental hypertension. It is an important blood pressure control system in its own right but also interacts extensively with other blood pressure control systems, including the sympathetic nervous system and the baroreceptor reflexes. Angiotensin (ANG) II exerts several actions on the sympathetic nervous system. These include a central action to increase sympathetic outflow, stimulatory effects on sympathetic ganglia and the adrenal medulla, and actions at sympathetic nerve endings that serve to facilitate sympathetic neurotransmission. ANG II also interacts with baroreceptor reflexes. For example, it acts centrally to modulate the baroreflex control of heart rate, and this accounts for its ability to increase blood pressure without causing a reflex bradycardia. The physiological significance of these actions of ANG II is not fully understood. Most evidence indicates that the actions of ANG to enhance sympathetic activity do not contribute significantly to the pressor response to exogenous ANG II. On the other hand, there is considerable evidence that the actions of endogenous ANG II on the sympathetic nervous system enhance the cardiovascular responses elicited by activation of the sympathetic nervous system.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute mental stress evokes responses in the cardiovascular and the immune systems. In particular, the subset of natural killer (NK) cells is found to be responsive to mental stress. The role of beta-adrenergic mechanisms in these processes in the subject of this investigation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Healthy male volunteers (n = 31) were subjected to two consecutive mental tasks. Subjects were randomly assigned to a beta-blocker (propranolol 40 mg) or a placebo group. The capsules were ingested 1 hour before the tasks. The tasks evoked sympathetic responses, as indicated by an increase in heart rate and a decrease in the preejection period. These effects were abolished under beta-blockade, indicating that effective beta-blockade was achieved. In the immune system, significant increases were found for the number of NK cells and NK cell activity in the placebo group; these increases were absent in the propranolol group. In addition, an increase in all lymphocyte subsets was observed in subjects who had ingested propranolol. This increase, however, was also observed in subjects who had received propranolol but had not performed the tasks, indicating that these non-subset-specific increases in lymphocytes were a side effect of the beta-blocker. CONCLUSIONS: Mental stress induces activation of the sympathetic nervous system, with concomitant increases in the number of NK cells in the circulation. These changes were inhibited by propranolol, indicating that stress-induced increases in the number and activity of NK cells in the circulation are controlled by a beta-adrenergic mechanism.},

abstract = {The rich autonomic innervation of the heart plays an important role in modifying cardiovascular function. Recently developed in vivo scintigraphic imaging techniques allow for visualization of the autonomic innervation of the heart. Studies using the modalities have shown heterogeneity of sympathetic innervation in various kinds of pathological conditions as well as normal human heart. The inferioposterior region shows typically less sympathetic innervation than the anterior region. In addition, neuropathic processes appear to commence in inferior-apical regions extending towards the base of the heart. Arrhythmogeneity has been related to the heterogeneous innervation of the heart and heterogeneous uptake of radiolabeled catecholamine analogues, such as I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine, can be found in patients with arrhythmia. In dilated cardiomyopathy, reduced uptake indicates a poor prognosis which allows risk stratification for patients with heart failure. Heterogeneity of the reinnervation process following heart transplantation has also been investigated. Evidence was found of reinnervation primarily in the basal anterioseptal region and to a lesser degree in the inferioposterior and apical regions. Tracer approaches are uniquely suited to identify regionally altered innervation and provide tools for linking information on cardiac autonomic innervation with other clinical aspects.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED We studied the relationship between myocardial [123I]metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) uptake and autonomic nerve activity in normal subjects. METHODS MIBG scintigraphy and power spectral analysis (PSA) of heart rate variability were performed simultaneously in 15 normal subjects. Anterior planar images and SPECT images were taken at five and two points after the injection of [123I]MIBG, respectively. In 10 of 15 subjects, 201TI myocardial SPECT was performed immediately after MIBG scintigraphy. RESULTS The heart/upper mediastinum MIBG uptake ratio in the planar image obtained at 240 min (r = 0.64, p < 0.01) and the washout rate of MIBG in the heart between 15 min and 240 min (r = 0.51, p < 0.05) showed significant correlation with the percentage of low frequency component of PSA (percent LF), an index of sympathetic nerve activity. Regional MIBG uptake in the inferior wall normalized by individual maximal uptake among all pixels was significantly correlated with the high frequency component of PSA, an index of parasympathetic nerve activity (r = -0.58, p < 0.05) and with mean R-R interval in a resting ECG (r = -0.82, p < 0.001) but did not correlate with percent LF, percent uptake of 201TI in the inferior wall or the liver/heart uptake ratio. CONCLUSION These results indicate that myocardial MIBG uptake correlates with sympathetic nerve activity in normal subjects. Our data indicate that heterogeneous MIBG distribution in the left ventricle is a physiologic rather than artifactual phenomenon and may be related to vagal tone rather than sympathetic nerve activity.},

abstract = {The autonomic nervous system plays an integral role in the modulation of normal cardiac electrophysiology. This is achieved via a complex network of pre- and postganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers that synapse on extrinsic and intrinsic cardiac ganglia and ultimately directly innervate cardiac myocytes. Alterations in autonomic tone may induce changes in local cellular electrophysiology that may manifest clinically in a number of ways, ranging from changes in heart rate to changes in heart rhythm. These relationships between autonomic tone and the evolution of cardiac dysrhythmias are areas of evolving research, with increasing evidence for a key role for autonomic ganglia in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation and sympathetic nerves in the predilection toward ventricular tachycardia in areas of myocardial scar. In this review, we highlight what is known about the anatomy and physiology of the cardiac autonomic nervous system, the evidence supporting the relationship of autonomic tone to clinically significant arrhythmias, and a variety of mechanisms (eg, direct ion channel effects) and diagnostic tools that exist to help define this relationship. Further emphasized are potential future avenues of research needed to elucidate the relationship between changes in normal autonomic tone and the pathogenesis of cardiac arrhythmias.},

abstract = {Antiarrhythmic drugs may aggravate or even induce ventricular arrhythmias. This type of adverse reaction is becoming more prevalent as the use of antiarrhythmic agents becomes more widespread. In a retrospective analysis of antiarrhythmic drug action, a worsening of arrhythmia was observed in 80 of 722 (11.1%) antiarrhythmic drug tests in 53 of 155 patients being treated for ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Aggravation of arrhythmias was defined by occurrence of a fourfold increase in the frequency of ventricular premature complexes, a 10-fold increase in repetitive forms, or the first emergence of sustained ventricular tachycardia coincident with time course of action of the particular drug under study. Such aggravation was noted with each of nine drugs tested: quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, propranolol, metoprolol, aprindine, mexiletine, tocainide and pindolol. The frequency of this complication for a specific drug ranged from 5.9-15.8%. Blood drug concentrations were consistently in the therapeutic range. A study of the variability of ventricular arrhythmia during 48-hour Holter monitoring and exercise stress testing in no instance showed arrhythmia enhancement commensurate with that defining aggravation. Our data suggest that this potentially serious complication is not readily predictable and requires a systematic approach to antiarrhythmic drug testing before a patient is prescribed a long-range maintenance program.},

abstract = {Cardiovascular autonomic diabetic neuropathy (CADN) may carry an increased risk of mortality. However, in previous studies the prognosis of patients with CADN seemed to be influenced by life-threatening macro- and microvascular complications which had already been present at the start of the study period. Between 1981 and 1983, 1015 diabetic patients have been examined for CADN (abnormal heart rate variation at rest and during deep respiration) at the Diabetes Research Institute, Dusseldorf. Thirty-five patients (28 with Type 1 diabetes, 7 with Type 2 diabetes) with CADN have been retrospectively recruited and reviewed 8 years later and compared with 35 patients without CADN who were matched for sex, age, and duration of diabetes. Exclusion criteria for entry into the study included severe micro- or macrovascular complications, such as proliferative retinopathy, proteinuria or symptomatic coronary artery disease. During the 8-year observation period, 8 patients with CADN and 1 patient without CADN died. The survival rate estimates steadily declined in patients with CADN over the whole period studied. The 8-year survival rate estimate in patients with CADN was 77% compared with 97% in those with normal autonomic function (p < 0.05). Deaths were mainly due to macrovascular diseases (n = 3) and sudden unexpected deaths (n = 3). One patient with CADN died after an episode of severe hypoglycaemia. Among the deceased patients, coefficient of variation of R-R intervals during deep breathing was significantly reduced when compared with those who survived (1.04 (plus or minus) 0.5% vs 1.87 (plus or minus) 1.0%; p < 0.05), and symptoms of autonomic neuropathy (orthostatic hypotension, gastroparesis, gustatory sweating) were more frequent (7/8 vs 10/27 patients). The mean QTc interval was not different between the groups. These results suggest a relatively poor prognosis of patients with CADN in the absence of clinically detectable micro- and macrovascular complications.},

abstract = {Purpose of Review The present review discusses brain circuits that are engaged by negative emotions and possibly linked to cardiovascular disease risk. It describes recent human brain imaging studies that relate activity in these brain circuits to emotional processes, peripheral physiology, preclinical pathophysiology, as well as clinical outcomes. Recent Findings Negative emotions and the regulation of negative emotions reliably engage several brain regions that cross-sectional and longitudinal brain imaging studies have associated with CVD risk markers and outcomes. These brain regions include the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and insula. Other studies have applied advanced statistical techniques to characterize multivariate patterns of brain activity and brain connectivity that associate with negative emotion and CVD-relevant peripheral physiology. Summary Brain imaging studies on emotion and cardiovascular disease risk are expanding our understanding of the brain-body bases of psychosocial and behavioral risk for cardiovascular disease.},

abstract = {Patients with recurrent unexplained syncope may have cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor responses provokable with head-up tilt with or without exogenous beta-adrenergic stimulation. Although these responses are believed to be neurally mediated, the neural mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Numerous studies have documented peripheral vasodilation, hypotension, and bradycardia at the time of syncope and several case reports have shown sudden withdrawal of vasoconstrictor sympathetic neural outflow to skeletal muscle in human subjects. In cats and rats, a similar response can be provoked with hemorrhage and is prevented by interruption of cardiac vagal C-fiber afferents. In dogs, however, section of these fibers does not prevent the development of a vasodepressor response. The provocation of vasodepressor syncope during nitroprusside infusion in a heart transplant recipient with presumed ventricular denervation also suggests that cardiac afferent nerves may not be required for the development of vasodepressor responses in humans. Other potential mechanisms include release of endogenous opioids or nitric oxide that may inhibit sympathetic nerve firing, and primary central nervous system activation (as in partial seizures) that triggers cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor responses. This article reviews our current understanding of the mechanisms involved in the development of neurally mediated syncope.},

abstract = {The autonomic nervous system (cANS) is essential for proper heart function, and complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias and even sudden cardiac death are associated with an altered cANS function. A changed innervation state may underlie (part of) the atrial and ventricular arrhythmias observed after myocardial infarction. In other cardiac diseases, such as congenital heart disease, autonomic dysfunction may be related to disease outcome. This is also the case after heart transplantation, when the heart is denervated. Interest in the origin of the autonomic nerve system has renewed since the role of autonomic function in disease progression was recognized, and some plasticity in autonomic regeneration is evident. As with many pathological processes, autonomic dysfunction based on pathological innervation may be a partial recapitulation of the early development of innervation. As such, insight into the development of cardiac innervation and an understanding of the cellular background contributing to cardiac innervation during different phases of development is required. This review describes the development of the cANS and focuses on the cellular contributions, either directly by delivering cells or indirectly by secretion of necessary factors or cell-derivatives.},

In conscious dogs with implanted catheters bradykinin (100 ng/kg) injected into a cannulated branch of the left coronary artery induced significant (P less than 0.01, n = 5) reflex increases in mean arterial pressure and heart rate as well as increases in left ventricular pressure, left ventricular dP/dt max. and coronary blood flow. 3. These changes were obtained in the absence of pain reactions. 4. The concept, derived from experiments on anaesthetized animals, that chemical stimulation of the intact sensory supply of the heart always elicits a cardiovascular depressor reflex mediated by cardiac vagal afferents has to be modified, as pressor sympathetic reflexes may occur after an appropriate stimulus to the fully innervated heart of conscious dogs.},

abstract = {The heart receives both a left and right sympathetic innervation. Currently there is no description of an in vitro whole heart preparation for comparing the influence of each sympathetic supply on cardiac function. The aim was to establish the viability of using an in vitro model to investigate the effects of left and right sympathetic chain stimulation (LSS/RSS). For this purpose the upper sympathetic chain on each side was isolated and bipolar stimulating electrodes were attached between T2-T3 and electrically insulated from surrounding tissue in a Langendorff innervated rabbit heart preparation (n = 8). Heart rate (HR) was investigated during sinus rhythm, whilst dromotropic, inotropic and ventricular electrophysiological effects were measured during constant pacing (250. bpm). All responses exhibited linear increases with increases in stimulation frequency (2-10. Hz). The change in HR was larger during RSS than LSS (P. <. 0.01), increasing by 78. ±. 9. bpm and 49. ±. 8. bpm respectively (10. Hz, baseline; 145. ±. 7. bpm). Left ventricular pressure was increased from a baseline of 50. ±. 4. mm. Hg, by 22. ±. 5. mm. Hg (LSS, 10. Hz) and 4. ±. 1. mm. Hg (RSS, 10. Hz) respectively (P. <. 0.001). LSS, but not RSS, caused a shortening of basal and apical monophasic action potential duration (MAPD90). We demonstrate that RSS exerts a greater effect at the sinoatrial node and LSS at the left ventricle. The study confirms previous experiments on dogs and cats, provides quantitative data on the comparative influence of right and left sympathetic nerves and demonstrates the feasibility of isolating and stimulating the ipsilateral cardiac sympathetic supply in an in vitro innervated rabbit heart preparation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

We hypothesize that the individual with a diseased heart has a greater likelihood of experiencing cardiac arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death when the neurocardiac axis is activated. Reviewing possible mechanisms of brain-related arrhythmias, we suggest that the nervous system directs the events leading to cardiac damage by raising catecholamine levels and potentially inducing arrhythmia.},

@article{Herring2012,
abstract = {The autonomic phenotype of congestive cardiac failure is characterised by high sympathetic drive and impaired vagal tone, which are independent predictors of mortality. We hypothesize that impaired bradycardia to peripheral vagal stimulation following high-level sympathetic drive is due to sympatho-vagal crosstalk by the adrenergic co-transmitters galanin and neuropeptide-Y (NPY). Moreover we hypothesize that galanin acts similarly to NPY by reducing vagal acetylcholine release via a receptor mediated, protein kinase-dependent pathway. Prolonged right stellate ganglion stimulation (10Hz, 2min, in the presence of 10$\mu$M metoprolol) in an isolated guinea pig atrial preparation with dual autonomic innervation leads to a significant (p<0.05) reduction in the magnitude of vagal bradycardia (5Hz) maintained over the subsequent 20min (n=6). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of galanin in a small number of tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons from freshly dissected stellate ganglion tissue sections. Following 3days of tissue culture however, most stellate neurons expressed galanin. Stellate stimulation caused the release of low levels of galanin and significantly higher levels of NPY into the surrounding perfusate (n=6, using ELISA). The reduction in vagal bradycardia post sympathetic stimulation was partially reversed by the galanin receptor antagonist M40 after 10min (1$\mu$M, n=5), and completely reversed with the NPY Y 2 receptor antagonist BIIE 0246 at all time points (1$\mu$M, n=6). Exogenous galanin (n=6, 50-500nM) also reduced the heart rate response to vagal stimulation but had no effect on the response to carbamylcholine that produced similar degrees of bradycardia (n=6). Galanin (500nM) also significantly attenuated the release of 3H-acetylcholine from isolated atria during field stimulation (5Hz, n=5). The effect of galanin on vagal bradycardia could be abolished by the galanin receptor antagonist M40 (n=5). Importantly the GalR 1 receptor was immunofluorescently co-localised with choline acetyl-transferase containing neurons at the sinoatrial node. The protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin (100nM, n=6) abolished the effect of galanin on vagal bradycardia whilst the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 (500nM, n=6) had no effect. These results demonstrate that prolonged sympathetic activation releases the slowly diffusing adrenergic co-transmitter galanin in addition to NPY, and that this contributes to the attenuation in vagal bradycardia via a reduction in acetylcholine release. This effect is mediated by GalR 1 receptors on vagal neurons coupled to protein kinase C dependent signalling pathways. The role of galanin may become more important following an acute injury response where galanin expression is increased. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Neural elements of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system transduce sensory inputs from the heart, blood vessels and other organs to ensure adequate cardiac function on a beat-to-beat basis. This inter-organ crosstalk is critical for normal function of the heart and other organs; derangements within the nervous system hierarchy contribute to pathogenesis of organ dysfunction. The role of intact cardiac nerves in development of, as well as protection against, ischemic injury is of current interest since it may involve recruitment of intrinsic cardiac ganglia. For instance, ischemic conditioning, a novel protection strategy against organ injury, and in particular remote conditioning, is likely mediated by activation of neural pathways or by endogenous cytoprotective blood-borne substances that stimulate different signalling pathways. This discovery reinforces the concept that inter-organ communication, and maintenance thereof, is key. As such, greater understanding of mechanisms and elucidation of treatment strategies is imperative to improve clinical outcomes particularly in patients with comorbidities. For instance, autonomic imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system regulation can initiate cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy that compromises cardiac stability and function. Neuromodulation therapies that directly target the intrinsic cardiac nervous system or other elements of the nervous system hierarchy are currently being investigated for treatment of different maladies in animal and human studies.},

abstract = {Microneurography is a method using metal microelectrodes to investigate directly identified neural traffic in myelinated as well as unmyelinated efferent and afferent nerves leading to and coming from muscle and skin in human peripheral nerves in situ. The present paper reviews how this technique has been used in clinical neurophysiology to elucidate the neural mechanisms of autonomic regulation, motor control and sensory functions in humans under physiological and pathological conditions. Microneurography is particularly important to investigate efferent and afferent neural traffic in unmyelinated C fibers. The recording of efferent discharges in postganglionic sympathetic C efferent fibers innervating muscle and skin (muscle sympathetic nerve activity; MSNA and skin sympathetic nerve activity; SSNA) provides direct information about neural control of autonomic effector organs including blood vessels and sweat glands. Sympathetic microneurography has become a potent tool to reveal neural functions and dysfunctions concerning blood pressure control and thermoregulation. This recording has been used not only in wake conditions but also in sleep to investigate changes in sympathetic neural traffic during sleep and sleep-related events such as sleep apnea. The same recording was also successfully carried out by astronauts during spaceflight. Recordings of afferent discharges from muscle mechanoreceptors have been used to understand the mechanisms of motor control. Muscle spindle afferent information is particularly important for the control of fine precise movements. It may also play important roles to predict behavior outcomes during learning of a motor task. Recordings of discharges in myelinated afferent fibers from skin mechanoreceptors have provided not only objective information about mechanoreceptive cutaneous sensation but also the roles of these signals in fine motor control. Unmyelinated mechanoreceptive afferent discharges from hairy skin seem to be important to convey cutaneous sensation to the central structures related to emotion. Recordings of afferent discharges in thin myelinated and unmyelinated fibers from nociceptors in muscle and skin have been used to provide information concerning pain. Recordings of afferent discharges of different types of cutaneous C-nociceptors identified by marking method have become an important tool to reveal the neural mechanisms of cutaneous sensations such as an itch. No direct microneurographic evidence has been so far proved regarding the effects of sympathoexcitation on sensitization of muscle and skin sensory receptors at least in healthy humans. {\textcopyright} 2006 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

Heart rate was kept constant by pacing the right atrium at cycle lengths of 500 msec. Ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured by delivering 350 msec trains of constant current stimuli with a frequency of 100 hertz and 2 msec duration. The minimal current of the train that induced fibrillation was taken as the ventricular fibrillation threshold. In seven animals, the effects of stellate stimulation were studied. Ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured during control periods, after 2 minutes of coronary occlusion, after 2 minutes of stellate stimulation and after 2 minutes of stellate stimulation and coronary occlusion. Coronary occlusion alone decreased ventricular fibrillation threshold an average of 35 percent of control values and stellate stimulation alone decreased the threshold an average of 42 percent of control values. The combination of both these Interventions decreased ventricular fibrillation threshold an average of 63 percent of control values. The effects of stellate ablation were studied in seven animals. Ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured during control periods, and during coronary occlusion before and after stellate ganglionectomy. Stellectomy increased the threshold an average of 31 percent above control values. After stellectomy, coronary occlusion decreased ventricular fibrillation threshold by only 11 percent of control values, a value 26 percent higher than the threshold during coronary occlusion before stellectomy.

In this study, we examine the targeting and trafficking of $\beta$1 and $\beta$2ARs at cardiac sympathetic synapses in vitro. Sympathetic neurons form functional synapses with neonatal cardiac myocytes in culture. The myocyte membrane develops into specialized zones that surround contacting axons and contain accumulations of the scaffold proteins SAP97 and AKAP79/150 but are deficient in caveolin-3. The $\beta$1ARs are enriched within these zones, whereas $\beta$2ARs are excluded from them after stimulation of neuronal activity.

abstract = {The intrinsic cardiac nervous system has been classically considered to contain only parasympathetic efferent postganglionic neurones which receive inputs from medullary parasympathetic efferent preganglionic neurones. In such a view, intrinsic cardiac ganglia act as simple relay stations of parasympathetic efferent neuronal input to the heart, the major autonomic control of the heart purported to reside solely in the brainstem and spinal cord. Data collected over the past two decades indicate that processing occurs within the mammalian intrinsic cardiac nervous system which involves afferent neurones, local circuit neurones (interconnecting neurones) as well as both sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent postganglionic neurones. As such, intrinsic cardiac ganglionic interactions represent the organ component of the hierarchy of intrathoracic nested feedback control loops which provide rapid and appropriate reflex coordination of efferent autonomic neuronal outflow to the heart. In such a concept, the intrinsic cardiac nervous system acts as a distributive processor, integrating parasympathetic and sympathetic efferent centrifugal information to the heart in addition to centripetal information arising from cardiac sensory neurites. A number of neurochemicals have been shown to influence the interneuronal interactions which occur within the intrathoracic cardiac nervous system. For instance, pharmacological interventions that modify b-adrenergic or angiotensin II receptors affect cardiomyocyte function not only directly, but indirectly by influencing the capacity of intrathoracic neurones to regulate cardiomyocytes. Thus, current pharmacological management of heart disease may influence cardiomyocyte function directly as well as indirectly secondary to modifying the cardiac nervous system. This review presents a brief summary of developing concepts about the role of the cardiac nervous system in regulating the normal heart. In addition, it provides some tentative ideas concerning the importance of this nervous system in cardiac disease states with a view to stimulating further interest in neural control of the heart so that appropriate neurocardiological strategies can be devised for the management of heart disease.},

In this study, we analyze the topography and structure of the human epicardiac neural plexus (ENP) as a system of seven ganglionated subplexuses. The morphology of the ENP was revealed by a histochemical method for acetylcholinesterase in whole hearts of 21 humans and examined by stereoscopic, contact, and bright-field microscopy. According to criteria established to distinguish ganglionated subplexuses, they are epicardiac extensions of mediastinal nerves entering the heart through discrete sites of the heart hilum and proceeding separately into regions of innervation by seven pathways, on the courses of which epicardiac ganglia, as wide ganglionated fields, are plentifully located. It was established that topography of epicardiac subplexuses was consistent from heart to heart. In general, the human right atrium was innervated by two subplexuses, the left atrium by three, the right ventricle by one, and the left ventricle by three subplexuses. The highest density of epicardiac ganglia was identified near the heart hilum, especially on the dorsal and dorsolateral surfaces of the left atrium, where up to 50% of all cardiac ganglia were located. The number of epicardiac ganglia identified for the human hearts in this study ranged from 706 up to 1,560 and was not correlated with age in most heart regions. The human heart contained on average 836 +/- 76 epicardiac ganglia. The structural organization of ganglia and nerves within subplexuses was observed to vary considerably from heart to heart and in relation to age. The number of neurons identified for any epicardiac ganglion was significantly fewer in aged human compared with infants. By estimating the number of neurons within epicardiac ganglia and relating this to the number of ganglia in the human epicardium, it was calculated that approximately 43,000 intrinsic neurons might be present in the ENP in adult hearts and 94,000 neurons in young hearts (fetuses, neonates, and children). In conclusion, this study demonstrates the total ENP in humans using staining for acetylcholinesterase, and provides a morphological framework for an understanding of how intrinsic ganglia and nerves are structurally organized within the human heart.},

abstract = {The co-transmitter neuropeptide Y (NPY), released during prolonged cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation, can attenuate vagal-induced bradycardia. We tested the hypothesis that NPY reduces acetylcholine release, at similar concentrations to which it attenuates vagal bradycardia, via pre-synaptic Y2 receptors modulating a pathway that is dependent on protein kinase A (PKA) or protein kinase C (PKC). The Y2 receptor was immunofluorescently colocalized with choline acetyl-transferase containing neurons at the guinea pig sinoatrial node. The effect of NPY in the presence of various enzyme inhibitors was then tested on the heart rate response to vagal nerve stimulation in isolated guinea pig sinoatrial node/right vagal nerve preparations and also on 3H-acetylcholine release from right atria during field stimulation. NPY reduced the heart rate response to vagal stimulation at 1, 3 and 5 Hz (significant at 100 nM and reaching a plateau at 250 nM NPY, p < 0.05, n = 6) but not to the stable analogue of acetylcholine, carbamylcholine (30, 60 or 90 nM, n = 6) which produced similar degrees of bradycardia. The reduced vagal response was abolished by the Y2 receptor antagonist BIIE 0246 (1 $\mu$M, n = 4). NPY also significantly attenuated the release of 3H-acetylcholine during field stimulation (250 nM, n = 6). The effect of NPY (250 nM) on vagal bradycardia was abolished by the PKC inhibitors calphostin C (0.1 $\mu$M, n = 5) and chelerythrine chloride (25 $\mu$M, n = 6) but not the PKA inhibitor H89 (0.5 $\mu$M, n = 6). Conversely, the PKC activator Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (0.5 $\mu$M, n = 7) mimicked the effect of NPY and significantly reduced 3H-acetylcholine release during field stimulation. These results show that NPY attenuates vagal bradycardia via a pre-synaptic decrease in acetylcholine release that appears to be mediated by a Y2 receptor pathway involving modulation of PKC. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The aims of the study were to determine how aggregates of intrinsic cardiac (IC) neurons transduce the cardiovascular milieu versus responding to changes in central neuronal drive and to determine IC network interactions subsequent to induced neural imbalances in the genesis of atrial fibrillation (AF). Activity from multiple IC neurons in the right atrial ganglionated plexus was recorded in eight anaesthetized canines using a 16-channel linear microelectrode array. Induced changes in IC neuronal activity were evaluated in response to: (1) focal cardiac mechanical distortion; (2) electrical activation of cervical vagi or stellate ganglia; (3) occlusion of the inferior vena cava or thoracic aorta; (4) transient ventricular ischaemia, and (5) neurally induced AF. Low level activity (ranging from 0 to 2.7 Hz) generated by 92 neurons was identified in basal states, activities that displayed functional interconnectivity. The majority (56%) of IC neurons so identified received indirect central inputs (vagus alone: 25%; stellate ganglion alone: 27%; both: 48%). Fifty per cent transduced the cardiac milieu responding to multimodal stressors applied to the great vessels or heart. Fifty per cent of IC neurons exhibited cardiac cycle periodicity, with activity occurring primarily in late diastole into isovolumetric contraction. Cardiac-related activity in IC neurons was primarily related to direct cardiac mechano-sensory inputs and indirect autonomic efferent inputs. In response to mediastinal nerve stimulation, most IC neurons became excessively activated; such network behaviour preceded and persisted throughout AF. It was concluded that stochastic interactions occur among IC local circuit neuronal populations in the control of regional cardiac function. Modulation of IC local circuit neuronal recruitment may represent a novel approach for the treatment of cardiac disease, including atrial arrhythmias. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute inferior myocardial infarction (MI) often induces transient sinus bradycardia through vagal enhancement, known as Bezold-Jarisch reflex, which is explained by preferential distribution of vagal nerve in the inferior wall. We examined vagal activity in relation to the occurrence of residual ischemia in patients with old inferior MI and assessed its diagnostic usefulness. METHODS: Exercise myocardial scintigraphy was performed in 15 patients with old inferior MI, 19 angina pectoris (AP) patients with inferior ischemia but no MI, and 32 control subjects who had no evidence of cardiac disease. We analyzed the connection of residual ischemia in old MI with ST-segment response to exercise and with vagal activity as determined by coefficient of component variance of high frequency (CCV(HF)). RESULTS: Exercise-induced percentage change in CCV(HF) was higher in patients with old MI and residual ischemia (18.8 +/- 13.5%) and AP (5.5 +/- 9.7%) than old MI but no residual ischemia (-24.1 +/- 4.9%) or control (-22.8 +/- 4.5%, P = 0.006). Percentage change in CCV(HF) > -5% had a good diagnostic value for the detection of residual ischemia in patients with old inferior MI with sensitivity of 83%, specificity of 89%, accuracy of 87%, and positive likelihood ratio of 7.50, which was higher than that of ST-segment depression (67%, 50%, 56%, and 1.33). CONCLUSIONS: Vagal enhancement was associated with residual ischemia in old inferior MI as well as inferior AP. Measurement of CCV(HF) is useful in improving the diagnostic reliability of exercise electrocardiography in patients with old inferior MI.},

Although it is clear that central command, the exercise pressor reflex and the arterial baroreflex are all requisite for eliciting appropriate cardiovascular adjustments to exercise, this review will be limited primarily to discussion of central command. Central modulation of the cardiovascular system via descending signals from higher brain centres has been well recognized for over a century, yet the specific regions of the human brain involved in this exercise-related response have remained speculative. Brain mapping studies during exercise as well as non-exercise conditions have provided information towards establishing the cerebral cortical structures in the human brain specifically involved in cardiovascular control. The purpose of this review is to provide an update of current concepts on central command in humans, with a particular emphasis on the regions of the brain identified to alter autonomic outflow and result in cardiovascular adjustments.},

abstract = {Efferent sympathetic activities were simultaneously recorded from two thoracic cardiac nerves in 33 chloralose-anesthetized dogs. Efferent innervation patterns were determined by electrical stimulation prior to recording in each animal. One of the nerves selected for recording was shown to innervate the proposed ischemic region, whereas the other nerve was selected because it was shown to innervate nonischemic regions. Left ventricular ischemia was produced by occlusion of a branch of either the left anterior descending (LAD) or left circumflex (LCX) coronary arteries. Heart rate was paced. Cardiac postganglionic sympathetic efferent activities were recorded during a 30-min coronary occlusion in 22 animals. Thirty minutes after LAD occlusion (n = 10), postganglionic sympathetic activity to ischemic myocardium was decreased (84 +/- 5% of control; P less than 0.05) while activity to nonischemic myocardium was unchanged. Thirty minutes after LCX occlusion (n = 12), postganglionic sympathetic activity to ischemic myocardium was also decreased (87 +/- 3% of control; P less than 0.01); however, sympathetic activity to nonischemic myocardium was increased (159 +/- 10% of control; P less than 0.001). Thus, in the anesthetized canine, regional left ventricular ischemia elicits differential sympathetic neural responses that are dependent on the location of the ischemic myocardium as well as the efferent destinations of the nerves. Changes in cardiac postganglionic sympathetic efferent activities are characterized by decreased activity to ischemic regions, with either no change or increased activity to nonischemic regions.},

abstract = {There is continuing belief that cardiac parasympathetic postganglionic fibres are sparse or absent from the ventricles. This review of the literature shows that the supposition is a myth. Early studies considered that fine silver-stained fibres coursing amongst ventricle myocardial cells were most likely cardiac parasympathetic postganglionic fibres. The conclusions were later supported by acetyl cholinesterase staining using a method that appeared not to be associated with noradrenaline nerve fibres. The conclusion is critically examined in the light of several recent histological studies using the acetyl cholinesterase method and also a more definitive technique (CHAT), that suggest a widespread location of parasympathetic ganglia and a relatively dense parasympathetic innervation of ventricular muscle in a range of mammals including man. The many studies demonstrating acetylcholine release in the ventricle on vagal nerve stimulation and a high density of acetylcholine M2 receptors is in accord with this as are tests of ventricular performance from many physiological studies. Selective control of cardiac functions by anatomically segregated parasympathetic ganglia is discussed. It is argued that the influence of vagal stimulation on ventricular myocardial action potential refractory period, duration, force and rhythm is evidence that vagal fibres have close apposition to myocardial fibres. This is supported by clear evidence of accentuated antagonism between sympathetic activity and vagal activity in the ventricle and also by direct effects of vagal activity independent of sympathetic activity. The idea of differential control of atrial and ventricular physiology by vagal C and vagal B preganglionic fibres is examined as well as differences in chemical phenotypes and their function. The latter is reflected in medullary and supramedullary control. Reference is made to the importance of this knowledge to understanding the normal physiology of cardiac autonomic control and significance to pathology.},

abstract = {This brief review describes recent advances in the areas of myocardial receptors that discharge into nonmyelinated, afferent, vagal C-flbers and the regional distribution of sympathetic postganglionic neurons to the myocardium. Complex, nonencapsulated nerve endings discharging into myelinated afferents have been known to exist for many years. More recently, however, indirect evidence for the existence of cardiac receptors that are either silent or exhibit low resting rates of activity, and discharge into slowly conducting C-type fibers, has been demonstrated. The receptors themselves have not yet been identified histologically. Cardiac receptors include subpopulations that are preferenthlly activated by chemical stimuli, including a variety of exogenous chemicals as well as prostaglandins. Another subpopulation is preferentially activated by mechanical stresses in the physiological range. Further investigation may reveal their participation in overall cardiovascular regulation, and mediation of responses to exogenous chemical stimuli. Four principal cardiac sympathetic nerves have been identified in the right thoracic region and three on the left. Most carry sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers. Stimulation of individual nerves, before and after parasympathetic blockade, results in regionally, well-defined myocardial responses.},

Despite advances in emergency revascularisation strategies for myocardial infarction, device therapy for heart failure and secondary prevention pharmacotherapies, mortality from malignant ventricular arrhythmia remains high. Patients at highest risk or those with haemodynamically significant ventricular arrhythmia can be treated with catheter ablation and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, but the morbidity and reduction in quality of life due to the burden of ventricular arrhythmia and shock therapy persists. Therefore, future therapies must aim to target the underlying pathophysiology that contributes to the generation of ventricular arrhythmia. This review explores recent advances in mechanistic research in both limbs of the autonomic nervous system and potential avenues for translation into clinical therapy. In addition, we also discuss the relationship of these findings in the context of the reported efficacy of current neuromodulatory strategies in the management of ventricular arrhythmia.},

abstract = {Endurance exercise training promotes numerous cellular adaptations in both cardiac myocytes and skeletal muscle fibers. For example, exercise training fosters changes in mitochondrial function due to increased mitochondrial protein expression and accelerated mitochondrial turnover. Additionally, endurance exercise training alters the abundance of numerous cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins in both cardiac and skeletal muscle myocytes, resulting in a protective phenotype in the active fibers; this exercise-induced protection of cardiac and skeletal muscle fibers is often referred to as "exercise preconditioning." As few as 3-5 consecutive days of endurance exercise training result in a preconditioned cardiac phenotype that is sheltered against ischemia-reperfusion-induced injury. Similarly, endurance exercise training results in preconditioned skeletal muscle fibers that are resistant to a variety of stresses (e.g., heat stress, exercise-induced oxidative stress, and inactivity-induced atrophy). Many studies have probed the mechanisms responsible for exercise-induced preconditioning of cardiac and skeletal muscle fibers; these studies are important, because they provide an improved understanding of the biochemical mechanisms responsible for exercise-induced preconditioning, which has the potential to lead to innovative pharmacological therapies aimed at minimizing stress-induced injury to cardiac and skeletal muscle. This review summarizes the development of exercise-induced protection of cardiac myocytes and skeletal muscle fibers and highlights the putative mechanisms responsible for exercise-induced protection in the heart and skeletal muscles.},

abstract = {Major untoward events, such as life-threatening arrhythmias and acute coronary events, have been suggested to be triggered by the activation of the autonomic nervous system in patients with coronary artery disease. Analysis of heart rate variability by conventional time and frequency domain methods, as well as by newer methods derived from nonlinear system theory, has offered a novel approach for studying the abnormalities in cardiovascular neural regulation in ischemic heart disease. Heart rate variability has been shown to be altered among patients with ischemic heart disease as compared to their age-matched controls without the evidence of ischemic heart disease. There are also obvious differences in various measures of heart rate variability between patients with uncomplicated coronary artery disease and those with coronary artery disease with complicated myocardial infarction. Impaired high-frequency oscillations of heart rate is the most prominent feature in patients with uncomplicated coronary artery disease, suggesting mainly an impairment in vagal autonomic regulation. Patients with prior myocardial infarction have a reduced overall heart rate variability, and a specific spectral pattern with a reduced low-frequency spectral component has been observed in patients with prior myocardial infarction and impaired left ventricular function. Recent studies have shown that the new nonlinear measures, particularly fractal analysis methods of heart rate dynamics, can detect subtle changes in heart rate behavior that are not easily detected by traditional analysis methods from ambulatory recordings. Patients with prior myocardial infarction have steeper power-law slope analyzed from the ultra and very low-frequency spectral bands, and they also have more random short-term heart rate dynamics analyzed by the detrended fluctuation method. A large body of data indicate that reduced overall heart rate variability is associated with an increased risk of mortality and nonfatal cardiac events in patient with ischemic heart disease. Of particular note, recent studies indicate that fractal analysis methods perform even better than the traditional analysis methods of heart rate variability as predictors of death and the onset of life-threatening arrhythmic events in post-infarction populations. These findings support the notion that heart rate variability analysis methods, such as fractal and complexity measures as well as conventional techniques, give valuable clinical information among patients with ischemic heart disease.

abstract = {91284342 Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia/Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond BACKGROUND. Left ventricular sympathetic afferent nerves are located mainly in superficial epicardial layers. Reflex excitatory responses mediated by sympathetic afferent nerves have been observed during myocardial ischemia in cats and humans but not in dogs. Previous canine studies have induced ischemia by occlusion of a coronary artery. Extensive collateral circulation in the canine heart may limit ischemia of epicardial layers during simple coronary occlusion, resulting in little stimulation of sympathetic afferent nerves and minimal reflex excitatory responses. METHODS AND RESULTS. In anesthetized dogs with sinoaortic and vagal deafferentation, we determined whether reflex sympathoexcitatory responses mediated by sympathetic afferents occurred during transmural myocardial ischemia. Reflex sympathoexcitation was quantitated by direct recording from either efferent renal (n = 20) or cardiac (n = 5) sympathetic nerves. Responses of arterial pressure and efferent sympathetic nerve activity were measured during simple occlusion of the anterior descending artery (LAD alone) and during LAD occlusion with a circumflex stenosis (LAD + CIRC). This circumflex stenosis was adjusted to abolish coronary vasodilator reserve without reducing basal flow. We observed significantly greater reflex increases in renal (32 +/- 5%) and cardiac (58 +/- 15%) nerve activity during LAD + CIRC than during LAD alone (14 +/- 6% and 8 +/- 7%, respectively). Reflex changes in renal nerve activity during LAD + CIRC were abolished by interruption of cardiac sympathetic afferent pathways (n = 5). In eight experiments, myocardial blood flow was measured during the two coronary occlusions. These experiments confirmed that LAD + CIRC elicited more transmural ischemia in the LAD distribution than did LAD alone. However, these experiments also revealed that LAD + CIRC elicited endocardial ischemia in the circumflex distribution. In five additional experiments, regional sympathetic deafferentation of the posterior left ventricle by epicardial application of 88% phenol along the atrioventricular groove had no significant effect on renal nerve responses to LAD + CIRC (36 +/- 5% increase before phenol versus 31 +/- 3% increase after phenol). These results indicate that endocardial ischemia in the circumflex distribution did not contribute to the reflex increases in nerve activity that were noted during LAD + CIRC. CONCLUSIONS. Reflex sympathoexcitation mediated by cardiac sympathetic afferents can be elicited in dogs. However, these responses are significant only during ischemia that is transmural and involves the superficial epicardial layers of the left ventricle},

This 'little brain' on the heart is comprised of spatially distributed sensory (afferent), interconnecting (local circuit) and motor (adrenergic and cholinergic efferent) neurones that communicate with others in intrathoracic extracardiac ganglia, all under the tonic influence of central neuronal command and circulating catecholamines. Neurones residing from the level of the heart to the insular cortex form temporally dependent reflexes that control overlapping, spatially determined cardiac indices. The emergent properties that most of its components display depend primarily on sensory transduction of the cardiovascular milieu. It is further hypothesized that the stochastic nature of such neuronal interactions represents a stabilizing feature that matches cardiac output to normal corporal blood flow demands. Thus, with regard to cardiac disease states, one must consider not only cardiac myocyte dysfunction but also the fact that components within this neuroaxis may interact abnormally to alter myocyte function. This review emphasizes the stochastic behaviour displayed by most peripheral cardiac neurones, which appears to be a consequence of their predominant cardiac chemosensory inputs, as well as their complex functional interconnectivity. Despite our limited understanding of the whole, current data indicate that the emergent properties displayed by most neurones comprising the cardiac neuroaxis will have to be taken into consideration when contemplating the targeting of its individual components if predictable, long-term therapeutic benefits are to accrue.},

abstract = {Stimulation of the left ansa subclavia before and after occlusion of the anterior descending artery of the dog's heart has produced significantly greater ventricular arrhythmia responses in the post-occlusion trials than in trials before occlusion. Data are presented from two series of acute experiments, Series 1 an[@Harrisd Series 2 which include findings from 11 and 16 dogs, respectively. The experiments of the two series differed in types of electrical stimuli used and in elapsed time between occlusion of the artery and the first post-occlusion stimulation. All stimulations were applied when sinus rhythm was complete and no premature beats had occurred within a specified preceding duration. The arrhythmia responses in Series 1 were more intense (except that ventricular fibrillations were equal) and more prolonged than in Series 2. Reasons are discussed but not yet clear. The increased ventricular arrhythmia response persists strongly 5 days after occlusion. Propranolol, 0.5 mg/kg, blocked the arrhythmia response to sympathetic nerve stimulation completely during a period of 45-60 min after injection, but no blockade was apparent after 80 min. Possible mechanisms of origin of the induced arrhythmias were considered and evidence presented to indicate that individually generated discharges in ectopic pacemakers produced the arrhythmia in parts of the records and that reentry was the mechanism in other parts, particularly during approach to onset of ventricular fibrillation. The demonstration that brief periods of stimulation of sympathetic nerve strands to dog's hearts after coronary occlusion can produce ventricular arrhythmias of all degrees of severity including ventricular fibrillation suggests that emotional excitation of a myocardial infarction patient may induce similar ventricular arrhythmias and thereby place life in jeopardy. {\textcopyright} 1971.},

abstract = {Spontaneous activity of 226 neurons was recorded from in situ mediastinal ganglia in 10 dogs. Forty-two percent of these were active during specific phases of the cardiac cycle, primarily during systole. Cardiovascular-related activity occurred when systolic pressure was between approximately 70 and 185 mmHg (1 mmHg = 133.3 Pa) whether the pressure was altered by positive inotropic pharmacological agents or cross clamping of the aorta. Twenty percent of the identified neurons displayed respiratory-related activity which occurred during positive pressure inflation or deflation. Thirty-eight percent of the identified neurons displayed bursts of activity or sporadic activity. The activity of 17% of the identified neurons was altered by gentle mechanical distortion of localized regions of the neck, left elbow, ventral thoracic wall, ventral abdominal wall, superior vena cava, right ventricle, or aorta. In the majority of instances cardiovascular- or respiratory-related activity persisted following acute decentralization, indicating that neurons in mediastinal ganglia can function in the absence of influences of central nervous system neurons. Five percent of the identified neurons were activated by single 1-4 ms, 10-20 V stimuli delivered at 0.5 Hz to the nerves connected with either the cranial or the caudal poles of the mediastinal ganglion or the ansae. These neurons were activated after a fixed latency when 0.5 Hz was used and in most instances when 10 Hz was used. These data indicate that 5% or less of the neurons identified projected axons out of the mediastinal ganglia investigated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Autonomic control of the heart has a significant influence over development of life threatening arrhythmias that can lead to sudden cardiac death. Sympathetic activity is known to be upregulated during these conditions and hence the sympathetic nerves present a target for treatment. However, a better understanding of the anatomy and physiology of cardiac sympathetic nerves is required for the progression of clinical interventions. This review explores the organization of the cardiac sympathetic nerves, from the preganglionic origin to the postganglionic innervations, and provides an overview of literature surrounding anti-arrhythmic therapies including thoracic sympathectomy and dorsal spinal cord stimulation. Several features of the innervation are clear. The cardiac nerves differentially supply the nodal and myocardial tissue of the heart and are dependent on activity generated in spinal neurones in the upper thoracic cord which project to synapse with ganglion cells in the stellate complex on each side. Networks of spinal interneurones determine the pattern of activity. Groups of spinal neurones selectively target specific regions of the heart but whether they exhibit a functional selectivity has still to be elucidated. Electrical or ischemic signals can lead to remodeling of nerves in the heart or ganglia. Surgical and electrical methods are proving to be clinically beneficial in reducing atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure and severe cardiac pain. This is a rapidly developing area and we need more basic understanding of how these methods work to ensure safety and reduction of side effects.},

abstract = {The mouse heart is a popular model to study the function and autonomic control of the specialized cardiac conduction system (CCS). However, the precise identity and anatomical distribution of the intrinsic cardiac nerves that modulate the function of the mouse CCS have not been adequately studied. We aimed at determining the organization and distribution of the intrinsic cardiac nerves that supply the CCS of the mouse. In whole mouse heart preparations, intrinsic neural structures were revealed by histochemical staining for acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Adrenergic, cholinergic and peptidergic neural components were identified, respectively, by immunohistochemical labeling for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), and protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5). Myocytes of the CCS were identified by immunolabeling of hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel 4 (HCN4). In addition, the presence of CCS myocytes in atypical locations was verified using fluorescent immunohistochemistry performed on routine paraffin sections. The results demonstrate that four microscopic epicardial nerves orientated toward the sinuatrial nodal (SAN) region derive from both the dorsal right atrial and right ventral nerve subplexuses. The atrioventricular nodal (AVN) region is typically supplied by a single intrinsic nerve derived from the left dorsal nerve subplexus at the posterior interatrial groove. SAN myocytes positive for HCN4 were widely distributed both on the medial, anterior, lateral and even posterior sides of the root of the right cranial (superior caval) vein. The distribution of HCN4-positive myocytes in the AVN region was also wider than previously considered. HCN4-positive cells and thin slivers of the AVN extended to the roots of the ascending aorta, posteriorly to the orifice of the coronary sinus, and even along both atrioventricular rings. Notwithstanding the fact that cholinergic nerve fibers and axons clearly predominate in the mouse CCS, adrenergic nerve fibers and axons are abundant therein as well. Altogether, these results provide new insight into the anatomical basis of the neural control of the mouse CCS.},

In 20 dogs with a healed myocardial infarction and in 7 healthy dogs a bipolar electrode was chronically implanted around the right cervical vagus. Vagal stimulation (3 ms; 2.1 +/- 0.7 mA; 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 Hz) was performed while dogs stood on the treadmill (heart rate 120 +/- 25 beats/min) and while they exercised (201 +/- 17 beats/min). Gradual increases of the frequency of vagal stimulation gradually enhanced the inhibitory effect on heart rate both before and during exercise. During exercise, heart rate reduction was significantly greater than that produced at rest at any frequency of stimulation (P less than 0.001). This difference widened as the frequency of stimulation increased and the interaction with or without the presence of exercise was significant (P less than 0.02). Vagal stimulation produced similar effects in the seven dogs without myocardial infarction. These data demonstrate that the vagal-sympathetic "accentuated antagonism" described in anesthetized animals is also present in conscious dogs.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of atrial GP stimulation (GPS) on ventricular refractoriness, restitution properties and electrical alternans. Methods: In 12 anesthetized dogs, two multiple electrode catheters were sutured at left and right ventricular free walls for recording. Monophasic action potentials were recorded from six epicardial ventricular sites. Ventricular effective refractory period (ERP), action potential duration (APD) restitution properties and APD alternans were measured at baseline and during GPS. Results: Compared with baseline, GPS significantly prolonged ventricular ERP and APD at all sites and decreased their spatial dispersions (P < 0.05 for all). GPS also significantly flattened ventricular restitution curves and decreased the maximal slope of restitution curves at each site (P < 0.05 for all). APD alternans occurred at shorter pacing cycle length at each site during GPS when compared with baseline (P < 0.05 for all). Conclusions: GPS prolonged ventricular ERP, decreased the slope of restitution curves and delayed APD alternans, indicating that GPS may exert a protective role for ventricular arrhythmias. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {In the present paper we present the outlines of a model that integrates autonomic, attentional, and affective systems into a functional and structural network that may help to guide us in our understanding of emotion regulation and dysregulation. We will emphasize the relationship between attentional regulation and affective processes and propose a group of underlying physiological systems that serve to integrate these functions in the service of self-regulation and adaptability of the organism. We will attempt to place this network in the context of dynamical systems models which involve feedback and feedforward circuits with special attention to negative feedback mechanisms, inhibitory processes, and their role in response selection. From a systems perspective, inhibitory processes can be viewed as negative feedback circuits that allow for the interruption of ongoing behavior and the re-deployment of resources to other tasks. When these negative feedback mechanisms are compromised, positive feedback loops may develop as a result (of dis-inhibition). From this perspective, the relative sympathetic activation seen in anxiety disorders may represent dis-inhibition due to faulty inhibitory mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Each of these processing centers contains afferent, efferent, and local circuit neurons, which interact locally and in an interdependent fashion with the other levels to coordinate regional cardiac electrical and mechanical indices on a beat-to-beat basis. This control system is optimized to respond to normal physiological stressors (standing, exercise, and temperature); however, it can be catastrophically disrupted by pathological events such as myocardial ischemia. In fact, it is now recognized that autonomic dysregulation is central to the evolution of heart failure and arrhythmias. Autonomic regulation therapy is an emerging modality in the management of acute and chronic cardiac pathologies. Neuromodulation-based approaches that target select nexus points of this hierarchy for cardiac control offer unique opportunities to positively affect therapeutic outcomes via improved efficacy of cardiovascular reflex control. As such, understanding the anatomical and physiological basis for such control is necessary to implement effectively novel neuromodulation therapies},

abstract = {Background: The sympathetic nervous system is thought to play a role in the genesis of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT). Left and added right cardiac sympathectomy have been shown to reduce the burden of arrhythmias in the setting of a VT storm. However, the contribution of the right stellate ganglion (RSG) and the left stellate ganglion (LSG) to the innervation of the anterior left ventricular (LV) wall is not well understood. Objective: To evaluate the innervation of the anterior LV wall by the LSG and the RSG. Methods: The heart and stellate ganglia were exposed via sternotomy in pigs with normal hearts (n = 8). A 20-electrode catheter was placed on the anterior LV wall to record activation recovery interval (ARI), a surrogate measure of action potential duration. A microdialysis catheter was inserted in a similar location to sample interstitial norepinephrine (NE) content. ARI and NE measurements were recorded at baseline and during LSG and RSG stimulation. Results: LSG stimulation shortened ARI by 17.1% ± 10.5% (mean ± standard error), while RSG stimulation shortened ARI by 42.1% ± 15.7%, P =.04 (LSG vs RSG). LSG stimulation increased interstitial NE levels by 200% ± 65%, while RSG stimulation increased the NE content by 260% ± 40% (P =.012). LSG stimulation increased dispersion in ARI from 376.0 ± 83.7 ms2 to 1242.5 ± 566 ms2 (P =.03) and caused ventricular fibrillation in 2 pigs. During RSG stimulation, dispersion increased from 419 ± 65.8 to 474.8 ± 81 ms2 (P =.4). Conclusions: Both the LSG and the RSG provide significant innervation to the anterior LV wall as demonstrated by both ARI shortening and NE concentrations. LSG stimulation significantly increases ARI dispersion. This study provides mechanistic insight into the beneficial effects of left sympathectomy and the additional role of right sympathectomy in reducing arrhythmias in patients with anterior myocardial scars and VT storm. {\textcopyright} 2012 Heart Rhythm Society.

abstract = {AIMS: The role of the vagus in the ventricle is controversial, although the vagus can protect against ventricular fibrillation (VF) via nitric oxide (NO). This study aims to determine whether the mechanisms involved are dependent on post-ganglionic release and muscarinic receptor activation. For this purpose, NO release and electrophysiological effects of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) were evaluated in relation to acetylcholine and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). In addition, the role of the coronary endothelium and afferent nerves was tested.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Using the isolated innervated rabbit heart, we measured ventricular NO release using 4,5-diaminofluorescein (DAF-2) fluorescence and ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) during VNS after muscarinic, ganglionic, and VIP inhibition [atropine, hexamethonium, and VIP (6-28), respectively] and after Triton-X endothelial functional dysfunction. The vagal-mediated increases in NO and VFT were not significantly affected (P> 0.05) during (i) atropine perfusion [increase in NO: 196.8 ± 35.2 mV (control) vs. 156.1 ± 20.3 mV (atropine) and VFT 3.1 ± 0.5 mA (control) vs. 2.7 ± 0.4 mA (atropine)], (ii) VIP inhibition-increase in NO: 243.0 ± 42.4 mV (control) vs. 203.9 ± 28.5 mV [VIP(6-28)] and VFT 3.3 ± 0.3 mA (control) vs. 3.9 ± 0.6 mA [VIP(6-28)], or (iii) after endothelial functional dysfunction [increase in NO: 127.7 ± 31.7 mV (control) vs. 172.1 ± 31.5 mV (Triton-X) and VFT 2.6 ± 0.4 mA (control) vs. 2.5 ± 0.5 mA (Triton-X)]. However, the vagal effects were inhibited during ganglionic blockade [increase in NO: 175.1 ± 38.1 mV (control) vs. 0.6 ± 25.3 mV (hexamethonium) and VFT 3.3 ± 0.5 mA (control) vs. -0.3 ± 0.3 mA (hexamethonium)].\n\nCONCLUSIONS: We show that the vagal anti-fibrillatory action in the rabbit ventricle occurs via post-ganglionic efferent nerve fibres, independent of muscarinic receptor activation, VIP, and the endothelium. Together with our previous publications, our data support the possibility of a novel ventricular nitrergic parasympathetic innervation and highlight potential for new therapeutic targets to treat ventricular dysrhythmias.},

Right stellectomy shifted the strength-interval curve 3-5 msec earlier (P < 0.005). In contrast, left stellectomy shifted the strength-interval curve 4-7 msec later (P < 0.001). Thus, right and left unilateral stellectomy produced opposite effects. However, when the contralateral ganglion was removed, right and left stellectomy produced qualitatively similar effects, increasing refractoriness. The net effect of bilateral stellectomy was to shift the strength-interval curve 8-10 msec later (P < 0.001) and this was primarily dependent on left stellectomy. Blockade of vagal efferent activity with atropine shifted the strength-interval curve 3-6 msec earlier (P = 0.001). Removal of vagal afferent activity by vagotomy during atropine blockade shifted the strength-interval curve 2-3 msec earlier (P = 0.03). It is concluded that both stellate ganglia exert qualitatively similar effects on cardiac refractoriness; however, the left ganglion dominates and unilateral right stellectomy produces a paradoxical decrease in refractoriness. The sympathetic effects are tonically antagonized by vagal activity. IT HAS BEEN hypothesized that electrical asymmetry of the cardiac conducting system predisposes to reentrant arrhythmias leading to ventricular fibrillation.'• 2 It is well established that stimulation of the midbrain reticular formation and of areas in the diencephalon and rhinence-phalon produces electrocardiographic changes and a diversity of arrhythmias. 3 "* The rhythm disorders that result from central neural system stimulation may be related to inhomogeneities induced in cardiac excitability. Indeed right-and left-sided sympathetic efferent outflow is distributed to different areas of the ventricular myocardium. 7 Opposite sides of the brain, furthermore, exert different effects on the heart. Thus in the cat. right hypothalamic stimulation decreases T wave amplitude, whereas a rise in amplitude attends stimulation of the contralateral side. 8 In dogs, left stellate ganglion stimulation or right stellectomy prolongs the Q-T interval and increases T wave amplitude. whereas right-sided stimulation or left stellectomy results in Twave inversion without affecting the Q-T duration. 9 It also has been demonstrated that the stellate ganglia differ in their effects on ventricular vulnerability. Ablation of the left stellate ganglion reduces the prevalence of arrhyth-mias following coronary artery occlusion and raises the ventricular fibrillation threshold, whereas an opposite effect results when the right ganglion is removed. sympathetic vagal system profoundly affects ventricular excitability. l2> ' 3 The effects of the vagus, however, are influenced substantially by the prevailing level of adrener-gic tone. 14 ' l5 These considerations have guided the modeling of the present investigation, the aim of which was to define the distinctive effects of the right and left stellate ganglia on ventricular excitability. The specific objectives were the following: (1) to determine the effect of tonic cardiac sympathetic outflow on ventricular excitability; (2) to evaluate the relative roles of right and left stellate ganglia; and (3) to assess the contribution of tonic vagal activity. Methods Thirteen mongrel dogs weighing 16-21 kg were anes-thetized with intravenous a-chloralose. 100 mg/kg. A stabilization period of at least 20 minutes was allowed between anesthetic administration and experimental interventions. Artificial ventilation was instituted using a Har-vard respirator that supplied room air via a cuffed endo-tracheal tube. A polyethylene catheter was inserted into a femoral artery for sampling arterial blood and for monitoring blood pressure. The respirator was adjusted to maintain arterial pH between 7.35 and 7.50 and PO 2 at greater than 90 mm Hg. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37 ± 1°C with a thermal blanket. Systemic arterial pressure was monitored continuously with a Sta-tham P23Db transducer. Mean pressures were obtained by electrically integrating the output of the transducer. Cervical vagosympathetic trunks were exposed bilaterally 2 cm below the level of the carotid bifurcation. Bilateral thoracotomies were performed in the 2nd intercostal space to expose the stellate ganglia. Drugs were administered via a femoral venous catheter.

Moreover, the results of lesion studies suggest left-sided insular dominance for sympathetic cardiovascular effects. It is unclear whether similar representation exists within the human insular cortex. Five epileptic patients underwent intraoperative insular stimulation prior to temporal lobectomy for seizure control. On stimulation of the left insular cortex, bradycardia and depressor responses were more frequently produced than tachycardia and pressor effects (p less than 0.005). The converse applied for the right insular cortex. We believe this to be the first demonstration of cardiovascular changes elicitable during insular stimulation in humans, and of lateralization of such responses for a cortical site. In humans, unlike the rat, there appears to be right-sided dominance for sympathetic effects. These findings may be of relevance in predicting the autonomic effects of stroke in humans and in the explanation of sudden unexpected epileptic death.},

abstract = {ROS Load-free in solution Expansion Contraction Ca 2+ ROS Mechanical load Expansion Contraction Ca 2+ NO Abstract The heart has the ability to adjust to changing mechanical loads. The Frank–Starling law and the Anrep effect describe exquisite intrinsic mechanisms the heart has for autoregulating the force of contraction to maintain cardiac output under changes of preload and afterload. Although these mechanisms have been known for more than a century, their cellular and molecular underpinnings are still debated. How does the cardiac myocyte sense changes in preload or afterload? How does the myocyte adjust its response to compensate for such changes? In cardiac myocytes Ca 2+ is a crucial regulator of contractile force and in this review we compare and contrast recent studies from different labs that address these two important questions. The 'dimensionality' of the mechanical milieu under which experiments are carried out provide important clues to the location of the mechanosensors and the kinds of mechanical forces they can sense and respond to. As a first approximation, sensors inside the myocyte appear to modulate reactive oxygen species while sensors on the cell surface appear to also modulate nitric oxide signalling; both signalling pathways affect Ca 2+ handling. Undoubtedly, further studies will add layers to this simplified picture. Clarifying the intimate links from cellular mechanics to reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide signalling and to Ca 2+ handling will deepen our understanding of the Frank–Starling law and the Anrep effect, and also provide a unified view on how arrhythmias may arise in seemingly disparate diseases that have in common altered myocyte mechanics. Ye Chen-Izu and Leighton T. Izu collaborate in an interdisciplinary team to combine experiments with mathematical modeling for in-depth analyses of the interaction of three dynamics systems – electrical, Ca 2+ signaling, and mechanical systems – that govern cardiac function and heart diseases. Abstract figure legend Surface and internal mechanosensors link to NO and ROS signalling and to Ca 2+ handling. Surface (blue) and internal (red and green) mechanosensors are depicted as springs. In experimental systems where the myocyte is in bathing solution that offers little mechanical resistance, the surface mechanosensors experience little or no strain (change in length divided by original length) as shown in the left panel. The internal mechanosensors experience strain and can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that affect Ca 2+ handling. In other experimental systems the myocyte is adherent to a stretchable membrane or encased in a viscoelastic gel that provides mechanical resistance as the cell contracts or stretches; this mechanical loading causes surface mechanosensor strain as shown in the right panel. In these systems both internal and surface mechanosensors are activated. We and others have shown that this can result in activation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and production of nitric oxide (NO), which affects Ca},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to develop a technique to selectively increase the sympathetic tone to the heart by cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation (SNS). BACKGROUND: Access to the cardiac sympathetic neurons may allow modulating the adrenergic tone of the heart while avoiding systemic side effects. METHODS: Cardiac sympathetic nerves course within neural sleeves along the subclavian artery. Because of this proximity, transvascular SNS was attempted with electrode catheters inside the subclavian artery in 16 pigs. RESULTS: Right/left (R-/L-) SNS (20 Hz) during ventricular pacing at 200/min evoked a >100% increase of left ventricular systolic pressure (baseline: 51 ± 1 mm Hg; L-SNS: 118 ± 26 mm Hg; R-SNS: 116 ± 33 mm Hg; p < 0.001) while systemic vascular resistance remained unchanged. There was a sigmoid dose-response curve with rapid on- and offset of the effect during SNS initiation/cessation. Positive inotropic effects persisted for 12 h of continued SNS (n = 4). Besides positive dromotropic effects, L-SNS/R-SNS yielded a 41% and 77% sinus rate increase, respectively.

abstract = {The autonomic nervous system plays an important role in the modulation of cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmogenesis. Decades of research has contributed to a better understanding of the anatomy and physiology of cardiac autonomic nervous system and provided evidence supporting the relationship of autonomic tone to clinically significant arrhythmias. The mechanisms by which autonomic activation is arrhythmogenic or antiarrhythmic are complex and different for specific arrhythmias. In atrial fibrillation, simultaneous sympathetic and parasympathetic activations are the most common trigger. In contrast, in ventricular fibrillation in the setting of cardiac ischemia, sympathetic activation is proarrhythmic, whereas parasympathetic activation is antiarrhythmic. In inherited arrhythmia syndromes, sympathetic stimulation precipitates ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death except in Brugada and J-wave syndromes where it can prevent them. The identification of specific autonomic triggers in different arrhythmias has brought the idea of modulating autonomic activities for both preventing and treating these arrhythmias. This has been achieved by either neural ablation or stimulation. Neural modulation as a treatment for arrhythmias has been well established in certain diseases, such as long QT syndrome. However, in most other arrhythmia diseases, it is still an emerging modality and under investigation. Recent preliminary trials have yielded encouraging results. Further larger-scale clinical studies are necessary before widespread application can be recommended.},

In addition to sinus and AV nodal function, neural effects on atrial and ventricular repolarization were identified as changes in the area subtended by unipolar recordings under basal conditions and at maximum neurally-induced effects. Animals were studied with intact AV node or following ablation to achieve ventricular rate control. Atrial rate was affected in response to stimulation of all 7 GPs with an incidence of 50-95% of the animals among the different GPs. AV conduction was affected following stimulation of 6/7 GP with an incidence of 22-75% among GPs. Atrial and ventricular repolarization properties were affected by atrial as well as ventricular GP stimulation. Distinct regional patterns of repolarization changes were identified in response to stimulation of individual GPs.

abstract = {Heart failure is a syndrome characterized initially by left ventricular dysfunction that triggers countermeasures aimed to restore cardiac output. These responses are compensatory at first but eventually become part of the disease process itself leading to further worsening cardiac function. Among these responses is the activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) that provides inotropic support to the failing heart increasing stroke volume, and peripheral vasoconstriction to maintain mean arterial perfusion pressure, but eventually accelerates disease progression affecting survival. Activation of SNS has been attributed to withdrawal of normal restraining influences and enhancement of excitatory inputs including changes in: 1) peripheral baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflexes; 2) chemical mediators that control sympathetic outflow; and 3) central integratory sites. The interface between the sympathetic fibers and the cardiovascular system is formed by the adrenergic receptors (ARs). Dysregulation of cardiac beta1-AR signaling and transduction are key features of heart failure progression. In contrast, cardiac beta2-ARs and alpha1-ARs may function in a compensatory fashion to maintain cardiac inotropy. Adrenergic receptor polymorphisms may have an impact on the adaptive mechanisms, susceptibilities, and pharmacological responses of SNS. The beta-AR blockers and the inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis form the mainstay of current medical management of chronic heart failure. Conversely, central sympatholytics have proved harmful, whereas sympathomimetic inotropes are still used in selected patients with hemodynamic instability. This review summarizes the changes in SNS in heart failure and examines how modulation of SNS activity may affect morbidity and mortality from this syndrome. {\textcopyright} 2009 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

However, evidence indicates that the neurogenic control of the heart spans from the maintenance of housekeeping functions in resting conditions to the recruitment of maximal performance, in the fight-or-flight responses, across a whole range of intermediate states.

A massive excitation of cardiac sympathetic afferents, produced by intracoronary injections of bradykinin, also elicits a pressor reflex, without pain reactions. In the absence of anesthesia and recent surgery, the cardiovascular excitatory reflexes, subserved by sympathetic afferent fibers, can easily prevail.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Measures of baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate variability (HRV), and the classical Ewing test parameters are currently used for the diagnosis of diabetic autonomic neuropathy and for mortality risk stratification after myocardial infarction. However, the strengths of the associations of these measures of autonomic function with risk of mortality have never been compared in one study population. Furthermore, no evidence is available on the possible effect of glucose tolerance on these associations. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study population (n = 605) consisted of a glucose tolerance-stratified sample from a general population (50-75 years of age). Cardiac cycle duration and continuous finger arterial pressure were measured under two conditions: at rest and on metronome breathing. From these readings, seven parameters of autonomic function were assessed (one Ewing, five HRV, and one baroreflex sensitivity). RESULTS: During 9 years of follow-up, 101 individuals died, 43 from cardiovascular causes. Subjects with diabetes and low levels of the autonomic function parameters, indicating impaired autonomic function, had an approximately doubled risk of mortality. This association was consistent, though not statistically significant, for all parameters. The elevated risk was not observed in subjects without diabetes, hypertension, or prevalent cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired autonomic function is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Moreover, the results of the present study suggest that cardiac autonomic dysfunction in patients already at risk (diabetes, hypertension, or history of cardiovascular disease) may be especially hazardous.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Downregulation of myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor density does not occur in a spatially uniform distribution in patients with congestive heart failure. Rather, it results primarily from loss of receptors in the subendocardium. In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, beta 1-receptors have been found to be downregulated selectively. These observations suggest that considerable transmural heterogeneity in the distribution of beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes exists in the failing human heart. The present study was designed to test this hypothesis.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We used quantitative autoradiography of radioligand binding sites to measure the distribution of beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes in transmural sections of left ventricular myocardium obtained from cardiac transplant patients with ischemic (n = 13) and idiopathic dilated (n = 12) cardiomyopathy and from 4 subjects with no history of cognitive heart failure. Analysis of radioligand binding isotherms revealed a significant reduction in total beta-adrenergic receptor density in hearts of patients with ischemic and idiopathic cardiomyopathy (20.3 +/- 1.9 and 18.2 +/- 2.0 fmol/mg protein, respectively, versus 40.0 +/- 11.4 in control subjects; P < .01 for both). Loss of the beta 1-subtype accounted for 86% of the total reduction in beta-receptor density in failing hearts. Despite the significant decreases in overall tissue receptor content, the densities of total beta-receptors and beta-receptor subtypes in subepicardial myocytes were equivalent in failing and control hearts. However, in contrast to control hearts, in which the transmural distribution of total and beta 1-receptors was uniform (endocardial: epicardial receptor density ratios, 0.97 +/- 0.14 and 1.0 +/- 0.2, respectively), hearts of patients with ischemic and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy had significantly lower total beta-receptor and beta 1-receptor densities in the subendocardium (ratios, 0.66 +/- 0.06 and 0.46 +/- 0.09 for total and beta 1-receptors, respectively, in ischemic cardiomyopathy and 0.60 +/- 0.08 and 0.52 +/- 0.11 in dilated cardiomyopathy; P < .001 for all values compared with a ratio of 1). Thus, beta 1: beta 2 receptor density ratios were markedly decreased in the subendocardium of ischemic and idiopathic dilated left ventricles compared with control hearts.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: A significant transmural gradient in the density of myocardial beta 1-adrenergic receptors exists in the hearts of patients with ischemic and dilated cardiomyopathy, resulting in a markedly altered beta 1: beta 2 receptor density ratio in the subendocardium.},

abstract = {The origins and organization of cardiac sympathetic postganglionic nerves in the rat were identified in the present investigation. The retrograde tracer, Diamidino Yellow, was injected into the right or left ventricles to label somata in the sympathetic chain. Analysis of all sympathetic ganglia from superior cervical ganglion through the 10th thoracic ganglion indicated that the postganglionic innervation of the rat cardiac ventricles originates bilaterally. The majority of these somata were located in the middle and inferior cervical ganglia (middle cervical-stellate ganglion complex) (approximately 92% of all labelled cells), with lesser contributions from the superior cervical and 4th through 6th thoracic ganglia. To confirm and further quantitate these findings, the middle cervical-stellate ganglion complex was removed (MC-S ganglionectomy) bilaterally or ipsilaterally from the left or right sides, and regional cardiac norepinephrine concentration (left and right atrial appendages and left and right ventricles) was analysed 7 or 28 days later. At both times after bilateral MC-S ganglionectomy, regional cardiac norepinephrine was reduced by 89% to 100%, indicating the removal of almost all cardiac noradrenergic cells of origin and possibly fibers of passage. The results of unilateral MC-S ganglionectomy experiments indicated that the atrial appendages and the left ventricle receive bilateral innervation from the middle cervical-stellate ganglion complex. However, the left middle cervical-stellate ganglion complex appears to contribute a majority of the norepinephrine to the right ventricle. Furthermore, between 7 and 28 days after contralateral MC-S ganglionectomy, atrial appendages, but not ventricles, display significant recovery of norepinephrine content. The present data demonstrate: (1) a bilateral locus of origin of cardiac sympathetic postganglionic neurons, limited longitudinally to cervical through mid-thoracic ganglia, and (2) the ability of the cardiac postganglionic innervation to regenerate after partial denervation. These results demonstrate anatomical evidence for significant bilateral integration of cardiac sympathetic activity at the level of the sympathetic ganglion in the rat. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {Background: The autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays an important role in the initiation and maintenance of atrial fibrillation (AF), and modulation of the ANS function may contribute to AF control. Methods: Anesthetized dogs received either sham treatment (SHAM group, n= 8) or low-level carotid baroreceptor stimulation (LL-CBS) treatment (LL-CBS group, n= 8). The stimulation voltage was set at 80% below the threshold. To simulate focal AF, high-frequency stimulation (HFS) was applied to local nerves during the atrial refractory period. Multielectrode catheters were attached to the atria and all the pulmonary veins to determine the changes in the AF threshold (AF-TH), the atrial effective refractory period (AERP), and the window of vulnerability (WOV) during HFS in both groups. Microelectrodes were inserted into the anterior right ganglionated plexus (ARGP) to record neural firing. Results: HFS induced sinus rate (SR) slowing in the superior left ganglionated plexus (SLGP). LL-CBS induced a progressive increase in AF-TH and AERP at all sites and a significant decrease in the sum of WOV at 2 hours (all P < 0.05). LL-CBS inhibited the ability of SLGP stimulation to slow the SR and the mean values of frequency and amplitude of ARGP neural activity compared with the SHAM group (all P < 0.05). Conclusions: LL-CBS suppressed AF inducibility by inhibiting the neural activity of ganglionated plexuses. LL-CBS may serve as a novel therapeutic modality to treat AF.

abstract = {Background: Atrial ectopic discharges originating in the pulmonary veins (PVs) are known to initiate atrial fibrillation (AF), which may be terminated by catheter-based PV isolation. Because a functional relationship exists between cardiac autonomic effects and PVs in arrhythmogenesis, it has been suggested that discharges of the nerves that proceed to the PVs and interconnect with intrinsic ganglionated nerve plexuses are potential triggers of AF in man. Objective: This study sought to determine the characteristics and distribution of neural routes by which autonomic nerves supply the human PVs. Methods: We examined the intrinsic neural structures of 35 intact (nonsectioned) left atrial (LA)-PV complexes stained transmurally for acetylcholinesterase using a stereomicroscope. Results: The epicardial ganglionated nerves pass onto the extrapulmonary segments of the human PVs from the middle, left dorsal, and dorsal right atrial subplexuses. The left and right inferior PVs involved a lesser number of ganglia than the left and right superior PVs. Abundant extensions of epicardial nerves penetrate transmurally the PV walls and form a patchy neural network beneath the endothelium of PVs. The subendothelial neural meshwork with numerous free nerve endings, which appeared to be typical sensory compact nerve endings, was mostly situated at the roots of the 4 PVs. No ganglia were identified beneath the endothelium of the human PVs. Conclusion: The richest areas containing epicardial ganglia, from which intrinsic nerves extend to the human PVs, are concentrated at the inferior surface of both the inferior and left superior PVs. Therefore, these locations might be considered as potential targets for focal pulmonary vein ablation in catheter-based therapy of AF. {\textcopyright} 2009 Heart Rhythm Society.},

abstract = { The sympathetic nervous system increases heart rate by activating $\beta$ adrenergic receptors and increasing cAMP levels in myocytes in the sinoatrial node. The molecular basis for this response is not well understood; however, the cardiac funny current (I f ) is thought to be among the end effectors for cAMP signaling in sinoatrial myocytes. I f is produced by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide–sensitive (HCN4) channels, which can be potentiated by direct binding of cAMP to a conserved cyclic nucleotide binding domain in the C terminus of the channels. $\beta$ adrenergic regulation of I f in the sinoatrial node is thought to occur via this direct binding mechanism, independent of phosphorylation. Here, we have investigated whether the cAMP-activated protein kinase (PKA) can also regulate sinoatrial HCN4 channels. We found that inhibition of PKA significantly reduced the ability of $\beta$ adrenergic agonists to shift the voltage dependence of I f in isolated sinoatrial myocytes from mice. PKA also shifted the voltage dependence of activation to more positive potentials for heterologously expressed HCN4 channels. In vitro phosphorylation assays and mass spectrometry revealed that PKA can directly phosphorylate at least 13 sites on HCN4, including at least three residues in the N terminus and at least 10 in the C terminus. Functional analysis of truncated and alanine-substituted HCN4 channels identified a PKA regulatory site in the distal C terminus of HCN4, which is required for PKA modulation of I f . Collectively, these data show that native and expressed HCN4 channels can be regulated by PKA, and raise the possibility that this mechanism could contribute to sympathetic regulation of heart rate. },

abstract = {Cardiac sympathetic denervation for intractable angina pectoris in patients unsuitable for conventional revascularization is currently gaining popularity since this procedure may be performed via minimally invasive surgery. A thorough understanding of cardiac innervation and its variations is crucial to successfully effect cardiac denervation. This study aimed to demonstrate the cervical and thoracic sympathetic contributions to the cardiac plexus. The cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunks in 21 fetuses and eight adults were micro-dissected bilaterally and documented ( n=58 sides). The superior cervical cardiac ramus originated from the superior cervical ganglion (present in all specimens) in 53% of cases. The middle cervical ganglion (incidence 81%) gave rise to the middle cervical cardiac ramus in 88% of cases. The cervico-thoracic ganglion (incidence 85%) gave the cervico-thoracic cardiac ramus in 84%. In the thoracic region, four cardiac rami arose from the T2-T6 segment of the thoracic sympathetic trunk. All cervical and thoracic cardiac rami were traced consistently to the deep cardiac plexus. Khogali et al.'s (1999) success of limited T2-T4 sympathectomy in relieving pain at rest of patients with intractable angina pectoris appears to indicate that a significant afferent pain pathway from the heart is selectively interrupted. The variability in pattern of the cervical ganglia, cardiac rami and cervical contributions to the cardiac plexus does not appear to affect the outcome of limited sympathectomy. The complexity of cardiac pain pathways is not fully understood. The study is continuing and attempts to contribute to defining these cardiac neuronal pathways.},

Various cardiovascular receptors were stimulated during reflex inhibition of the central inspiratory neurones produced by electrical stimulation of both superior laryngeal nerves simultaneously, while the afferent input from the lungs was held constant by temporarily interrupting artificial respiration, the lungs being held static in their expiratory position. 3. Reflex cardioinhibitory responses were elicited by stimulation of (a) the carotid body chemoreceptors by intracarotid injections of cyanide; (b) the arterial baroreflex by controlled elevations of the blood pressure; (c) the carotid sinus baroreceptors by raising the pressure in isolated perfused carotid sinus preparations; (d) cardiac receptors by left atrial injections of veratridine, and (e) pulmonary C fibres (including J receptors) by right atrial injections of phenyl biguanide. 4. The effects of single inflations of the lungs on these reflex cardioinhibitory responses were studied and compared with the effects of the various inputs alone. 5. Stepwise increases in lung volume, while having no consistent effect on arterial blood pressure, progressively diminished the arterial chemoreceptor-induced bradycardia to a value of about 7% of the control response without lung inflation. The pulmonary afferents were less effective on reflex responses from other inputs, the corresponding values being: arterial baroreflex, 66%; carotid baroreceptors, 66%, and cardiac receptors, 70%. These effects of lung inflation were abolished by selective denervation of the lungs. 6. In contrast, the size of the bradycardia evoked by pulmonary C fibre stimulation was, on average, unaffected by inflation of the lungs. In some tests the response was actually increased. 7. The differential modulation by lung inflation of these reflex cardioinhibitory responses were the same after upper thoracic sympathectomy indicating that pulmonary afferents and cardiac efferents involved fibres in the vagus nerves. 8. The possible central mechanisms responsible for the differential modulation by lung inflation of cardioinhibitory reflexes are discussed.},

Spectral density plots in intact animals showed three well-defined peaks: P1 (1.5-2.5 cycles/min), P2 (6-10 cycles/min), and P2 (respiratory frequency). In the presence of sympathetic input only the amplitudes of all peaks were decreased; when only vagal input was present the amplitudes of P1 and P2 were increased and there was no change in P3; when neither sympathetic nor vagal input was present the amplitudes of all peaks were decreased. In addition, the amplitudes of P1 and P2 were increased and there was no change in P3; when neither sympathetic nor vagal input was present the amplitudes of all peaks were decreased. In addition, the amplitudes of P1 and P2 were found to be significantly correlated with the mean heart period under the condition of vagal control only. It is concluded that P3 is related to sinus arrhythmia and that P1 and P2 may be related to spontaneous rhythms that are an intrinsic feature of the dynamic regulation of heart period by the vagus system. Sympathetic activity plays no role in the genesis of these rhythms.},

VF threshold was determined by inducing a sequence of early extrasystoles (R/T pulsing). Hypothalamic stimulation was associated with sinus tachycardia, systemic hypertension, and a 40% reduction in VF threshold. The effects of hypothalamic stimulation on the VF threshold persisted when heart rate acceleration and the pressor response were prevented. Cervical vagotomy and bilateral adrenalectomy were likewise without effect on fibrillation threshold changes. However, the decrease in threshold was abolished by beta adrenergic blockade. It is concluded that the reduction in VF threshold associated with hypothalamic stimulation derives from the direct action of sympathetic nerves upon the myocardium, rather than from secondary hemodynamic effects.},

abstract = {ÐThis review focuses on that most engaging feature of the sympathetic nervous system, its rhythmicity. In particular examining the nature of sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), its characteristics, the frequencies of these rhythms and possible mechanisms responsible for their generation. Sympathetic activity can be thought of as a complex output of the central nervous system providing subtle control over end organ function. This control is exerted in a number of frequency bands including rhythms related to the cardiac and respiratory cycles, 10 Hz, and between 0.2 and 0.4 Hz. The generation and control over the occurrence of each of these rhythms is likely to be quite separate. Although aerent feedback from sources such as baroreceptors can explain some of the rhythmical properties in each case there is good evidence for inherent generation of aspects of these rhythms. A variety of brainstem cell groups are thought to be involved in their generation with the rostral ventrolateral medulla, although unlikely to be solely responsible for tone generation, an important regulator of overall activity. SNA also varies in the number of nerves recruited to {\textregistered}re in each synchronized discharge. Little is known about this control other than it appears to be quite separate from the control over the timing of discharges. Spinal cord mechanisms are possibly involved. SNA frequencies above 0.7 Hz do not appear to directly induce oscillations in innervated vasculature, however, are likely to contribute to setting the level of vasoconstrictive tone. Slower frequencies appear to directly cause oscillations in blood ¯ow. #},

abstract = {Afferent and efferent cardiac neurotransmission via the cardiac nerves intricately modulates nearly all physiological functions of the heart (chronotropy, dromotropy, lusitropy, and inotropy). Afferent information from the heart is transmitted to higher levels of the nervous system for processing (intrinsic cardiac nervous system, extracardiac-intrathoracic ganglia, spinal cord, brain stem, and higher centers), which ultimately results in efferent cardiomotor neural impulses (via the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves). This system forms interacting feedback loops that provide physiological stability for maintaining normal rhythm and life-sustaining circulation. This system also ensures that there is fine-tuned regulation of sympathetic–parasympathetic balance in the heart under normal and stressed states in the short (beat to beat), intermediate (minutes to hours), and long term (days to years). This important neurovisceral/autonomic nervous system also plays a major role in the pathophysiology and progression of heart disease, including heart failure and arrhythmias leading to sudden cardiac death. Transdifferentiation of neurons in heart failure, functional denervation, cardiac and extracardiac neural remodeling has also been identified and characterized during the progression of disease. Recent advances in understanding the cellular and molecular processes governing innervation and the functional control of the myocardium in health and disease provide a rational mechanistic basis for the development of neuraxial therapies for preventing sudden cardiac death and other arrhythmias. Advances in cellular, molecular, and bioengineering realms have underscored the emergence of this area as an important avenue of scientific inquiry and therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The extent and locations of intrinsic cardiac ganglia on the human heart were investigated to facilitate studying their function. METHODS: The locations and number of major intrinsic cardiac ganglia were determined in six human hearts by means of microdissection following methylene blue staining. Light and electron microscopic analyses were performed on right atrial and cranial medial ventricular ganglia obtained from 12 other human hearts. RESULTS: Gross anatomy: Collections of ganglia associated with nerves, i.e., ganglionated plexuses, were observed consistently in five atrial and five ventricular regions. Occasional ganglia were located in other atrial and ventricular regions. Atrial ganglionated plexuses were identified on 1) the superior surface of the right atrium, 2) the superior surface of the left atrium, 3) the posterior surface of the right atrium, 4) the posterior medial surface of the left atrium (the latter two fuse medially where they extend anteriorly into the interatrial septum), and 5) the inferior and lateral aspect of the posterior left atrium. Ventricular ganglionated plexuses were located in fat 1) surrounding the aortic root, 2) at the origins of the right and left coronary arteries (the latter extending to the origins of the left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries), 3) at the origin of the posterior descending coronary artery, 4) adjacent to the origin of the right acute marginal coronary artery, and 5) at the origin of the left obtuse marginal coronary artery. Microscopic anatomy: Ganglia ranged in size from those containing a few neurons to large ganglia measuring up to 0.5 x 1 mm. The human heart is estimated to contain more than 14,000 neurons. Neuronal somata varied in size and shape. Many axon terminals in intrinsic cardiac ganglia contained large numbers of small, clear, round vesicles that formed asymmetrical axodendritic synapses, whereas a few axons contained large, dense-cored vesicles. CONCLUSIONS: The human intrinsic cardiac nervous system is distributed more extensively than was considered previously, most of its ganglia being located on the posterior surfaces of the atria and superior aspect of the ventricles. Each ganglion therein contains a variety of neurons that are associated with complex synaptology.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Anatomical Society. The rabbit is widely used in experimental cardiac physiology, but the neuroanatomy of the rabbit heart remains insufficiently examined. This study aimed to ascertain the architecture of the intrinsic nerve plexus in the walls and septum of rabbit cardiac ventricles. In 51 rabbit hearts, a combined approach involving: (i) histochemical acetylcholinesterase staining of intrinsic neural structures in total cardiac ventricles; (ii) immunofluorescent labelling of intrinsic nerves, nerve fibres (NFs) and neuronal somata (NS); and (iii) transmission electron microscopy of intrinsic ventricular nerves and NFs was used. Mediastinal nerves access the ventral and lateral surfaces of both ventricles at a restricted site between the root of the ascending aorta and the pulmonary trunk. The dorsal surface of both ventricles is supplied by several epicardial nerves extending from the left dorsal ganglionated nerve subplexus on the dorsal left atrium. Ventral accessing nerves are thicker and more numerous than dorsal nerves. Intrinsic ventricular NS are rare on the conus arteriosus and the root of the pulmonary trunk. The number of ventricular NS ranged from 11 to 220 per heart. Four chemical phenotypes of NS within ventricular ganglia were identified, i.e. ganglionic cells positive for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and biphenotypic, i.e. positive for both ChAT/nNOS and for ChAT/tyrosine hydroxylase. Clusters of small intensely fluorescent cells are distributed within or close to ganglia on the root of the pulmonary trunk, but not on the conus arteriosus. The largest and most numerous intrinsic nerves proceed within the epicardium. Scarce nerves were found near myocardial blood vessels, but the myocardium contained only a scarce meshwork of NFs. In the endocardium, large numbers of thin nerves and NFs proceed along the bundle of His and both its branches up to the apex of the ventricles. The endocardial meshwork of fine NFs was approximately eight times denser than the myocardial meshwork. Adrenergic NFs predominate considerably in all layers of the ventricular walls and septum, whereas NFs of other neurochemical phenotypes were in the minority and their amount differed between the epicardium, myocardium and endocardium. The densities of NFs positive for nNOS and ChAT were similar in the epicardium and endocardium, but NFs positive for nNOS in the myocardium were eight times more abundant than NFs positive for ChAT. Potentially sensory NFs positive for both calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P were sparse in the myocardial layer, but numerous in epicardial nerves and particularly abundant within the endocardium. Electron microscopic observations demonstrate that intrinsic ventricular nerves have a distinctive morphology, which may be attributed to remodelling of the peripheral nerves after their access into the ventricular wall. In conclusion, the rabbit ventricles display complex structural organization of intrinsic ventricular nerves, NFs and ganglionic cells. The results provide a basic anatomical background for further functional analysis of the intrinsic nervous system in the cardiac ventricles.},

@article{Armour1994,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine the capacity of nodose ganglion afferent neurones with epicardial sensory endings to respond to mechanical and chemical stimuli, in particular to purinergic compounds.\n\nMETHODS: Alterations in spontaneous activity generated by epicardial afferent neurones in nodose ganglia in situ of 17 anaesthetised dogs were identified using extracellular recording techniques when mechanical and chemical stimuli were applied to their receptor fields, as well as during brief periods of coronary artery occlusion.\n\nRESULTS: 92 cardiac afferent neurones were identified. Localised epicardial distortion modified the activity generated by 34 neurones [0.19(SEM 0.02) to 1.2(0.4) impulses.s-1]. Application of bradykinin, substance P, N6-cyclopentyladenosine or beta, gamma-methylene adenosine 5'-triphosphate to localised epicardial fields altered the activity of 69 neurones. Thus the majority of identified epicardial neurones responded to chemical stimuli alone (63%) as opposed to mechanical stimuli alone (25%), 12% responding to both types of stimuli. Activity was enhanced overall by chemical stimuli from a mean range of 0.1-0.4 to 11.6-13.2 impulses.s-1. Following termination of short lasting chemical as opposed to mechanical stimuli, activity remained increased for up to 45 min. Activity generated by 16 chemosensitive neurones was modified by brief periods of coronary artery occlusion [0.26(0.12)-1.66(0.61) impulses.s-1]; activity increasing further [2.51(0.47) impulses.s-1] during reperfusion periods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: (1) Chemical stimuli induce an order magnitude greater enhancement of activity generated by nodose ganglion cardiac afferent neurones than do mechanical stimuli, such enhancement persisting long after removal of chemical as opposed to mechanical stimuli. Thus qualitative and quantitative differences exists between central neuronal inputs derived from nodose ganglion epicardial afferent neurones sensitive to chemical as opposed to mechanical stimuli. (2) Adenosine and ATP can activate nodose ganglion cardiac afferent neurones.},

@article{Ajijola2015a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors. Modulation of human cardiac mechanical and electrophysiologic function by direct s tellate ganglion stimulation has not been performed. Our aim was to assess the effect of low-level left stellate ganglion (LSG) stimulation (SGS) on arrhythmias, hemodynamic, and cardiac electrophysiological indices. Patients undergoing ablation procedures for arrhythmias were recruited for SGS. A stimulating electrode was placed next to the LSG under fluoroscopy and ultrasound imaging; and SGS (5–10 Hz, 10–20 mA) was performed. We measured hemodynamic, intracardiac and ECG parameters, and activation recovery intervals (ARIs) (surrogate for action potential duration) from a duodecapolar catheter in the right ventricular outflow tract. Five patients underwent SGS (3 males, 45 ± 20 years). Stimulating catheter placement was successful, and without complication in all patients. SGS did not change heart rate, but increased mean arterial blood pressure (78 ± 3 mmHg to 98 ± 5 mmHg, P < 0.001) and dP/dt max (1148 ± 244 mmHg/sec to 1645 ± 493 mmHg/sec, P = 0.03). SGS shortened mean ARI from 304 ± 23 msec to 283 ± 17 msec (P < 0.001), although one patient required parasympathetic blockade. Dispersion of repolarization (DOR) increased in four patients and decreased in one, consistent with animal models. QT interval, T-wave duration and amplitude at baseline and with SGS were 415 ± 15 msec versus 399 ± 15 msec (P < 0.001); 201 ± 12 msec versus 230 ± 28 msec; and 0.2 ± 0.09 mV versus 0.22 ± 0.08 mV, respectively. At the level of SGS performed, no increase in arrhythmias was seen. Percutaneous low-level SGS shortens ARI in the RVOT, and increases blood pressure and LV contractility. These observations demonstrate feasibility of percutaneous SGS in humans.},

abstract = {Physiological studies have long documented the key role played by the autonomic nervous system in modulating cardiovascular functions and in controlling blood pressure values, both at rest and in response to environmental stimuli. Experimental and clinical investigations have tested the hypothesis that the origin, progression, and outcome of human hypertension are related to dysfunctional autonomic cardiovascular control and especially to abnormal activation of the sympathetic division. Here, we review the recent literature on the adrenergic and vagal abnormalities that have been reported in essential hypertension, with emphasis on their role as promoters and as amplifiers of the high blood pressure state. We also discuss the possible mechanisms underlying these abnormalities and their importance in the development and progression of the structural and functional cardiovascular damage that characterizes hypertension. Finally, we examine the modifications of sympathetic and vagal cardiovascular influences induced by current nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions aimed at correcting elevations in blood pressure and restoring the normotensive state.},

@article{Allen1987,
abstract = {1. The electrophysiological properties of intracardiac neurones cultured from ganglia within the atria and interatrial septum of the new-born guinea-pig heart were studied using intracellular micro-electrodes. 2. Three types of neurones with resting membrane potentials in the range -45 to -76 mV were detected. The first type, AHs cells, had high (15-28 mV) firing thresholds, pronounced slow post-spike after-hyperpolarizations and fired only once to prolonged intrasomal current injection. The second type, AHm cells, were similar to AHs cells, except that they could fire short bursts of spikes (100-400 ms) at the onset of current injection. The third type, M cells, had low firing thresholds (10-15 mV), no slow after-hyperpolarizations and produced non-adapting trains of action potentials in response to depolarizing current injection. 3. The generation of action potentials in M cells was prevented by tetrodotoxin (TTX; 0.3 microM), whereas in AHs and AHm cells action potentials displayed a channel blockade using solutions containing the divalent cations cadmium, cobalt or manganese (0.02-1 mM). 4. The post-spike after-hyperpolarization in AHs and AHm cells was abolished by the removal of extracellular calcium, shortened in solutions containing the calcium entry blockers CdCl2, MnSO4 and CoCl2 (0.02-1 mM) and prolonged by the addition of calcium (5.0 mM), tetraethylammonium (1-3 mM), 4-aminopyridine (1-3 mM), cyanide (10 microM) or caffeine (100 microM) to the perfusate. 5. The reversal potential of the post-spike after-hyperpolarization was -89.1 mV. This value changed by 62.9 mV for a 10-fold increase in extracellular potassium concentration. 6. The peak conductance change during the post-spike after-hyperpolarization (gK,Ca), was largely independent of membrane potential between -50 and -110 mV. The peak increase in gK,Ca and the duration of the after-hyperpolarization increased with the number of spikes preceding it. 7. It is concluded that calcium entry during the action potential is responsible for the activation of an outward potassium current in the two types of AH cells; the roles played by intracellular calcium extrusion as well as sequestration mechanisms in the generation of the response are discussed.},
