abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sex and age have long been known to affect the ECG. Several biologic variables and anatomic factors may contribute to sex and age-related differences on the ECG. We hypothesized that a convolutional neural network (CNN) could be trained through a process called deep learning to predict a person's age and self-reported sex using only 12-lead ECG signals. We further hypothesized that discrepancies between CNN-predicted age and chronological age may serve as a physiological measure of health. METHODS: We trained CNNs using 10-second samples of 12-lead ECG signals from 499 727 patients to predict sex and age. The networks were tested on a separate cohort of 275 056 patients. Subsequently, 100 randomly selected patients with multiple ECGs over the course of decades were identified to assess within-individual accuracy of CNN age estimation. RESULTS: Of 275 056 patients tested, 52{\%} were males and mean age was 58.6±16.2 years. For sex classification, the model obtained 90.4{\%} classification accuracy with an area under the curve of 0.97 in the independent test data. Age was estimated as a continuous variable with an average error of 6.9±5.6 years (R-squared =0.7). Among 100 patients with multiple ECGs over the course of at least 2 decades of life, most patients (51{\%}) had an average error between real age and CNN-predicted age of {\textless}7 years. Major factors seen among patients with a CNN-predicted age that exceeded chronologic age by {\textgreater}7 years included: low ejection fraction, hypertension, and coronary disease (P{\textless}0.01). In the 27{\%} of patients where correlation was {\textgreater}0.8 between CNN-predicted and chronologic age, no incident events occurred over follow-up (33±12 years). CONCLUSIONS: Applying artificial intelligence to the ECG allows prediction of patient sex and estimation of age. The ability of an artificial intelligence algorithm to determine physiological age, with further validation, may serve as a measure of overall health.},

abstract = {The spectrum of frequencies producing the QRS complex has not been fully explored. In this manuscript we review previous studies of QRS frequency content, and discuss our novel method of the conjoint analysis of the ECG signal in six dimensions: in the domain of three space dimensions, in time domain, and in frequency domain. Orbital frequency of QRS loop is introduced as a six-dimensional characteristic of ventricular conduction, which helped to reveal inapparent ventricular conduction, and to characterize electrophysiological substrate. In this paper, we review our novel method in the historical context.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ECG remains the most widely used diagnostic test for characterization of cardiac structure and electrical activity. We hypothesized that parallel advances in computing power, machine learning algorithms, and availability of large-scale data could substantially expand the clinical inferences derived from the ECG while at the same time preserving interpretability for medical decision-making. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified 36 186 ECGs from the University of California, San Francisco database that would enable training of models for estimation of cardiac structure or function or detection of disease. We segmented the ECG into standard component waveforms and intervals using a novel combination of convolutional neural networks and hidden Markov models and evaluated this segmentation by comparing resulting electrical intervals against 141 864 measurements produced during the clinical workflow. We then built a patient-level ECG profile, a 725-element feature vector and used this profile to train and interpret machine learning models for examples of cardiac structure (left ventricular mass, left atrial volume, and mitral annulus e-prime) and disease (pulmonary arterial hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloid, and mitral valve prolapse). ECG measurements derived from the convolutional neural network-hidden Markov model segmentation agreed with clinical estimates, with median absolute deviations as a fraction of observed value of 0.6{\%} for heart rate and 4{\%} for QT interval. Models trained using patient-level ECG profiles enabled surprising quantitative estimates of left ventricular mass and mitral annulus e' velocity (median absolute deviation of 16{\%} and 19{\%}, respectively) with good discrimination for left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction as binary traits. Model performance using our approach for disease detection demonstrated areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.94 for pulmonary arterial hypertension, 0.91 for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 0.86 for cardiac amyloid, and 0.77 for mitral valve prolapse. CONCLUSIONS: Modern machine learning methods can extend the 12-lead ECG to quantitative applications well beyond its current uses while preserving the transparency that is so fundamental to clinical care.},
