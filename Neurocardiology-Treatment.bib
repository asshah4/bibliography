abstract = {We tested the hypotheses that (1) progression of coronary artery disease (CAD) increases sympathetic inflow to the heart, thus impairing cardiac blood supply, and (2) reduced sympathetic tone improves cardiac microcirculation and ameliorates severity of anginal symptoms. Electrical irritation of the nerve auricularis-a sensitive ramus of the vagus nerve-provides a central sympatholytic action. Using this technique, we studied the effects of vagal neurostimulation (VNS) on hemodynamics, the content of atrial noradrenergic nerves and the microcirculatory bed of CAD patients. VNS was performed in the preoperative period of CAD patients with severe angina pectoris. The comparison groups consisted of untreated patients with CAD or Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Atrial tissue of patients with this syndrome (n=6); with effort angina (n=14); with angina at rest (n=10); and with severe angina treated with VNS (n=8) contained the following volume percentages of noradrenergic nerves: 1.7±0.1{\%}, 1.3±0.3{\%}, 0.5±0.1{\%} (p{\textless}0.05 vs. the other groups) and 1.3±0.2{\%}, respectively. In these groups, cardiac microcirculatory vessels (diameter, 10-20 $\mu$m) had the following densities: 2.7±0.2{\%}, 3.4±0.2{\%}, 2.0±0.4{\%} (p{\textless}0.05 vs. the other groups) and 3.3±0.3{\%}, respectively. VNS treatment abolished angina at rest, decreased heart rate and blood pressure. It improved left ventricular ejection fraction from 50±1.5{\%} to 58±1.0{\%} (p{\textless}0.05), also changing left ventricular diastolic filling. The ratio of time velocity integrals of the early (Ei) to late (Ai) waves increased from 1.07±0.12 to 1.65±0.17 after VNS (p{\textless}0.05). In electrocardiograms of VNS-treated patients, QRS- and QT-duration were shortened, the PQ-interval did not change, but T-wave configuration improved. In the postoperative period, heart failure occurred in 90{\%} of the control group, vs. 12{\%} in patients treated with VNS (p{\textless}0.05). We conclude that CAD is characterized by overactivity of sympathetic cardiac tone. Vagal stimulation reduced sympathetic inflow to the heart, seemingly via an inhibition of norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves. VNS' sympatholytic/vagotonic action dilated cardiac microcirculatory vessels and improved left ventricular contractility in patients with severe CAD.

abstract = {Enhancing vagal tone by delivering electrical stimulation to the vagal nerves (VNS) is emerging as a promising novel therapy in heart failure. In addition, VNS is already an FDA-approved therapy for refractory epilepsy and depression. Besides its well-known negative chronotropic, inotropic, and dromotropic effects, VNS has profound effects on cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmogenesis. This review summarizes current knowledge about the complex relationship between VNS and cardiac arrhythmias. Specifically, the focus is on VNS capability to become a therapeutic strategy along with important electrophysiological alterations that may constitute a potential arrhythmogenic substrate and become a clinical concern. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {The vagus nerve is a major component of the autonomic nervous system and plays a critical role in many body functions including for example, speech, swallowing, heart rate and respiratory control, gastric secretion, and intestinal motility. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) refers to any technique that stimulates the vagus nerve, with electrical stimulation being the most important. Implantable devices for VNS are approved therapy for refractory epilepsy and for treatment-resistant depression. In the case of heart disease applications, implantable VNS has been shown to be beneficial for treating heart failure in both preclinical and clinical studies. Adverse effects of implantable VNS therapy systems are generally associated with the implantation procedure or continuous on-off stimulation. The most serious implantation-associated adverse effect is infection. The effectiveness of non-invasive transcutaneous VNS for epilepsy, depression, primary headaches, heart failure, and other conditions remains under investigation. VNS merits further study for its potentially favorable effects on cardiovascular disease, especially heart failure.},
