abstract = {BACKGROUND: The hemoglobin threshold for transfusion of red cells in patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding is controversial. We compared the efficacy and safety of a restrictive transfusion strategy with those of a liberal transfusion strategy. METHODS: We enrolled 921 patients with severe acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding and randomly assigned 461 of them to a restrictive strategy (transfusion when the hemoglobin level fell below 7 g per deciliter) and 460 to a liberal strategy (transfusion when the hemoglobin fell below 9 g per deciliter). Randomization was stratified according to the presence or absence of liver cirrhosis. RESULTS: A total of 225 patients assigned to the restrictive strategy (51%), as compared with 61 assigned to the liberal strategy (14%), did not receive transfusions (P<0.001) [corrected].The probability of survival at 6 weeks was higher in the restrictive-strategy group than in the liberal-strategy group (95% vs. 91%; hazard ratio for death with restrictive strategy, 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33 to 0.92; P=0.02). Further bleeding occurred in 10% of the patients in the restrictive-strategy group as compared with 16% of the patients in the liberal-strategy group (P=0.01), and adverse events occurred in 40% as compared with 48% (P=0.02). The probability of survival was slightly higher with the restrictive strategy than with the liberal strategy in the subgroup of patients who had bleeding associated with a peptic ulcer (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.26 to 1.25) and was significantly higher in the subgroup of patients with cirrhosis and Child-Pugh class A or B disease (hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.85), but not in those with cirrhosis and Child-Pugh class C disease (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.45 to 2.37). Within the first 5 days, the portal-pressure gradient increased significantly in patients assigned to the liberal strategy (P=0.03) but not in those assigned to the restrictive strategy. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with a liberal transfusion strategy, a restrictive strategy significantly improved outcomes in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

@article{Wilson2007,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {AIM: Stercoral perforation is a rarely suspected life-threatening condition. Early diagnosis is difficult but essential. A comprehensive systematic review was performed to evaluate its presentation, diagnosis and treatment.\n\nMETHOD: A systematic review was carried out of Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed and Cochrane databases for all articles published between 1998 and 2011. Only studies describing stercoral perforation were included.\n\nRESULTS: Twenty-four relevant articles were found including 137 patients (median age = 62 years) with stercoral perforation, of whom 81% had chronic constipation. Stercoral perforation was diagnosed by CT scan in 90% of 31 patients, with the commonest findings being a combination of faecal impaction (84%) and subphrenic (90%) or extraluminal air (61%). The commonest site of perforation was the sigmoid colon (50%) followed by the rectosigmoid junction (24%). The overall mortality was 34%.\n\nCONCLUSION: Stercoral perforation should be suspected in elderly and chronically constipated patients with unexplained abdominal pain and investigated appropriately with a CT scan to allow timely and optimal treatment.},

Information on dietary hygiene, severity of symptoms and dehydration, as well as their management, is essential. Chemoprophylaxis and antibiotic treatment are not recommended, except in very specific situations. The incidence of chronic diarrhea in HIV-positive patients has dramatically decreased since the introduction of HAART. In the absence of any correlation with the initiation of HAART, a stepwise diagnostic workup is indicated (bacteriological cultures and microscopic examination of fecal samples followed by ileocolonoscopy and gastroduodenoscopy). Specific treatment of any pathogens identified, and HAART in the case of microsporidiasis or cryptosporidiosis, constitute the mainstay of therapeutic management of chronic diarrhea in these patients.},

abstract = {Anatomic and physiologic changes introduced by gastric surgery result in clinically significant dumping syndrome in approximately 10% of patients. Dumping is the effect of alteration in the motor functions of the stomach, including disturbances in the gastric reservoir and transporting function. Gastrointestinal hormones play an important role in dumping by mediating responses to surgical resection. Treatment options of dumping syndrome include diet, medications, and surgical revision. Poor nutrition status can be anticipated in patients who fail conservative therapy. Management of refractory dumping syndrome can be a challenge. This review highlights current knowledge about the mechanisms of dumping syndrome and available therapy.},
